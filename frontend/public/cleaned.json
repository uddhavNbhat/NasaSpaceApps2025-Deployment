        "Introduction": "IntroductionAfter a 16-year hiatus, Russia resumed in 2013 its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013), a specially designed automated spacecraft dedicated to life-science experiments. “M” in the mission's name stands for “modernized”; the epithet was equally applicable to the spacecraft and the research program. The principal animal species for physiological studies in this mission was the mouse (Mus musculus). Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-M 1 mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in space for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was made even more so by the requirement to house the males in groups.Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has employed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. The flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments and became world famous for demonstrating that a living organism can withstand rocket launch and weightlessness, thus paving the way for the first human spaceflight. Laika's success also promoted biomedical research with other non-human animals in space that culminated with the Bion biosatellites program. A total of 212 rats and 12 monkeys were launched on 11 satellites and exposed in microgravity for 5.0–22.5 days between 1973 and 1997. Animal experiments on the Bion missions have contributed comprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor, cardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems to spaceflight conditions and the mechanisms underlying these adaptations[1],[2].The use of mice for space experiments offers numerous advantages. Probably the most apparent one is their small size and thus the possibility of utilizing more animals per flight, thus increasing scientific output and the cost-efficiency ratio. Comparisons of data obtained with mice, with those obtained from larger species or humans can also reveal how factors affecting adaptation to spaceflight conditions depend on the size of the organism. The mouse has become the most prevalent “mammalian model” in biomedical research, with a fully described genome and an established role in genetically engineered mutants. While mice are preferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their small size is a debated limitation rather than an advantage for physiological studies. Miniaturization of scientific hardware has reduced some of the disadvantages of the species small size. Finally, the use of genetically controlled mice offers a means to reduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more consistent results.Despite the advantages of the mouse as a model organism for space research, their use was rather limited (apart from a number of experiments with mice during early space exploration in the 1950's and 1960's, which were aimed primarily at testing if living organisms can survive the launch or a brief exposure in microgravity)[3]. Flight experiments with mice were performed aboard STS-90 (“NeuroLab”), STS-108, STS-129, STS-131 (“Mouse Immunology I”), STS-133 (“Mouse Immunology II”), and STS-135 with exposure times ranging from 12 to 16 days. Research programs of these flights were largely focused on studies of muscle, bone/tendon/cartilage, nervous, and cardiovascular systems, and innate and acquired immune responses. Experiments were performed with groups of 30 or fewer female C57BL/6J mice, which were dissected typically shortly after return[4]–[9].The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment of the Italian Space Agency is by far the longest spaceflight of mice to date[10]. In this mission, 6 mice were exposed for 91 days aboard the International Space Station. The advantages offered by the possibility of genetic manipulations with mice were utilized in this experiment; three mice were transgenic with pleiotrophin overexpression (C57BLJ10/ PTN) and three mice were their wild-type counterparts. The MDS habitats required periodic replenishment and servicing by by astronauts. Sadly, half of the mice died during the course of this mission due to various estimated reasons.In the present paper we aim to present a brief overview of the Bion-M 1 mission scientific goals and experimental design. Of particular interest we will focus on the program of mouse training and selection for the experiments, and some outcomes of the Bion-M 1 mission.Overview of the Bion-m 1 missionThe scientific program of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed at obtaining data on mechanisms of adaptation of muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor and nervous systems to prolonged exposure in microgravity and during post-flight recovery. To this aim, functional measurementsin vivowere combined with complementary morphological, biochemical, cellular and molecular studies performedin vitro. To our knowledge, Bion-M 1 is the first study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to normal gravity or to assess post-flightin vivofunctions.Thein vivomeasurements in-flight included video recording of mice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure during all stages of the flight. After the flight, testing of animal behavior, memory and learning, vestibular function, physical activity, strength and fitness, as well as continuous registration of cardiovascular parameters were performed. The set ofin vivomeasurements was designed to provide data on the effects of microgravity on the physiological systems of interest, and to follow the time course of re-adaptation to Earth's gravity after the flight. To reduce the possibility of inadvertently stressing the mice with numerous post-flight tests and thus obscuring the effects of spaceflight, the decision was made to monitor mice in their home cage using an automated data collection system (TSE PhenoMaster) and implantable telemetry, while reducing the number of tests[11]. The program had to be performed with a limited number of animals; thus the use of a repeated measures design. Mice were tested before and after the flight (or its simulation on-ground)[12].Thein vitrostudies were focused on metabolism and the structure and function of tissues from microgravity-exposed mice. More specifically, the individual studies were selected to maximize the scientific yield and targeted the impact of microgravity and other factors specific to spaceflight on biochemical, morphological and, primarily, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation of main physiological systems, such as the central nervous system, sensory systems, skeletal muscle, supporting tissues, including bone and connective tissues, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, neuroendocrine and immune systems.The following organs and tissues were harvested: brain structures, vestibular organs, retina and crystalline lens, spinal cord, muscles of hind limbs and back, vertebral column, fore and hind paw bones, articular and cartilage structures, ligaments, bone marrow, cardiac muscle, arteries from brain and hind legs, lung, intestines, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, skin, salivary glands, testis and blood. These samples were analyzed using morphological (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry), biochemical and a variety of molecular-biology techniques (enzyme-linked immune assays, high-pressure liquid chromatography, western-blot, real-time PCR, whole-genome gene expression). Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using myography and atomic force microscopy. Mice forin vitrostudies were euthanized by cervical dislocation; because of the diversity and number of studies, this method was chosen as the common procedure to reduce variability and one that provided the least interference with the objectives of thein vitrostudies."

        "Title": "Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionOn Earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. Forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Conversely, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced mechanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]and muscle mass[7],[8],[9],[10], and alterations in cardiovascular function[11],[12],[13],[14]. Because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects. Alternatively, it is also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and reach a new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance under reduced mechanical load conditions. Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone.Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns[15],[16],[17],[18],[19]. This is illustrated by a 1–2% loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month[17], which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption[20],[21], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts[17],[18],[22],[23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight[1],[17]and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity. However, of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats[24],[25],[26], although, this result has not been reproduced. In skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important long-term factor in spaceflight. Short of conducting long-term experiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short-term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long-term degenerative effects of microgravity.To perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the tumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor, CDKN1a/p21. P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb-unloaded animals[27], potentially leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb-unloading[28]and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting a role for the p53-signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation[29],[30]. More remarkably, the CDKN1a/p21 knockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth, otherwise unheard of in adult mammals[31]. CDKN1a/p21 can be activated by environmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or be part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell differentiation. This phenotype suggests CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space.Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the mineralized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in osteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium homeostasis[32],[33]. Results from light and electron microscopy of rat bone in a 22-day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977 indicated the appearance of lacunae changed to a “wide” morphology that could contribute to bone loss in space[34]. Recently, it was found that osteocytes acquired a more rounded shape after 91-days in microgravity during the Mice Drawer System experiment on ISS, albeit no statistical significance was obtained due to low n, and the authors did not conclude that osteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring[35]. On the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for 4 weeks[36], leaving the potential role and importance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open question.To address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the initial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in microgravity. Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis."

        "Title": "Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMicrogravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, tissue effects, immune system, cardiomyocytes, cancer biology, human health",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMicrogravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state [1,2]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity—a fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular processes on Earth [3,4,5]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [4,5,6].Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity conditions [1,7,8]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases [1,9,10].This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health."

        "Title": "Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTherapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.\nKeywords:\nadipose-derived stem cell, microgravity culture, polystyrene microsphere, collagen microsphere, multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cell",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHuman adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells from adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of refractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [1], ischemic wounds [2], and diabetic ulcers [3]. However, their clinical efficacy has been limited because the long-term survival of transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [4,5,6]. Consequently, hASC therapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors to promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis [7,8,9,10]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought to be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of embryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12].Modern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell heterogeneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous), a surprising degree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue regeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional individuality within a stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with higher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic benefits through an increased capacity to survive under difficult conditions, to differentiate into various mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16,17,18]. One example of a highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver cirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments.An additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell populations is quite difficult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro expansion of hASCs, are known to lead to a gradual quiescence in stemness indicated, for example, by a decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures have also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although the mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that a microgravity (i.e., weightless) environment had a positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original potencies [24]. However, the forced-floating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes caused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in central necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and advanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with improved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and stress-resistance.The microcarrier system was first introduced in 1967 for the growth of fibroblasts [26], and has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27], hepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually small spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by higher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared to monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous shaking, microcarrier culturing has a multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells, effectively mimicking floating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively expand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations."

        "Title": "Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen\nEscherichia coli\nand mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe ISS National Laboratory is a unique research environment whereby scientists from Academia, Government, and Industry seek to learn the effects of space on life and matter in their many forms. Although a great deal has already been learned about the effects of microgravity on biological systems, [1–3] the large majority of on-orbit experiments do not yield scientific data until long after return of samples to Earth for analysis, creating concerns about timeliness of data availability, and quality of sample preservation [4]. Ground analysis of on-orbit experiments has been necessary because of limited laboratory space, equipment, supplies, and astronaut time resources on ISS, but while this sample return approach maximizes efficient access to space by scientists, it fails to teach us how to conduct end-to-end scientific inquiries in microgravity. As human exploration of the solar system proceeds, human missions to Mars and deep space will require greater levels of autonomy and resourcefulness as outlined in the National Research Council’s Space Exploration Decadal Survey for Life and Physical Sciences [5] An important component of future traveling and living in space away from low Earth orbit will be the ability to perform modern molecular biology analyses, including purifying RNA and conducting Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or other genomic analyses for disease diagnostics including viral and bacterial infection, environmental microorganism identification and monitoring of food and water, and in any other research application where monitoring gene expression is required.Although there are increasing numbers of studies of gene expression in microgravity, there are no reports of any methodologies for RNA purification and RT-qPCR under microgravity conditions, effectively preventing on-orbit analysis of gene expression or PCR-based diagnostics from biological samples. Specifically, recent RNA isolation and PCR-based gene expression studies of biological samples on ISS, Space Shuttle and Biosatellites have been conducted on earth after preserved sample return from space [6–14]. Recent efforts by various groups of investigators have sought to develop portions of an overall genomic and molecular biology experimental capability on ISS. Specifically, these include the NASA Genes in Space 1, miniPCR student experiment, [15] and the “Biomolecular Sequencer” Nanopore DNA sequencing demonstration [16,17] both conducted simultaneously with WetLab-2. Both experiments however, started with genomic DNA samples, not indicative of gene expression, and relied either on sample return to earth for PCR product analysis, (miniPCR), or complex sequencing library preparation on earth prior to nanopore sequencing in space (Biomolecular Sequencer). Neither of these experiments had the end-to-end on-orbit capability to extract RNA from tissue, convert mRNA to cDNA for RT-qPCR, or to generate quantitative gene expression data as we sought to achieve with the WetLab-2 system.To address the pressing ISS research and diagnostics need for novel on-orbit end-to-end molecular biology gene expression analysis methods and tools, we devised a robust microgravity fluidic system that can intake diverse biological sample (cells, tissue, surface swabs, blood, etc.) and using temperature-stable reagents, allow for the isolation and purification of nucleic acids, such as RNA, for molecular biology analysis. In addition, the system includes a microgravity compatible thermal cycler, lyophilized reagents and enzymes for PCR assays and methods for reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, and capabilities for heat inactivation of enzymes such as proteinase K and PCR inhibitors, plus RT-qPCR gene expression analysis using fluorescent TaqMan probes. The WetLab2 suite of instruments and reagents we describe here is novel and unique methodology, substantially distinct from all other existing RNA isolation and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis systems, because of its ability to function in microgravity, with altered fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, convection, and surface tension conditions of space, while still providing full reagent containment for safe operation on ISS. Using this system, schematically shown inFig 1, generic reagents and supplies can be prepositioned on ISS to flexibly support science opportunities such as optimizing plant growth, monitoring the evolution of bacterial communities in biofilms, or analyzing gene expression in immune cells from blood, among many other applications. In addition, the WetLab-2 system was also designed to be capable of purifying RNAs for return to Earth, or for other on-orbit molecular biology analyses such as nanopore array-based mRNA sequencing studies, greatly increasing the analysis capabilities of the system and possibilities for discovery in space.Fig 1. Operations for the WetLab-2 system.Open in a new tabIsolation and purification of RNA from biological tissues on–orbit starts with introduction of cells or tissues for lysis and homogenization into the Sample Preparation Module (SPM), followed by RNA binding to an affinity column, washing, and elution from the module. A Pipette Loader (PL) tool is provided for bubble free fluid transfer to a repeater pipette. This is then used to dispense accurate volumes of purified RNA into a centrifuge rotor/rack of lyophilized reagent tubes with enzymes and regents for reverse transcription and Taqman RT-qPCR. Data is available on-orbit within 3h of initiating the experiment, and transmitted by ISS to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for emailing to investigators within 2 h of clean-up. A more detailed description of the process can be found in theS1 Text.In its validation flight, WetLab-2 successfully demonstrated its capabilities to conduct molecular biology experimentation in microgravity. This consisted of first demonstrating that qPCR functions in microgravity conditions, followed by demonstration of RNA isolation from bacterial cell and mammalian tissue and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR. When gases evolved by thermal cycling accumulated in PCR tubes due to microgravity conditions interfered with data uniformity, the system demonstrated its flexibility and adaptability to on-orbit experiment modification and iteration in real-time. WetLab-2 also used volunteer astronaut time and spare supplies to design and execute follow-up experiments while on-orbit to resolve the gas bubble problem. Below we describe in detail the design and scientific validation of the WetLab-2 suite of methods, reagents, and hardware for RNA purification and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR, enabling future molecular biology experimentation to be conducted end-to-end in real-time on ISS, and allowing data interpretation and experiment redesign while on-orbit."

        "Title": "Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered\nTrp53\nand oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and\nTrp53\nsignaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor,\nNfe2l2 (Nrf2)\n, upregulated\nNox1\nand downregulated\nPtgs2\n, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionResponses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1,2,3]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed.Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [4,5,6]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7].Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work in this area is needed.In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16,17,18]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood.Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceflight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceflight elevatesCdkn1aexpression in bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment.We hypothesized that spaceflight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used thematic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression findings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inflammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET\n56\nFe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either\n56\nFe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose;\n56\nFe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR).

In sum, either protons or\n56\nFe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET\n56\nFe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.\nKeywords:\ncancellous bone, osteoblast, ionizing radiation, spaceflight, oxidative stress",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionStructural degradation and oxidative stress following exposure to space radiation potentially endangers skeletal health of astronauts, both during the mission and later in life. Weightlessness-induced musculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut health [1]. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern because of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions [2,3,4], which can induce oxidative stress [5,6] in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and GCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and γ rays), high linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized56Fe- and12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents, such as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons [4,7]. Estimates of the total absorbed dose during a Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28–47 cGy, with GCR contributing 27 cGy [8,9]. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from a fatal cancer drives the NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit [10], though NASA is investigating additional risks associated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure [11].Irradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in a complex and transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species formation in the marrow [12] and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)[13]. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors [14,15] as well as contribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts [16]. High-LET56Fe (≥200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation during osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in a dose-dependent manner [17]. Further, irradiation in vitro with56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells [18]. At higher doses (400–800 cGy), irradiation with X-rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells [19]. However, the role of oxidative stress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term, in particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized.We posed three principal questions to address in this study. First, are the severity of acute bone loss [12,13,20,21] and impairment of osteoblastogenesis [17] following TBI dependent on radiation type (LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults to skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that: (1) irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure [22], and leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; (2) TBI induces both persistent changes in redox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, (3) addition of an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced damage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress dependent mechanism.To address these questions, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo work, we selected protons and56Fe ions as representative radiation for the abundant low-LET particles in space radiation and the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation, respectively. For in vitro work, we selected137Cs γ rays as a low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure testing. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI (at 200 cGy) with56Fe, while protons had a milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes were observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase (at 200 cGy56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an antioxidant (i.e., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays, but failed to protect fully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionWith the International Space Station (ISS) available for research and habitation for the next decade, there is now a precious opportunity to significantly advance the contributions of space life sciences and space medicine toward enabling the Exploration Class missions (that is, human missions beyond low-Earth orbit). Such missions are currently burdened with significant anticipated crew health and safety challenges.1Coordinated research and development are crucial for producing effective countermeasures against the deleterious influences of spaceflight on the human body. To this end, we emphatically support the development of translational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi-directional information flow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate countermeasure development.As identified by National Academy committees and embedded in the NASA Strategic Plan, a sustainable human spaceflight program requires robust research at bothbasicandappliedlevels to make fundamental biological discoveries and to address the known and emerging risks to human health resulting from the spaceflight environment, respectively.2–5The Life Sciences portfolio at NASA is composed of the Space Biology program (a basic science program), the Human Research Program (HRP, an applied program), and Medical Operations (Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer). Informal translational research within these programs has taken place at NASA for decades, yet there is a need for a more coordinated effort that enables dynamic translation that can take rapid advantage of new findings. In particular, the National Academy committees recommended that NASA follows key elements of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) model of translational science.6,7It was specifically recommended that thecoordinationandmaturationof projects between each level of research be enhanced to increase knowledge transfer and identification of potential solutions for astronaut health challenges.2–4Additionally, the translation of knowledge to Earth-based medical care has recently begun with the designation of the ISS as a National Laboratory (currently through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space).In this paper, we provide context for the current drivers (and needs) for translational research at NASA, briefly summarize the experience at NIH, and lay out a two-phased approach for translational research. As illustrated in Fig.1, the first phase isbasic-to-appliedand the second phase isapplied-to-operational. We define the levels of the research continuum as follows, consistent with the Decadal Survey’s Interim Report:5basic researchaims to generate new biological knowledge using biological systems or model organisms,applied researchaims to develop countermeasures for risks to astronaut health (similar to pre-clinical research), andmedical operationsputs countermeasures into practice for astronauts (like operations in the clinic).Fig. 1.Open in a new tabThe NASA Life Sciences Translational Path.

        "Title": "High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOne potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (\nn\n= 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9;\np\n< 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.\nKeywords:\nFatigue, Bone mechanics, Mouse, Vertebrae, Bone quality",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionA number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a;Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al., 2007;Vestergaard, 2007;Farr and Khosla, 2016;Rubin and Patsch, 2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995;Ominsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006;Turner and Burr, 1993;Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically stiffness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008;Nalla et al., 2003). Biomechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance effects that are difficult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test specimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive findings regarding the role of bone quality.As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing interest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b;Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains a need to refine the experimental protocols for biomechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for cyclic loading. Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved precision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect mechanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number."

        "Title": "Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an\nex vivo\nx-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, (\np\n< 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses (\np\n< 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to\nex vivo\nionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.\nKeywords:\nionizing radiation, bone strength, fatigue, collagen, sterilization, bone-graft",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionFor a variety of clinical applications, bones are exposed to a wide range of ionizing radiation doses.In vivo, radiotherapy treatment results in an accumulated localized dose of ~50 Gy1in cancer patients [1–3].Ex vivo, bone allografts are sterilized at a dose of 30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [4,5]. While these high-dose applications are critical for overall patient health and safety, high levels of ionizing radiation exposure have been shown to increase risk of fracture [6,7]. For example, for women with anal, rectal or colon cancer, those treated with radiation therapy were more than three times as likely to suffer a pelvic fracture than those without radiation therapy [8]. Furthermore, for patients with implanted bone allografts, allografts sterilized with radiation were twice as likely to fail compared to allografts sterilized using other methods [9]. The increased risk of fracture clinically has led to research into the effect of high levels of ionizing radiation exposure on the mechanical and biochemical properties of bone.Numerousex vivostudies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that ionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure independent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties — ultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure — of irradiated bone [10–15] has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure [16–18]. Though the exact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, two mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics [10,12–14,19–23]. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved directly by x- and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. Second, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water molecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within collagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at what dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated with a number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each mechanism (i.e. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into applications of irradiation [22], and also aging [24] and diabetes [25–28].Addressing these issues, we conducted anex vivoionizing radiation experiment on mouse vertebrae spanning a range of clinically-related radiation doses (i.e. radiation therapy to allograft sterilization) and conducted a suite of mechanical and biochemical assays to assess radiation-induced changes. Specifically, our objectives were to: 1) quantify the effects of radiation dose on the monotonic strength and fatigue life of murine vertebrae; and 2) determine whether the degradation in mechanical properties is dominated by the amount of non-enzymatic crosslinks or fragmented collagen."

        "Title": "Absence of gamma-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan.\nMethods\nWe examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG\n-/-\n) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.\nResults\nC2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG\n-/-\ncultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG\n-/-\nmice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG\n-/-\nisolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG\n-/-\nmuscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG\n-/-\nmuscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated.\nConclusions\np70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.\nKeywords:\nSarcoglycan, Sarcoglycanopathies, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Mechanotransduction, Mechano-sensing, Load-sensing, p70S6K, S6K, p70S6 kinase, ERK1/2",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAn efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”.In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004).Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network).syp42−/−syp43−/−double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungusGolovinomyces orontiiinfection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012).A research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thalianaGlycosylTransferase-LikeProtein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence.Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures areN-glycans,O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood.In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThetrans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or threetrans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack (Staehelin and Kang, 2008;Kang, 2011;Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains for various trafficking routes (Bassham et al., 2000;Chow et al., 2008;Gendre et al., 2011). The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006;Viotti et al., 2010) that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004;Robatzek et al., 2006;Dhonukshe et al., 2007;Takano et al., 2010;Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in trafficking of biosynthetic traffic to the vacuole (Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009;Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and Jurgens, 2011;Reyes et al., 2011;Contento and Bassham, 2012).High transport fidelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle trafficking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs;Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classified as target SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al., 1998). The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of a tetramerictrans-SNARE complex (McNew et al., 2000;Lipka et al., 2007;Kim and Brandizzi, 2012;Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012;Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulatingtrans-SNARE complex formation (Cai et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular trafficking efficiency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009;Chia and Gleeson, 2011;Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al., 2007;Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled-coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation of trafficking steps in the cell also requires a family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream effectors (Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab effectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007;Sztul and Lupashin, 2009;Hong and Lev, 2014).Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist inArabidopsis thaliana, with different localizations reflecting their specialized roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000;Uemura et al., 2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar trafficking (Uemura et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct traffic to the plasma membrane (Drakakaki et al., 2012), with a role in mediating stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identified as a SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased trafficking fidelity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011).SYP42 and SYP43 play a role in root gravitropism, most likely via regulation of the localization of the auxin eﬄux transporters PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012). Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin influx transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008;Rakusová et al., 2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008;Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus affect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010).Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein trafficking and auxin transporters, we investigated auxin responses in thetno1mutant during root development. Loss of TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally,tno1roots failed to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin response markerDR5rev:GFPat the LR tips as well as after gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root development and response to gravity."

        "Title": "The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMaintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed\nDrosophila\northolog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of\nspag4\nmRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole.

This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the\nDrosophila\ngenome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of\nspag4\nin this centriole attachment pathway.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionWithin eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999;Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994;Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999;Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005;Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003;Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes.Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC-Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005;Starr and Fischer, 2005;Crisp et al., 2006;Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006;Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002;Hodzic et al., 2004;King et al., 2008;Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002;Zhang et al., 2002;Fischer et al., 2004;Wilhelmsen et al., 2005;Ketema et al., 2007). A detailed model for the mechanism by which theCaenorhabditis elegansKASH protein ZYG-12 links the zygotic centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE) has been proposed (Malone et al., 2003), which involves direct interaction of certain ZYG-12 isoforms with the microtubule motor dynein.TheDrosophilagenome encodes two KASH protein genes,klarsicht(Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999) andmsp-300(Zhang et al., 2002) and two SUN protein genes,klaroid(Kracklauer et al., 2007) and geneCG6589. CG6589, previously termedgiacomo, has proved to have sequence homology to the testis-specific mammalian SUN protein Spag4 (Shao et al., 1999;Kennedy et al., 2004) (supplementary material Fig. S1) and thus we have re-named the genespag4. We show here that Spag4 has a crucial role in spermatogenesis comparable to that of other SUN proteins: it is necessary for anchoring the centriole or basal body (BB) to the spermatid nucleus. But surprisingly, this role does not require formation of a typical LINC complex with a KASH protein. Instead, we have shown that the coiled-coil cytoplasmic protein Yuri Gagarin (Armstrong et al., 2006;Texada et al., 2008) is an essential component of the Spag4-BB anchoring mechanism, and that regulation of dynein-dynactin localization by Spag4 has a role in the process."

        "Title": "Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the\nyuri gagarin\ngene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHuman space exploration, with its promise of unprecedented discoveries, excites the imagination. However, turning the exploration of space into a practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration, a better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required. Among the many aspects of biology affected by spaceflight, we have focused on the immune response. Immune dysfunction is a major health-related problem on earth and a major obstacle to long-term space missions[1]. As early as the Apollo and Skylab missions, immune dysfunction was recognized in astronauts, and later studies documented specific host cellular and humoral immune alterations induced by spaceflight[1]. Increased microbial growth and virulence in space have also been documented[2]. Spaceflight is associated with many stresses, with altered gravitational force (g) representing the most studied factor. Microgravity (µg) is constant in space, and hypergravity (hyper g) is experienced during launch and landing. Immune dysfunction in both µg and hyper g is well documented, but determination of the underlying cellular mechanisms and thus routes to appropriate countermeasures, remains unresolved[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. Without normal immune function, many threats to long-term survival in space exist: fatal infections, failed immunosurveillance of cancer cells, aberrant inflammatory responses and reactivation of latent viruses are all potential hazards.In our work, we have brought advances in understanding the host defense of Drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight. Drosophila is a well-established model for human innate immune function, sharing elements in cellular and humoral immunity, clotting and wound healing, and signaling pathways[7]. Drosophila responds to microbial infection with 1) a systemic response, characterized by fat body production of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), 2) tissue specific responses, such as production of AMPs in the gut and trachea, 3) phagocytosis by hemocytes, and 4) clotting and wound healing[7],[8],[9],[10].Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in Drosophila[7],[11],[12]. The Toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and Gram-positive (Lys-type peptidoglycan (PGN)) infections, and the Imd pathway responds to Gram-negative (DAP-type PGN) infections[7]. Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) have been identified in mammals and are the direct mediators of responses to activators such as bacterial lipopolysacccharide and viral DNA[13]. Imd shares homology with the death domain of the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor pathway[7]. Downstream, through the conserved NF-kB/Rel protein transcription factors relish (Imd signaling cascade), and DIF and dorsal (Toll signaling cascade), the AMPs and ∼400 other genes are involved in response to infection[7],[14],[15]. Recognition of the complexity of the Toll and Imd pathways continues to grow, for example with identification of new regulators, interactions with the nervous system, and modification with aging[16],[17],[18],[19]. In contrast to mammals, in Drosophila only the original Toll was associated with infection response, through indirect sensing mediated by binding to Spätzle (Spz). More recently however, other Toll family members have been identified as mediating infection. Toll-8 regulates infection response in the airway epithelium[20], and Toll-7 is involved in viral recognition and response[21].The mechanisms of interactions within and between the Toll and Imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood, and unraveling the interrelationships will require many approaches. Here, we present genetic and transcriptional profiling experiments to address the response to infection in conditions related to space travel: Does hypergravity affect the response to fungal infection? Does development during spaceflight alter the response to bacterial and fungal infections?"

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n\n56\nFe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS).

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionLong-duration space travel has been associated with a number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [1,2,3,4]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated.Space radiation observed on the International Space Station (ISS) is quite different from ionizing radiation found on Earth and is composed primarily of protons (both high and low energy) and HZE ions (high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions). Protons are characterized by low linear energy transfer (LET) and HZE by high LET, as opposed to the low LET radiation (x-, β-, or γ-rays) to which humans are commonly exposed to on Earth [1,3,10,11,12,13]. HZE ions are positively charged and are the highly ionizing components of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) which originate outside of the solar system. The strong carcinogenic potential of HZE [14] has been a concern for many decades and has been considered the biggest risk factor for human health in missions beyond LEO [13,15]. In contrast, in LEO, where the ISS is located, the radiation dose from HZE is reduced due to the protection provided by the Earth’s magnetosphere, and is roughly equal to the dose from low-energy protons trapped in the inner radiation belt [13,16]. Most of the ISS orbit lies inside the radiation belts; the majority of the dose is from passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the inner belt drops down to ISS altitudes. An additional risk for missions beyond LEO is from acute doses of high-energy protons from periodic solar particle events (SPEs) [14]. Data on the biological effects of space radiation has been obtained sporadically in true space conditions from samples flown in LEO (ISS, Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station, satellites carrying biology payloads). The majority of our data has been generated by simulating space radiation on Earth using specific HZE ions or protons at facilities such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulated space radiation ground experiments have typically focused a lot more on HZE, reflecting the space radiation environment encountered in a long-duration beyond LEO mission [17]. To this day, a variety of results indicates that space radiation can increased cancer risk as well as contribute to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), muscle degeneration, bone loss, and cardiovascular disease [10,15].Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [7,18,19,20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as 2 Gy [21,22,23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [7,20,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, one experiment showed that mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of 150 MeV protons or 0.5 Gy of 600 MeV/n iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29].56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is a commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (e.g., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question.To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA’s GeneLab platform is a resource available to the public that has provided the first comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for five different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one spaceflight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Using a systems biology approach, we were able to suggest a novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32,33,34,35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Briefly, FYN is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN’s involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be a tumor suppressor [40,41], a key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and inflammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/2 signaling [43]. For our findings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased inflammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show a molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This finding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of a life to space environment. More generally, these novel findings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for spaceflight."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOver the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data. The high feature-number aspect of these big data has highlighted the importance of data sharing (or reuse) functions of these systems, as data sets often have relevance for investigating a very large number of hypotheses. Thus, developers of big data systems increasingly are focusing on the needs of users to discover, annotate, share, and analyze data. Omics data sharing is especially crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems1-3, databases4-14, and knowledge bases15-17for omics and other systems biology data.The FAIR18principles are a set of guiding principles that are being advocated as foundational in the broad areas of data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. However, the challenges involved in using current technologies and real-world infrastructures within organizational guidelines to develop data repositories and/or data analytical systems that are “FAIR” are substantial. The FAIR principles deal with aspects of data handling such as identification, representation, and attribution. Metrics to evaluate the “FAIRness” of a data system or its design are also currently being developed19. System developers should consider familiarizing themselves with these metrics, as many of the FAIR principles can have significant implications in terms of feasible design options and operations resource planning.We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS), along with four systems in the research omics data domain chosen for their similarity to the GLDS, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate these assessments in the context of discussion of the FAIRness concepts for the design of Big Data omics systems in particular, relating some of the challenges we faced developing the GLDS as a FAIR data system. In addition to designing a data system to be FAIR, developers of Big Data systems in particular should consider how system design can maximize data usability for its users. We propose two new design principles for FAIR systems that handle Big Data like omics data from our experiences developing the GLDS. By complying with these usability principles and the FAIR principles together, systems that manage Big Data can maximize both the usability and reusability of data."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpace is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail effects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological effects. One of the major environmental factors in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceflight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1].Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas affecting human health bone loss [2], skeletal muscle atrophy [3,4,5], reproductive hazards in women and men [6], cognitive/behavioral changes [7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14].At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological effects from spaceflight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are affected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19]. Conflicting results on cellular stemness [20] have been reported with effects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clarification [21,22].A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceflight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceflight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulfite-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceflight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health effects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health.In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceflight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceflight environment. The studies identified were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples flown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space flight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent differences (mixed fields now being offered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation."

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).\nResults\nWe have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOuter space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.\nKeywords:\nspace exploration, microgravity, space radiation, astronaut health, female reproductive system, gynecological cancers",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHuman spaceflight and deep space exploration are the aspirational activities of numerous national space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA), as well as many commercial and other private entities. Studies to determine the long-term physiological responses and adaptation to the space environment and further re-adaptation to the environmental conditions on Earth are of crucial importance to the safety and health of the astronauts [1].Beyond the stressors of getting to space, such as vibration and acceleration forces, microgravity and radiation are the most significant hazards during space travel [2]. There are other sources of physiological and psychological stress during spaceflight, including circadian shifting, dietary alterations, confined spaces, and isolation [2]. The impact of spaceflight and the cosmic environment on those organ systems essential to carry out tasks in space (motor skills, cardiovascular system, and maintenance of overall bodily function) and which are essential upon return to Earth, have received the majority of focus as they relate to studies of astronaut health and wellbeing.A long-standing concern has also been the effects of the cosmic environment on male and female reproductive health including carcinogenesis of the primary reproductive organs secondary to cosmic radiation exposure. However, this area of research lags behind. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, oncology and radiotherapy have provided more insights in recent years [2]; however, there is a paucity of research evaluating the risks of gynecological cancers, ovarian insufficiency, or infertility following spaceflight. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of what is known so far from studies conducted on Earth, together with the research questions and challenges requiring further study to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of female astronauts following long-duration spaceflight."

        "Title": "Muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression during spaceflight is linked to a metabolic crosstalk in both the liver and the muscle in mice.",
        "Abstract": null,
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species.This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, confinement, isolation, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceflight systemic and physiological health risks have been identified: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Muscle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many studies have documented spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions.The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features of dysregulated metabolism.Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016;Beheshti et al., 2019). Beheshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipotoxic pathways was a specific response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver diseases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005;Perry et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space flight (STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceflight and bedrest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016;Tobin et al., 2002). In mice flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of thelongissimus dorsiwas mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceflight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceflight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the flight astronaut, consistent with metabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle atrophy and a potential reciprocal influence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy et al., 2020;Meyer et al., 2020;Rudrappa et al., 2016;Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020;Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the relationship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated.In this study, we describe for the first time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceflight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic field. The mixOmics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research areas (Duruflé et al., 2021;González et al., 2012)."

        "Title": "Chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture influence DNA methylation patterns triggered by galactic cosmic radiation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDespite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (\n56\nFe,\n28\nSi) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily\n56\nFe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas\n28\nSi and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.\nSubject terms:\nComputational biology and bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Space physics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWith a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5.Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6investigated an effect of high-LET56Fe,28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7showing that56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET56Fe ion exposure.Chromatin packages the eukaryotic genome through DNA folding ranging from single nucleosome to entire chromosome8. Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes consisting of two copies of four positively charged histone proteins9. In addition to the core chromatin components, histone-modifying enzymes may alter chromatin compaction by changing its accessibility. The accessibility level is connected with chromatin modifications. In particular, H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were used to profile ‘active’ and ‘repressed’ promoters respectively. Furthermore, histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) was used to profile heterochromatin loci and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to profile enhancers10.There were a few reports suggesting that high-LET4and ultraviolet11induced DNA damage may be affected by chromatin structure. However, until now there are no studies investigating a DNA methylation pattern induced by low-/high-LET and spatial chromosomal conformation capture to explore the effects of chromatin physical properties on irradiation outcome. Importantly, with the recent development of high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation methods (Hi-C)12and advanced algorithms to simulate the three-dimensional structure of nuclei such as Chrom3D, it is now possible to address the irradiation effects associated with chromatin conformation13. Recently, to access the multi-dimensional chromatin interactions researches were using Hi-C data for compartmentalization dividing chromatin into compartments associated with gene expression regulation14,15.For the purpose of our work, we used Hi-C data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers. Additionally, we characterized each layer separately using various of epigenetic and transcriptomic features. Specifically, we explored an effect of high-LET and low-LET ions on methylation DNA patterns in human lung epithelial cells using a previously published dataset of Kennedy et al.6. Further, we tried to understand how the radiation penetrates cell nucleus and influences methylation levels in distinct layers of nucleus, as well as how spatial chromosomal conformation and epigenetic architecture influence DNA alterations triggered by external radiation. To achieve this, we used existing publicly availablein-vitroandin-vivodata and performed the following analyses: (1) Hi-C analysis to check how three-dimensional structure of cell nucleus impacts response to irradiation. Additionally, we divided cell nucleus into five laterally distributed layers to identify potential irradiation effects associated with peripheral and internal positioning of chromatin and other epigenetic features; (2) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data to assess the impact of distinct histone modifications on DNA methylation changes and (3) microarrays, and RNA-seq data to assess the impact of gene expression on irradiation response.This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, driven by the increasing interest in space travel. Our study builds on existing knowledge, investigating the influence of DNA structure on radiation outcomes. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect DNA methylation alterations induced by low- and high-LET ions. Leveraging recent technological advances, such as high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation, we created a nuanced nuclear division with five nonoverlapping nuclear layers to better understand the spatial distribution of chromatin and its features, as well as its impact on radiation response. Our multiomics approach integrates Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and microarray/RNA-seq data, providing insights into the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, gene expression and the cellular response to GCR. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs of January 13, 2023, over 671 million cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide have been reported, and more than 6.71 million lives have been claimed globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal [1], ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape [2]. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health.SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes viruses such as OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in a helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike (S) proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to allow for viral membrane fusion. Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts. To read in more detail these processes, as well as structural elements of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, see our first review, ref. [3], focusing on intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral effects [3].In this second of a three-part comprehensive series of our series of SARS-CoV-2 reviews, we cover the extracellular and circulating signals and physiological effects of the viral disease, including the consequences and remodeling of organs, metabolism, humoral factors, and the immune system. In turn, the aim of this review series is to provide an overview of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its biological effects from basic biology to clinical patient outcomes, highlighting also future areas of research given the ever-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19, and its consequences for healthcare across the world."

        "Title": "Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHuman space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.\nSubject terms:\nGenetics, Medical research",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMissions beyond low Earth orbit are the new frontier of crewed space exploration. Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk2–4. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress3,5(Fig.1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others6. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging3.Figure 1.Open in a new tabEffects of spaceflight and a model of aging. Human spaceflight presents five major challenges: space radiation, altered gravity, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, and hostile/closed environments are hazards for crewed spaceflight. These stressors support pathophysiological alterations and cellular and molecular changes which could be involved in the development of biological aging and frailty in astronauts. Muscle loss in astronauts has a similar pathophysiology as sarcopenia in the elderly. Created using BioRender.Aging is a state of depleted biological resilience resulting in an increased vulnerability to stressors. It leads to a systemic loss of the body’s capacity to maintain homeostasis and health3. The aging phenotype manifests in metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological deterioration, and cancer7. Old age is also marked by immune dysregulation, which can result in a chronic low-grade inflammation state calledinflammaging, a status associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in blood and tissues8. The deterioration in muscle quality and quantity is another feature of aging, characterized by altered myofiber metabolism and impaired satellite cell activity9. Loss of muscle mass increases the risk of developing other comorbidities, in a vicious cycle that leads to unhealthy aging. These traits are often associated with a multifactorial geriatric syndrome known as “frailty”10.Frailty, a recent concept in aging science, can be defined as a syndrome caused by the combined effect of numerous age-related alterations. These alterations lead to a depletion of physiological reserve and/or deterioration of cognitive functions, resulting in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Frailty can be clinically diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following components: unintentional weight loss over the last year, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity level11. Other criteria for diagnosing and assessing frailty are functional factors such as grip strength and gait speed12,13. More holistic definitions of frailty also consider the presence of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, psychosocial risk factors and other common geriatric syndromes14. The use of clinical scores to quantify frailty has been attempted, but it is undermined by encountered limitations in terms of ethnicity, risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, advancements in the understanding of the biological processes related to frailty and aging, along with the development of high-throughput techniques, allowed the development of novel assessment models based on “omics” biomarkers15.Part of the deconditioning of human physiology caused by spaceflight resembles the features of frail patients, for instance the physical component related to muscle loss.Sarcopenia is generally defined as a progressive age-related condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle quality, performance, strength, and mass16. When this condition is driven by aging, it is defined as primary sarcopenia9. Interestingly, muscle loss in astronauts shares similarities with sarcopenia in the elderly, especially during long duration spaceflight, and could be interpreted as a sarcopenia-like syndrome17,18.The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging’s biological pathways, which could be elicited by the space environment. Yet, despite the reported similarities between the features of frailty and consequence of spaceflight, it remains unclear whether the space environment can influence the onset of age-related dysfunctions in astronauts. Getting insights about the signatures of frailty and sarcopenia in spaceflight data is a key step towards the development of countermeasures to achieve safer crewed space missions and translate therapy to patients on Earth. Here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts, murine and cellular models. We investigate this occurrence using multi-omics and systems-informatic approaches. We analyzed transcriptomic data from rodent research missions flown to the International Space Station (ISS) (available from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), previously known as GeneLab18), astronaut data from a recent JAXA study, and data from the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (i4). We identified altered expression in genes related to frailty and muscle loss, that may lead to an early frailty phenotype. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflammation, muscle wasting and other age-related features. Our findings propose a method to study the development of frailty-related health risks, which astronauts may develop during spaceflight, in the perspective of achieving adequate preventative measures."

        "Title": "Space radiation damage rescued by inhibition of key spaceflight associated miRNAs",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOur previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (\ni.e\n., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage.\nSubject terms:\nSystems analysis, Predictive markers, Cardiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity fields, and prolonged isolation in a hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of spaceflight crews. The biological consequences of spaceflight also present a unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially3–5.Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non-autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can be used as biomarkers6,7, and are associated with human diseases8–10. We have extensively characterized a circulating miRNA signature associated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3D human-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure11–14. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space-flown animal models11and revealed a conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovascular system and was widely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvessel collapse13and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15caused by space radiation exposure.Multi-omic analyses of biomedical profiles of astronauts along with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to spaceflight-associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mitochondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellular metabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscular and neurological disorders16.Here, a 3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularly focusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved with cardiovascular damage. We find that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we confirm the specific targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study17, a JAXA mission18, and the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as countermeasures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate spaceflight damage and reduce human health risks in human spaceflight missions."

        "Title": "Ethical considerations for the age of non-governmental space exploration",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations.\nSubject terms:\nEthics, Medical research",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIt has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the first crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201, a new era of public-private spaceflight partnership has emerged. Private companies such as Boeing, Virgin Galactic, Axiom, Sierra Space, and Blue Origin now create a steep commercial demand for crewed spaceflight, both for technological and recreational purposes. NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world’s first commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial spaceflights, ranging from suborbital flights lasting mere minutes to Axiom’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the first all-civilian orbital commercial spaceflight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4’ (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3.Historically, government-sponsored spaceflights were mission-based and geared towards national interests, e.g., technological leadership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, or advancements in research. After the Cold War era and the “Space Race,” government investment in space exploration declined. In contrast, the idea of commercial spaceflight continues to gain significant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enormous. This has been accompanied by an influx of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable Launch Vehicle models by SpaceX4. Despite this rapid technology development, governmental regulation of commercial spaceflight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial spaceflight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety, payload, payload re-entry, financial stability, and coverage for maximum probable loss5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsored astronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating to space activities from 42 countries6. While the regulations listed there cover a wide range of fields, such as objects in space, radiocommunication, and space activities, there is a general lack of health-associated regulations. This is a symptom of a bigger problem where there is little oversight of private sector spaceflight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon7, and the upcoming Polaris program8, are already a reality.An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with a more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical standards and improve treatment choices for prolonged spaceflight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At the same time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronauts to private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existing medical conditions, there is a need to refine selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite their importance and urgency, these considerations have gone relatively unexplored9.In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues related to space exploration – both commercial and otherwise10–19– our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human subject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might be covered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish the ethical considerations we discuss. A good example illustrating this point is NASA’s recent decision to unify the effective radiation exposure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv, which translates to having to remain below 3% mean risk of cancer mortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences in male and female radiation-based cancer risk20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically problematic. Likewise, signing a consent form to undertake a certain activity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make the proposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from the increase in private and commercial spaceflight arise despite established rules and guidelines22,23.A note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as ‘crew’. This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crew than ‘ordinary’ spaceflight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term ‘spaceflight occupants’ (SOs), using it to refer to non-professional space travelers lacking substantial spaceflight training. Further, we use the terms ‘laws’ and ‘regulations’ to refer to binding law and the neutral terms ‘guidelines’, ‘recommendations’, and ‘policy’ to refer to non-binding guiding instruments."

        "Title": "Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhile it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that\nSerratia marcescens\n(strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to\nDrosophila melanogaster\nafter growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of\nS. marcescens\ndid not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground.

Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways\nImd\nand\nToll\n, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.\nSubject terms:\nInfection, Innate immunity, Microbiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response ofDrosophila melanogasteris highly similar to humans,25,27,28with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29The human opportunistic bacteriaSerratia marcescenshas only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31Furthermore,S. marcescenshas been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens.D. melanogasterhas been recently used as a model for studyingS. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes toS. marcescensusing a model system.Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogenSerratia marcescenswas sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infectD. melanogasterto investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence ofSerratia marcescensonD. melanogasterhosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of theD. melanogasterhost and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground."

        "Title": "Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPrimary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.\nKeywords:\nactin, root growth, cell elongation, auxin, gravitropism, actin-binding protein, light",
        "Introduction": "Introduction: The Actin Cytoskeleton and Primary Root GrowthThe root system is an essential part of the plant that navigates the soil for water and nutrients. The primary root is the first organ to emerge from the seed, and therefore, its developmental plasticity is of utmost importance. The cytoskeleton is an interconnected filamentous network that is the key in controlling cell shape, rigidity, supports intracellular processes, and consists of microtubules and actin filaments (AF). AF consist of two helical strands of actin monomers that grow from the barbed plus end (compared to the pointed minus end) and rely on a plethora of actin-binding proteins to modify their organization and dynamics. Actin filaments are crucial for cell and tissue growth and participate in a large variety of processes including cell architecture and polarity establishment, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, cell division, and response to pathogens. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton is known to be an important player in vesicle trafficking, secretion, and endocytosis as well as endomembrane remodeling. By controlling the growth and division of cell, the actin cytoskeleton provides the means to dynamically respond to intracellular and extracellular stimuli (Mao et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2016;Maeda et al., 2020) (Reviewed inPaez-Garcia et al., 2018;Li and Day, 2019;Takatsuka and Ito, 2020;Yang et al., 2020). The actin cytoskeleton responds to an extensive amount of stimuli, such as gravity, osmotic stress, pathogens, nutrients, and light (Henty-Ridilla et al., 2013;Leontovyčová et al., 2019) (Reviewed inLi and Day, 2019;Nakamura et al., 2019;Wang and Mao, 2019;Leontovyčová et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2021). Plant hormones, and especially auxin, have strong effects on the composition of actin filaments (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Reviewed inZhu and Geisler, 2015). The actin cytoskeleton has been studied extensively; however, the role that it plays in regulating the growth of the primary root is complex and often yields conflicting data. We hereby review how actin helps root growth. We first discuss how actin filaments organize during root growth. Then, we dissect how individual components of the actin filaments and the actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Next, we describe the evidence on how the hormones controlling growth affect the actin cytoskeleton and finally we discuss how actin affects the root tropisms to gravity and light."

        "Title": "Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhen positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (\nZea mays\n) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed\nZ. mays\nroots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (\nMedicago truncatula\n) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed\nZ. mays\nroots, eBL effects on F-actin in living\nM. truncatula\nroots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated\nM. truncatula\nseedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.\nKeywords:\nautotropism, actin, brassinosteroids, clinostat, cytoskeleton, gravitropism, root development",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from a perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector (Sack, 1997;Tasaka et al., 1999;Kiss, 2000). The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003;Sato et al., 2015).Plant organs typically have a defined gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of a specific organ is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of a defined growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with a GSA of 180˚ and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with a GSA of 0˚. Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have a GSA between these values (Firn and Digby, 1997).Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status (Roychoudhry et al., 2013;Roychoudhry et al., 2017). Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as a composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism (Stankovic et al., 1998a;Stanković et al., 1998b). Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (i.e. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution (Swarup et al., 2001;Rakusova et al., 2015), there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways (Guisinger and Kiss, 1999;Lofke et al., 2013;Vandenbussche et al., 2013;Pernisova et al., 2016). By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself (Myers et al., 1995) or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending (Tarui and Iino, 1999;Bastien et al., 2013;Okamoto et al., 2015). It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on a clinostat or in microgravity (Stanković et al., 1998b).The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism (Blancaflor, 2002;Bisgrove, 2008). Microtubules and filamentous-actin (F-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are defined by many regulatory proteins (Blancaflor, 2013). Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to a horizontal reorientation was quantified (Blancaflor, 2002). Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of F-actin such as latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin B can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots (Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997;Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002;Blancaflor et al., 2003;Hou et al., 2003;Hou et al., 2004). The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with F-actin antagonists was recapitulated inArabidopsis thalianamutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms (Kato et al., 2010;Lanza et al., 2012). Furthermore, theA. thaliana shoot gravitropic response9(sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment (Nakamura et al., 2011). Recently, delayed root gravitropism inA. thaliana actin-related protein 3(arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled F-actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure (Zhou et al., 2016). It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation (Blancaflor, 2013). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally.As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots (Meudt, 1987;Kim et al., 2000;Li et al., 2005;Kim et al., 2007;Lanza et al., 2012). The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin (Kim et al., 2000;Kim et al., 2007). InA. thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants), a small GTPase regulator of F-actin dynamics (Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization inA. thalianaroots in a manner similar to that of auxin (Lanza et al., 2012). Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be a component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants.The promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution (Hou et al., 2003;Hou et al., 2004;Li et al., 2005;Lanza et al., 2012;Blancaflor, 2013). However, a recent study withA. thalianamutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB- or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). In the study byOkamoto et al. (2015), inflorescence stems ofA. thalianamyosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature ofZ. maysroots treated with LatB (Hou et al., 2003). Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in a similar manner as LatB-treated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBL-mediated alterations in F-actin dynamics and organization."

        "Title": "Cell type-specific imaging of calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using GCaMP3.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nCytoplasmic calcium ([Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\n) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\nlevels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\nin plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as\nCauliflower Mosaic Virus\n(\n35S\n) and\nUbiquitin10\n(\nUBQ10\n) to drive expression of\nGCaMP\nin all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\nresponses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of\nArabidopsis thaliana\nlines expressing\nGCaMP3\nin five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\nsignature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca\n2+\n]\ncyt\nincreases in root cells.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionCalcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+acts as a stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+and an efflux of stored Ca2+from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via a concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+stores and the cytoplasm [1]. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [1,2,3]. This low concentration is maintained through H+/Ca2+antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [3,4]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [2], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane.Once Ca2+enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate a second messenger cascade [4,5]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+as a second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-1. When Ca2+levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to a specific stimulus, these indicator dyes increased fluorescence [6]. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [6,7].Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of a suite of fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and other marine organisms [8,9]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these fluorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+binding [8]. Ca2+binding induced changes in the conformation of fluorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced fluorescence emission. One example of a genetically-encoded Ca2+sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [1,10]. GCaMP3 is a modified form of GCaMP that features a circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP) flanked by CaM and M13 that gives low fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+to the CaM domain [11].To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such asCauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S)andUbiquitin 10 (UBQ10)[12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cytchanges across entire plant organs [5,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique [Ca2+]cytsignature. While [Ca2+]cytchanges typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within specific tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated a set of lines in the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, expressingGCaMP3targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type specific promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cytchanges in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cytincreases in plants."

        "Title": "Spatial and temporal localization of SPIRRIG and WAVE/SCAR reveal roles for these proteins in actin-mediated root hair development.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nRoot hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in\nArabidopsis thaliana\nroot hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in\nspi\nand the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in\nbrk1\nand\nscar1234\n. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRoot hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017;Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth, a process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves a balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi compartments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a).Open in a new tabRoot epidermal cells called trichoblasts are the cell types that form root hairs. Work inArabidopsis thalianahas shown that trichoblasts are specified to become root hair-forming cells early during root development through the patterned assembly of protein complexes of transcriptional activators and repressors in different cell files (Schiefelbein et al., 2014;Shibata et al., 2018). Upon establishing their identity, trichoblasts undergo two developmental stages that lead to root hair outgrowth. The first stage is the establishment of a root hair initiation domain (RHID) that eventually leads to a conspicuous root hair bulge at the basal (root-tip oriented) end of the trichoblast (Grierson et al., 2014;Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). Several proteins accumulate at the RHID, most prominently, the Rho of Plants (ROP) small GTPases and their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activators (Denninger et al., 2019). The second stage is tip growth. In addition to small GTPases, the cytoskeleton, the endomembrane trafficking machinery, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide lipids, hormones (e.g. auxin and ethylene), and reactive oxygen species are other major players in signaling pathways that modulate root hair development (Bascom et al., 2018a;Nakamura and Grebe, 2018).The filamentous-actin (F-actin) and microtubule cytoskeletons orchestrate root hair development. The actin cytoskeleton in particular has been studied widely during tip growth, as it functions as tracks for the trafficking of cellular cargo to the cell apex (Stephan, 2017;Bascom et al., 2018a;Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). Many insights into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in tip growth have been demonstrated through work with Arabidopsis mutants and pharmacological approaches involving the use of chemicals that disrupt F-actin. For example, the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B (LatB) inhibits tip growth, while also inducing the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes with irregular shapes (Bibikova et al., 1999;Gibbon et al., 1999). In this regard, Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the root hair-expressed vegetativeACTIN2(ACT2) gene are characterized by root hairs that mirror those treated with LatB (Ringli et al., 2002;Yoo et al., 2012). Furthermore,ACT2andACT7mutants display an apical (shoot-ward) shift in the position of the RHID compared to the wild-type (Kiefer et al., 2015).To fulfill its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton is organized into higher order networks that correspond to the growth strategy of the cell. This is evident in tip-growing cells, whereby the base and shank of the cell consist mostly of thick, longitudinal F-actin bundles, while the apex contains actin fringes, rings, patches, or a fine meshwork, depending on the plant species or cell type (Stephan, 2017). To sustain tip growth, the integrity and organization of these tip-focused F-actin arrays must be maintained, a task facilitated by a diverse collection of actin-binding proteins and actin nucleators (Li et al., 2015;Paez-Garcia, 2018;Szymanski and Staiger, 2018).The actin-related protein (ARP2/3) complex and its activator, suppressor of cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex (W/SC), is one of the most well-characterized actin nucleators in plants (Deeks and Hussey, 2005;Szymanski, 2005;Yanagisawa et al., 2013). Upon conversion from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation, the ARP2/3 complex promotes F-actin nucleation from the sides of existing filaments by forming a surface that mimics stable actin dimers (Blanchoin et al., 2000;Robinson et al., 2001;Rodal et al., 2005). Activation of ARP2/3 for efficient nucleation of F-actin requires the W/SC nucleation promoting factor (NPF) complex. In addition to W/SC, the NPF consists of the proteins SRA1, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC300/BRICK1 (BRK1) (Basu et al., 2004,2005;El-Assal et al., 2004;Djakovic et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2005b,2008;Jörgens et al., 2010). Studies of Arabidopsis trichome development have been most instrumental in revealing insights into the function of W/SC-ARP2/3 in plants. Plant counterparts to the mammalian W/SC-ARP2/3 subunits were first uncovered through the cloning of disrupted genes in a set ofDISTORTED(DIS) Arabidopsis trichome mutants (Hülskamp et al., 1994;Le et al., 2003;Mathur et al., 2003;Basu et al., 2004;Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004;Zhang et al., 2005a). W/SC is the only known NPF for ARP2/3, andBRK1andSCARmutants display nullarp2/3trichome phenotypes (Le et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2008).In addition to trichome development, the W/SC-ARP2/3 actin filament-nucleating module has been implicated in specifying leaf pavement cell shape, light and auxin-dependent root growth, stomatal gating, gravitropism, responses to salinity stress, and plant immunity (Li et al., 2003;Basu et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2005a;Dyachok et al., 2011;Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014;Zou et al., 2016;Isner et al., 2017;Pratap Sahi et al., 2018;Badet et al., 2019). The W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have been shown to play essential roles in some tip growing cells, such as the protonemal cells of the mossPhyscomitrium(formerlyPhyscomitrella)patens. This was shown when RNA interference of transcripts encoding selected subunits of the moss W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes resulted in substantial protonemal tip growth defects (Harries et al., 2005;Perroud and Quatrano, 2006;Finka et al., 2008). The importance of the W/SC andARP2/3 complexes was further demonstrated byPerroud and Quatrano (2006,2008), who showed that two of its components, BRK1 and ARPC4, accumulated in tips of moss protonemal cells. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants with mutations in components of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes displayed minimal or no defects in root hair or pollen tube growth (Li et al., 2003;Mathur et al., 2003), and none of the subunits have been conclusively shown to exhibit clear polar localization in these cell types. Therefore, the extent by which the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes function in tip growing cells of plants remains to be determined.SPIRRIG(SPI) is one of eight genes that has been considered to be a member of theDISgroup, but compared to otherDISmutants, the trichome phenotypes ofspiare less severe and the mutant does not display early stage cell swelling that is diagnostic of theDISgroup (Schwab et al., 2003).SPIwas shown to encode a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo and concanavalin A-like lectin domains and C-terminally located pleckstrin homology, beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH), and WD40 repeat domains (Saedler et al., 2009). BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis, and receptor signaling. This family of proteins is of clinical importance as they have been implicated in a variety of human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmunity syndrome, and autism (Cullinane et al., 2013).In addition to mild trichome defects, ArabidopsisSPImutants have short root hairs characterized by fragmented vacuoles, suggesting that SPI, like other eukaryotic BEACH domain-containing proteins, functions in membrane trafficking (Saedler et al., 2009). Additionally,Steffens et al. (2017)showed that SPI physically interacts with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, reinforcing its role in membrane remodeling. SPI was also demonstrated to localize to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis epidermal cells, thereby suggesting a novel role for SPI in post-transcriptional regulation (Steffens et al., 2015). BecauseSPIhad a substantial but incomplete overlap with distorted mutant phenotypes, it was suggested that SPI might be involved in actin-mediated cell developmental processes (Saedler et al., 2009), and perhaps function in coordination with W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes. However, SPI is not a known W/SC or ARP2/3 subunit; therefore, its relationship to ARP2/3 function is unclear. Moreover, the uncertainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype whenSPIis mutated, remains unknown.In the current study, we addressed these questions by generating a fully functional SPI fluorescent protein fusion and documented its spatial and temporal localization during root hair development. In addition, we used live cell microscopy to simultaneously image the dynamics of SPI and W/SC and correlate SPI localization with root hair tip-focused F-actin. Taken together, our results point to potential functional relationships among SPI, W/SC, and actin during root hair development."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown.Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive.To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1gfor 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1gon living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19.This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel."

        "Title": "S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhile the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The\nM. tuberculosis\nchannel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the\nS. aureus\nprotein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the\nE. coli\nMscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C\n8\nE\n5\ndetergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological “emergency release valve,” allowing rapid loss of solutes in response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacterium's environment[1]. It is perhaps the best characterized mechanosensor[2], thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces[3]. Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception.The original model for theE. coliMscL (EcoMscL) stoichiometry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits[4]. This model then appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional crystallization of EcoMscL[5]. But the subsequent elucidation of theM. tuberculosischannel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography[6]then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for this orthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry[6],[7], which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystallization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry. Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was most likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of theS. aureushomolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant[8]. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore, we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and MtMscL[8], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry."

Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionTheE. coli mscLwas the first gene definitively shown to encode a mechanosensitive channel activity.1The encoded mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) protein (EcoMscL) is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels, serving as a paradigm for how a protein can sense membrane tension.2A crystal structure fromM. tuberculosisMscL (MtMscL) was first obtained by Douglas Rees' group in 1998, depicting what appeared to be a closed state of the channel.3,4It was a homopentamer with each subunit containing two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal α-helical bundle. The same group recently obtained a second crystal structure from a C-terminal truncatedS. aureusMscL (SaMscL) in what they speculated to be an expanded intermediate state; surprisingly, this was a tetramer.5A different oligomeric state was unexpected given that the two orthologs are highly conserved [Fig. 1(A)], as is the entire MscL family.6–8To further investigate the discrepancy between the stoichiometry of these two channels, several studies have been performed. In one study, we developed anin vivodisulfide-trapping assay to determine the state of theS. aureuschannel when in its native membrane environment; it was unambiguously a pentamer, demonstrating that the crystal did not reflect a native state of the protein.9Thus, two possibilities existed: either the truncation of the C-terminal bundle altered channel stoichiometry to tetramer, or the detergent solubilization did. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugations and light scattering, we concluded that on solubilization with the detergentn-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as a tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergents did not alter stoichiometry.9However, the influence of protein truncation was not assessed. Indeed, one previous study ofin vitrotranslated and n-Octyl-Beta-D-Glucopyranoside (OG) solubilized EcoMscL implied that the C-terminal end of the protein played a critical role in assembly.10Recently, using a new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees' group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that a SaMscL with the C-terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heterogeneous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pentamers and tetramers. Thus, it appeared that the C-terminal helical bundle does influence the oligomeric state of the protein. However, because both of these studies used detergent-solubilized proteins, it was unclear if the C-terminal region of the protein played a role in MscL stoichiometryin vivo. Here, we utilize ourin vivodisulfide-trapping assay to address this issue.Figure 1.Open in a new tabAlignment of MscL homologs and protein modifications. A: Sequence alignment of three MscL homologs fromE. coli(EcoMscL),M. tuberculosis(MtMscL), andS. aureus(SaMscL) showing the regions corresponding to the different protein domains. The degree of conservation is color coded with dark blue residues indicating identity and light blue similarity. The red arrows at the C-terminal end of SaMscL sequence indicate the sites were the stop codons were added to generate the different C-terminal truncated constructs. B: Localization of residues A10 (red) and L97 (blue) inM. tuberculosisMscL, corresponding to L10 and M91 in SaMscL. These residues were substituted to cysteines for thein vivodisulfide trapping experiments. A lateral view (left) and bottom view (right) are shown. C: Crystal structure ofM. tuberculosisMscL, showing a pentameric stoichiometry. The inset shows a detail of the C-terminal domain and the location of the C-terminal truncations.To evaluate the role of the c-terminal region of SaMscL in its oligomeric state, we have generated multiple C-terminal truncated constructs of different lengths that have two cysteine mutations (L10C/M91C;Fig. 1). As can be seen inFigure 1(B), these two sites are predicted to be in close proximity in the closed state3and have been shown previously to generate the most efficientin vivocrosslinking.9We investigated the FL channel as well as four different C-terminal deletions: Δ95 (which was the truncation crystallized as a tetramer), Δ99, Δ103, and Δ107. Two of these truncations, Δ95 and Δ99, are located in the linker between TM2 and the cytoplasmic helix and the other two are in the cytoplasmic helix itself [Fig. 1(A,C)]. As previously described, bacteria expressing the different constructs were given an osmotic shock in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this removes cellular reducing agents such as glutathione while adding an oxidant. The treated cells were pelleted, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading buffer, and the MscL protein visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot. Note that the protein is trapped in its native membrane environment because no solubilization or protein handling is involved before SDS PAGE. As shown inFigure 2(left and center panels), SaMscL exists almost exclusively as a pentamer regardless of the length of the C-terminal truncation. Although a ladder of monomer through pentamer can be observed for 10C/91C Δ95 SaMscL in the no-shock/nontreated protein, in the presence of an oxidizer the pentamer becomes the prevalent band in a time dependant manner (Fig. 2, right panel). Note that for the SaMscL single cysteine mutants under the same treatment, no other species than monomer was observed for M91C but a small proportion of L10C existed as dimmers (Supplemental information). Dimerization of L10C was expected as the equivalent mutant from EcoMscL, M12C, also form dimmers under similar treatment.11Finally, we show by patch clamp of native membranes that both FL and Δ95 truncated 10C/91C SaMscL respond similarly to changes in the redox potential of the bath (Fig. 3). In the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), both channels are functional and activity can be observed in response to negative pressures applied to the membrane patch (left traces). After perfusion with a 3% peroxide solution, channel activity could no longer be elicited even under high negative pressures (right traces). These results are consistent with the channels being locked closed after disulfide trapping, suggesting that in native membranes the FL and truncated channels are structural and functionally similar. Hence,in vivothe C-terminal helical bundle plays no detectable role in proper pentameric assembly.Figure 2.Open in a new tabDisulfide trapping experiments show that C-terminally truncated SaMscL protein exists as a pentamerin vivo. Western blot analysis of WT SaMscL, double cysteine mutant 10C/91C SaMscL FL and with Δ95 truncation (left panel). All samples were either nonshocked (NS) or shocked (S+) in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper phenanthroline. When shocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline the majority of 10C/91C exists as a pentamer, independent of the length of the C-terminal truncation (left and central panels). A ladder of monomer through pentamer is already present in the nonshock sample; pentamer becomes the major band when osmotically downshocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this occurs in a time-dependent manner (right panel). Note that no detergent solubilization before resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer is performed in these experiments.Figure 3.Open in a new tabThe FL and truncated SaMscL 10C/91C channels are functionally similar. The electrophysiological data shows single-channel activities of both SaMscL 10C/91C FL and the truncated construct Δ95 SaMscL 10C/91C. Channel openings are seen as upward deflections. Both channels respond equally to changes in the redox potential of the bath. In the presence of the reducing agent DTT, the channels are functional and activity can be observed at the indicated pressures (left traces), but after perfusing a peroxide solution in the bath, the channel activity is lost (right traces).Many previous studies have concluded that MtMscL and EcoMscL are also pentamers. A study using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium, and size-exclusion chromatography showed EcoMscL as a pentamer;12another study using crosslinking and electron microscopy reached the same conclusion.10The crystal structure of MtMscL as well as the recent OCAM analysis also showed a pentameric structure for this ortholog.13Finally, when studied by using ourin vivodisulfide trapping in native membranes, all three MscL homologs have shown pentameric stoichiometry (Supplementary Information). Hence, there appears to be no variability in the oligomeric state of these MscL orthologs.Collectively, the data suggest that the C-terminal domain of the SaMscL channel only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the protein when it is solubilized in detergent. Different detergents seem to have different abilities to alter MscL oligomeric structure. It appears that LDAO is the harshest detergent in this sense, leading to oligomeric rearrangement of the full-length SaMscL protein.9DDM and perhaps other detergents can lead to rearrangements of only the truncated, not FL, SaMscL.13However, there also appear to be species differences; from the OCAM study, the FL EcoMscL appears to form hexamers as well as pentamers when solubilized in DDM. In addition, the same study demonstrated that truncation of the MtMscL did not destabilize the pentameric organization when solubilized in DDM.13Hence, detergents alone can cause specific protein complexes to rearrange their oligomeric state while others appear stable. As detergent solubilization is a critical and necessary step to obtain membrane proteins for crystallization and other biophysical and structural studies, where possible, a complementary set of data assessing the oligomeric statein vivoseems advisable."

In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) ofE. coliis to date one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how channels sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.1The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation2; upon a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane tension3acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4in response to membrane tensions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5A crystal structure of MscL from the homologM. tuberculosishas been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7(Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now suggests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for theS. aureusortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is a detergent-specific process11,12; hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here.Open in a new tabFigure 1.Schematic representation of MscL from the crystal structure ofM. tuberculosis. (A) The scheme on the left represents a pentameric MscL in a closed state with the S1 and TM2cidomains, in which the cysteine substitutions were performed, highlighted for clarity. The approximate location of the membrane is shown with horizontal gray lines. A single subunit is shown on the right to indicate all different MscL domains. (B)The same model with CPK representation of its residues shows how close the S1 and TM2cidomains are predicted to be in the closed structure of MscL. In the bottom view it can be appreciated that the S1 and TM2cidomains of alternating subunits, not direct neighbors, interact with each other.Upon gating, the best evidence suggests that the two transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane; as they do so, the first transmembrane TM1 twists in a cork-screw-like manner in a clockwise direction (when observed from the periplasm), and the channel then opens like the iris of an old-fashion camera. Note that in the crystal structure a vestibule of the closed pore is observed within the periplasmic side of the membrane, with the pore constriction occurring in the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane domains. Several studies have shown that this cytoplasmic-constriction region is important for channel gating. The N-terminal helix (S1) lies along the membrane and has been shown necessary for channel gating13,14; It appears to anchor TM1 to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to guide its tilting within the membrane during the gating process.15,16The region of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface, (TM2ci;Fig. 1), has also been shown to influence the gating process. One of the residues within this subdomain, N103, has been shown to be incorporated into the membrane upon gating, presumably to accommodate for the longer tilted TM domains in the open state. Several additional residues in the TM2ciregion are also crucial for this transition, thus tuning the gating of the channel.Although the structural data from the MscL crystal structure shows that the S1 and TM2cidomains are in very close proximity (Fig. 1B), little is known about protein-protein interactions in this region and their possible influence in the gating process. In this study we use an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to screen 143 double cysteine mutants to generate a detailed map of protein-protein interactions between S1 and TM2cidomains. Furthermore, to understand the dynamics of these interactions during the closed to open transition inE. coliMscL, we analyze the effects in single channel activity of different redox conditions by patch clamp. Two sets of mutants have shown changes in their activities under different redox conditions and suggest a model consistent with a concerted motion of the S1 domain and TM2ci."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSingle-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces.The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a;Blount et al., 2007;Blount et al., 2008b;Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels fromEscherichia coli(E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012;Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009;Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch.X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue fromMycobacterium tuberculosis(Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998;Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also seeFig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for theStaphylococcus aureus(S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamersin vivo(Dorwart et al., 2010;Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family.Figure 1.

The schematic illustration of MscL is also shown above the sequence alignment with S1, TM1, TM2 and c-terminal helix domains shown as boxes and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops shown as lines.Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005;Maurer et al., 2000;Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has a sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% withE. coliMscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that a site at the membrane interface plays such a crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionWater is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost complete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2. This phenomenon of “anhydrobiosis”, or “life without water” has attracted a great deal of attention because it may reveal Nature’s strategies to endure adverse environments and open up ways to achieve efficient preservation of living matter. However, the precise mechanisms behind anhydrobiosis remain elusive, as they may involve a complex combination of protective proteins, solutes, and cellular machinery working in a concert3.Several molecules have been identified as mediators of desiccation tolerance in various organisms. One is the disaccharide trehalose, which accumulates in a large quantity in animals such as brine shrimps or nematodes4. Trehalose uptake enhances the survival of yeast and human cells under drying conditions and may protect dehydrated cells by vitrification (turning the cell interior into a glass-like state)4–6. Several “intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)”, which lack fixed tertiary structure, have also been associated with desiccation tolerance2. For instance, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins are tolerance molecules found in plant seeds and anhydrobiotic species7. LEA proteins are mostly unstructured in an aqueous environment and assume helical structure upon desiccation to alleviate damage due to drying7,8.Recent studies on the survival mode of tardigrades revealed novel classes of stress proteins. Tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic animals that can survive under a broad range of environmental stressors, including desiccation, high and low temperatures, radiation, and even exposure to outer space9–11. Tardigrades express LEA proteins, and also three different families termed “tardigrade disordered proteins” (TDPs) unique to the phylum Tardigrada12. Some of these TDPs are highly disordered and less likely to undergo aggregation at high temperatures. (The classification of TDPs as disordered proteins is based on a sequence-based prediction13.) Three different groups of TDPs were termed cytoplasmic-, mitochondrial- and secretory-abundant heat soluble (CAHS, MAHS, SAHS) proteins according to their putative subcellular localization (Fig.1a). In each family, the proteins show sequence similarity14,15. TDPs are either constitutively expressed at high levels or enriched upon desiccation and knocking out even one CAHS or SAHS gene can cause diminished desiccation tolerance13.Fig. 1.

Tardigrades express unique sets of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs).

Sequence-based structural prediction suggested that, unlike CAHS and MAHS proteins that are estimated to be highly disordered, the 42 putative SAHS proteins from tardigrade speciesHypsibius exemplaris, Ramazzottius varieornatus, Paramacrobiotus richtersiandMilnesium tardigradumare more ordered13. Fukuda et al. solved the structure ofR. varieornatusSAHS1 and SAHS416,17, experimentally verifying that, at least under hydrated conditions, the SAHS proteins have defined structures, and their description as “intrinsically disordered proteins” is not accurate. RvSAHS1 and 4 proteins share sequence and structural similarity to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs): their structures include β-barrels with large internal cavities that correspond to the fatty acid binding pockets in FABPs16,17. The function of these large cavities in the SAHS proteins is unclear, as is their biochemical mechanism in protecting against desiccation. Additionally, AlphaFold structures are available on the protein structure database (PDB) for all SAHS proteins identified fromR. varieornatusandH. exemplaris.In this study, we investigated SAHS proteins from tardigradesR. varieornatusandHypsibius exemplarisfor their potential to protect various biological structures from desiccation-induced damage. We expressed four different SAHS proteins and found that they can specifically protect liposomes and bacterial cells but not enzymes upon desiccation. SAHS proteins undergo structural changes under dehydration with trifluoroethanol. Finally, we performed molecular dynamic and bioinformatic analyses to identify structural features of the SAHS proteins that may contribute to desiccation protection. These studies lead to a model for SAHS protein action, and also illustrate that SAHS proteins may be practical preservatives for cells in commercial applications."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAnhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in\nRamazzottius varieornatus\n. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.\nKeywords:\nanhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation tolerance",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAnhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism (Croweet al., 1998;Keilin, 1959). An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more (García, 2011;Hibshmanet al., 2020;Leprince and Buitink, 2015). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Croweet al., 1998;Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (Goyalet al., 2005;Kikawadaet al., 2006;MacRae, 2016), heat shock proteins (Cornetteet al., 2010;King and MacRae, 2015), and ROS scavenging (Gusevet al., 2010;Rizzoet al., 2010) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance (Janiset al., 2018).Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state (Rebecchiet al., 2007;Wright, 2001). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuneret al., 2010;Rizzoet al., 2010;Schokraieet al., 2011;Yoshidaet al., 2022), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat-soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed inRamazzottius varieornatus, which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance withoutde novogene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade,Hypsibius exemplaris, the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance (Arakawa, 2022;Kondoet al., 2015,2019;Yoshidaet al., 2017). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic predictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous structuresin vitroand in cells (Malkiet al., 2022;Tanakaet al., 2022;Velinget al., 2022;Yagi-Utsumiet al., 2021). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, andDrosphilaS2 cells (Boothbyet al., 2017;Tanakaet al., 2022). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells.In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization ofR. varieornatusCAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWater unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade\nParamacrobiotus spatialis\nwas used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the\nP. spatialis\nwas evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.\nSubject terms:\nEvolution, Zoology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionInsufficient hydration is extremely stressful for living organisms as water is required for metabolic reactions. Nevertheless, some animals living in habitats subject to periodic or unpredictable desiccation periods have evolved a remarkable adaptive strategy called anhydrobiosis. This physiological state allows for the nearly complete dehydration of the animal’s body and cells, a reduced or suspended metabolism leading to a temporary suspension of active life processes, and finally a developmental standstill as a direct response to the desiccation of the surrounding habitat of the animals1–4. This state is reversed by the reappearance of environmental water, with the restoring of metabolism and of all features of active life, even after the permanence in a desiccated state for months to decades1,2,4–6. However, anhydrobiosis, as well as the time spent in a desiccated state, can still cause cellular damages, including membrane destabilization, protein and nucleic acid denaturation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress with the eventual death of organisms7–16.To withstand stress caused by the drastic loss of body water, many anhydrobiotic animals first slow the rate of their dehydration by modifying their body in a compact structure that reduces the surface area, and consequently the evaporation rate17–19. Simultaneously, they undergo biochemical changes associated with the synthesis of molecules working as bioprotectants, which replace cellular water or stabilize cellular machinery13,20–27. To gain insights into anhydrobiosis and what bioprotectants help to mediate this phenomenon, tardigrades are an attractive model.Tardigrades are hygrophilous animals that need to be surrounded by a film of water to perform active life. As a consequence, their capability to colonise terrestrial environments (e.g. moss, lichen, soil, and leaf litter) is linked to their well-known ability to enter anhydrobiosis at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult28. As their surroundings lose water, tardigrades lose most (> 95%) of their free and bound body water and suspend their metabolism3. The loss of water is accompanied by the invagination of the intersegmental cuticle and by the retraction of the head and legs, resulting in a compact tun-shaped body3,29,30. Anhydrobiotic (desiccated) tardigrades can withstand several physical and chemical extremes (e.g. very low and high temperature, high pressure, vacuum, organic solvents and radiations) that are far more extreme than that imposed by their natural habitats, including space conditions3,25,26,31–36. As well as in other anhydrobiotic animals, the desiccation in tardigrades is accomplished through morphological changes (tun) together with the synthesis of different bioprotectants20–22,24–27. These molecules include, for example, osmolytes, trehalose, antioxidants, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Aquaporin Proteins (AQPs) and Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), including the Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins (LEA)13,20–22,24–27. Trehalose, a disaccharide with high ability for water-replacement during dehydration, immobilising macromolecules and stabilizing cellular structure through vitrification has long been implicated in desiccation tolerance20,26,37. The presence and the amount of trehalose detected in tardigrades are different from species to species27, but is much lower than the one recorded in other anhydrobiotic animals that use trehalose as mechanism to reduce damages induced by desiccation1,38–40. Therefore, the degree of involvement of trehalose as a protective molecule in anhydrobiotic tardigrades is still debated27. Antioxidants, such as scavenging enzymes, limit oxidative stress, which appears to be one of the most deleterious damages associated with desiccation9. The depletion of water changes the ionic concentration of anhydrobiotic organisms, including tardigrades41, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)9,11,42,43, consisting in free radicals [e.g. superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH·), perhydroxy radical (HO2·)] and non-radical forms [e.g.hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2)]44. Water loss therefore increases the susceptibility of biomolecules to the attack of reactive oxygen molecules, damaging proteins, membranes, and DNA9,11,13,22,27,42,43. Since aquaporins contribute to water transport through plasma membranes, some researchers have suggested that they play some role in anhydrobiosis, hypothesizing their involvement in the regulation of water loss to fine tune desiccation kinetics11,23,45–47. However, it remains unclear if aquaporins function in preparing anhydrobiotic animals for desiccation or play a role in rehydration.In this paper, the eutardigradeParamacrobiotus spatialisGuidetti et al., 2019 was selected as a model organism (Fig.1) in light of its robust ability to survive desiccation10,48. To understand what bioprotectants might be involved in mitigating the stresses imposed by desiccation, we first sought to identify exactly what those stresses are. As mentioned above, water loss can lead to the generation of deleterious ROS, however this has never been directly tested before in tardigrades. To verify whether desiccation induces production of ROS in tardigrades, we analysed the ROS production in the coelomocytes (storage cells; Fig.1c). Coelomocytes are round free-floating cells in the body cavity of tardigrades which act as reservoirs and transporters of lipids and glycogen49–52. The number of storage cells in a tardigrade specimen is in the range of a few hundred up to more than 1000 cells according to the species4,52,53, while their size changes along with animal life cycle including oocyte developmental in females54. Contrasting data are reported about the decline in size and number of storage cells after a period of anhydrobiosis in tardigrade species51–53. A decline in size of storage cells is due to the use of stored material as energy requirements to enter and exit anhydrobiosis51.Figure 1.Open in a new tabParamacrobiotus spatialis.

Genes encoding five antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase), for two aquaporins (aquaporins 3 and 10) and for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were thus targeted using RNA interference (RNAi), and later the successful recover ofP. spatialisspecimens after desiccation was verified."

        "Title": "Partial weight suspension: A novel murine model for investigating adaptation to reduced musculoskeletal loading.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWe developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity environments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass,\nP\n< 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both\nP\n< 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment,\nP\n< 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.\nKeywords:\nmice, unloading, disuse osteoporosis, partial weightbearing, spaceflight",

        "Title": "Partial reductions in mechanical loading yield proportional changes in bone density, bone architecture, and muscle mass",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.\nKeywords:\nMECHANICAL LOADING, DISUSE, MECHANOSTAT, FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATION, WEIGHT BEARING",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAccording to Frost’s mechanostat theory,(1,2)bone adapts its structure to maintain the strain engendered by physiological loading within a threshold range. Studies using animal models of overloading (mechanical loading above the threshold range) have allowed further refinement to the mechanostat theory by describing the dependence of bone formation on mechanical parameters such as strain rate, strain frequency, strain magnitude, loading history, daily strain stimulus, and rest insertion.(3)Animal studies have also been used to investigate musculoskeletal adaptation to underloading (loading below the threshold range) using complete unloading of the hindlimbs via tail suspension,(4)denervation,(5)tendon resection,(6)cast immobilization,(7)and muscle paralysis via botulinum toxin A.(8)However, the musculoskeletal responses to lesser degrees of unloading are still ill defined for lack of a suitable animal model. Thus, fundamental questions regarding the rate, extent, and distribution of disuse-induced bone loss and their dependence on a particular mechanical stimulus level are as yet unanswered. Delineating the relationships between mechanical stimuli and skeletal responses along this unloading continuum is crucial for mitigating deleterious skeletal effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke. Additionally, understanding this association can aid in assessing the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and injury resulting from space exploration in partial gravity environments.(9)To address this gap in knowledge, our group previously developed the partial weight suspension (PWS) system(10)that enables long-term exposure of mice to partial loading while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. We previously implemented this model for one loading condition, 38% weight bearing, and reported bone and muscle atrophy that was less for this partial weight bearing (PWB) condition than prior studies employing tail suspension.(10)However, this work did not explore a range of partial loading levels or compare outcomes directly to a traditional model of unloading, namely hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension. Additionally, gait characterization was incomplete, because only gait kinetics was measured without assessing how PWB might affect gait kinematics. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to employ the PWS model to further explore musculoskeletal adaptation along the continuum of loading between disuse and normal weight bearing. Our primary question was whether variable PWB differentially influences muscle atrophy and bone loss. In particular, we hypothesized there would be a linear relationship between the extent of weight bearing and the degree of bone and muscle loss. In addition, we further characterized the PWS model by studying gait kinematics, systemic stress, and the effect of the harnessing apparatus itself on bone and muscle outcomes."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionExposure to prolonged disuse or microgravity produces a variety of effects on skeletal muscle, including fiber atrophy, a reduction in maximal force, and reduced endurance1. For example, given the major alterations that can ensue even after just several days of exposure to microgravity, human spaceflight currently requires astronauts to participate in daily exercise countermeasures to help offset the effects of weightlessness2. Although a recent report suggests that high intensity exercise combined with optimal nutrition may mitigate bone and muscle loss3, novel approaches to reduce negative effects of spaceflight or prolonged bed rest/immobilization on musculoskeletal health, including drug therapies, are being sought4,5.Diagnostic tools for the assessment of muscle and bone loss due to disuse or weightlessness are, however, quite limited. Standard methods used to evaluate these changes such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography6,7are expensive and inconvenient for regular clinical use. Moreover, they are not feasible in spaceflight, given the size, weight, and power requirements of the equipment. Ultrasound is being studied for muscle loss assessment in spaceflight, but quantifying the measurements requires substantial procedural modification8. Simple force-testing dynamometers are inconvenient and inaccurate to use on debilitated patients and are virtually impossible to use in space. For these reasons, other non-invasive approaches that can be applied easily and rapidly to both patients and astronauts are of interest. One approach that offers potential value is electrical impedance myography (EIM). EIM is a technique in which a high-frequency, low-energy electrical current is applied to a localized area of muscle and the resulting surface voltages are measured9. EIM is a specialized version of methods developed in the well-studied field of bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy, in which alterations in the characteristics of a tissue or cellular suspension are characterized by the their electrical frequency-dependent properties10-13. In addition to these non-muscular studies, at least one investigation has evaluated the specific relationship between muscle cell size and bioimpedance parameters in tissue culture14.Since the EIM technique is painless, rapid to apply, non-invasive, and the equipment lightweight, it has the potential to serve as a useful method for monitoring muscle status. Earlier studies have shown that surface EIM alterations are closely tied to muscle fiber size15. Importantly, data in humans16and in rats17support that EIM is sensitive to changes in muscle following disuse, with reductions in EIM parameters of greater than 30% from baseline, and thus may also have the potential to sensitively identify the impact of disuse or microgravity on muscle health. Here we further explore the potential application of EIM for the assessment of muscle impacted by disuse by studyingex vivomuscle obtained from mice exposed to reduced mechanical loading via hind limb unloading (HLU) or spaceflight, testing the basic hypothesis that such disuse will consistently alter EIM values."

        "Title": "Spaceflight Activates Lipotoxic Pathways in Mouse Liver",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.\nSubject terms:\nMolecular biology, Proteomics, Risk factors, Transcriptomics, Systems biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight affects several physiological and biochemical processes in astronauts and rodent models. The most reported changes from the space environment are in muscle and bone loss1,2. Several studies also indicate that spaceflight affects components of the immune system, including the distribution and functionality of peripheral leukocytes, and activity of cytokines3. In addition, several decades of spaceflight investigations have eluded that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that happen in microgravity4.Research involving spaceflight and simulated ground-based microgravity studies (i.e. bedrest studies) result in manifestation of similar diseases such as diabetes, sedentary states, and aging4. Insulin resistance is believed to be a key risk factor for fatty liver disease, which is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. To date, little work has been done on other tissues such as liver or pancreas because these tissues are not considered to be at risk for long-term spaceflight missions. However, with the increasing precision of omics technology, the approach to evaluate risk from long space missions may find a new paradigm. For example, liver, a critical organ for mammals, has been largely under-studied in the context of spaceflight environment. It performs array of functions that help support both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism among others functions, such as immunity, digestion, detoxification, amino acid catabolism, bile formation, and vitamin storage5,6. It is connected with nearly every system in the body, hence, it is prone to a variety of pathophysiologies.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is multifactorial in nature and comprises multiple pathways for disease progression. The initial insult is believed to be insulin resistance which could lead to more progressive steatosis with associated hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)7. Two complicated individual stages of the disease are believed to exist, NAFLD which is comprised of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)7. NAFL is characterized by steatosis of the liver, involving more than 5% of parenchyma, with no evidence of hepatocyte injury8. NASH is a necroinflammatory involving hepatic stellate cells and other pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-17, causing the liver cells to become injured in a background of steatosis8. The mechanism of progression for NAFL to NASH is currently unclear, but early evidence eludes to the sequential development of the disease7.Interestingly, one study from Jonscheret al. has reported findings in mice flown for 13 days aboard the Space Transportation System (STS)−135 to have liver damage through accumulation of hepatic lipids droplets, elevated triglyceride levels, and loss of retinoids from the hepatic stellate cells (HSC) lipid droplets9. These results were correlated with the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα is a transcriptional modulator of genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, fatty acid transport and hepatic glucose production, the latter being rodent-specific10. Pro-inflammatory and acute phase response signaling pathways are negatively regulating PPARα, as seen in rodent models of systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)11,12. Dysregulation of the PPARα signaling can lead to the generation of markers which are known to be precursor to early nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-like symptoms13,14. Pecautet al. demonstrated later from the same tissue that there were also increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased insulin levels15. In addition, Blaberet al. was able to uncover that a decrease with the defense mechanisms associated with hepatic oxidation (i.e. involving genes associated with autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome) can induce mitochondrial dysfunction through senescence from a multi-omics analysis utilizing rodent livers from the STS-135 mission16. Lastly, several proteomic studies on the liver related to NAFLD have revealed key pathways being regulated in the liver which include cell cycle, glucose metabolism, autophagy, ketogenesis, and fatty acid transport that corresponds with what is being observed with the spaceflight samples17,18.Astronauts’ data have shown similar physiological changes involving diabetogenic responses to microgravity such as reduced glucose tolerance, increased plasma glucose, relative decrease in circulating insulin and increased C-peptide excretion and insulin resistance4. Since astronauts and cosmonauts displayed subclinical glucose intolerance and issues with insulin secretion and metabolism4, deeper study of the effects of microgravity on liver function are essential to understand the implications of long-term space travel.One important confounding factor for experiments conducted on the Space Shuttle is that animals were typically brought back live, with animals experiencing the stresses of re-entry and brief re-adaptation to Earth gravity. Sacrifice of animals were done 3.5 to 5.5 hours from de-orbit for mice from the STS-135 missions. Liver is known to be susceptible to stress, and live return may therefore have elicited molecular changes in the organs collected9. In other words, previous observations done on Space Shuttle samples may partially reflect changes in the liver that were only transient and were not induced by life in space.In this study, we performed histology on archived liver tissues obtained from Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) from mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS). In these samples, mice were sacrificed in space and the experimental duration was much longer, removing the stress factor that could be observed when collecting tissue near the travel time. The same tissue had already been processed for both transcriptomics and proteomics by the GeneLab team and raw data was archived on NASA’s GeneLab database platform19–21. We therefore conducted pathway analysis on data from the same animals to see what molecular changes were revealed by omics. Our results demonstrate large changes in lipid localization and lipid and fatty acid metabolism and processing, regardless of strain and flight conditions. We confirmed that PPARα signaling is modified in the space environment. In addition, we also identified novel pathways and factors, which are correlated with early onset of liver diseases involving GCG and the circadian clock pathway. We believe this comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight induced liver damage warrants more investigations at the human level."

        "Title": "Treatment with a soluble bone morphogenetic protein type 1A receptor (BMPR1A) fusion protein increases bone mass and bone formation in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading.",
        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPrevious work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (\nn\n= 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%,\np\n< 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts (\np\n< 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (\np\n< 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors\nJBMR Plus\npublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\nKeywords:\nBMPS/TGF‐βS, BONE HISTOMORPHOMETRY, BONE QCT/μCT, BIOMECHANICS, PRECLINICAL STUDIES",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMechanical loading is essential to skeletal health, because muscle and bone atrophy occur in the setting of disuse. This disuse osteoporosis results in bone loss rates of 1% to 2% per month at weight bearing sites in those exposed to prolonged periods of reduced mechanical loading, such as occurs with paralysis, bed rest during recovery from injury or illness, or spaceflight.1Current treatments for prevention of disuse osteoporosis rely on anti‐resorptive agents that lower the rate of bone turnover, decreasing both resorption and formation over time. Further, although bisphosphonate therapy inhibits bone loss in astronauts2and in patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries,3,4,5there is limited evidence of increased BMD, as is normally seen in postmenopausal women treated with bisphosphonates.6Thus, a treatment that not only inhibits bone resorption but also stimulates bone formation may be desirable in the setting of severe disuse. Intermittent parathyroid hormone, or teriparatide, is the only clinically available treatment that promotes bone formation. However, intermittent PTH therapy also induces bone resorption and in some cases transient hypercalcemia, both of which are undesirable in the setting of disuse, in which negative calcium balance and high calcium excretion are common.1,7Given the profound bone loss seen in disuse, treatments that promote bone formation while limiting resorption would be ideal.Previous work demonstrates that a soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2/4 specifically and with high affinity.8This in turn inhibits dickkopf‐1 (Dkk1) expression in osteoblasts to activate canonical Wnt signaling to promote bone formation. In addition, receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblasts is reduced with the treatment, resulting in decreased bone resorption. Thus, treatment of normal and estrogen‐deficient mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption.8In this study, we aimed to test the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss using the murine hindlimb unloading model. We hypothesized that mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment would inhibit the bone loss seen in disuse through increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption compared to vehicle‐treated hindlimb unloaded (HLU) counterparts."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDisuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMechanical loading plays an important role during musculoskeletal development and maintenance. Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures. Biological mechanisms underlying skeletal deterioration due to reduced mechanical loading have been studied using hindlimb unloading rodent models, which demonstrated altered Wnt or IGF signaling or Rank/Rankl/Opg pathway [1–5]. These studies led to several clinical studies that explored the usage of existing or newly developed pharmacological therapies to counter immobilization or spaceflight induced bone loss [6,7].While prior studies in rodent models demonstrated signaling pathways that contribute to skeletal loss from reduced mechanical loading, limited candidate gene approached precluded exploration of other novel pathways that may also play an important role. Recent advances in whole transcriptome RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) allow comprehensive, quantitative, and unbiased view of the complete RNA transcriptome. This high-throughput approach can allow identification novel pathways that are altered in response to reduced mechanical loading in rodent models. Prior studies in transgenic mice or mice that underwent increased mechanical loading successfully demonstrated alterations in novel pathways in osteocytes using RNAseq [8,9]. However, no studies to date examined whole transcriptome profile of osteocytes from mice that underwent reduced mechanical loading.Thus, we examined the complete RNA transcriptome in cortical bone from mice that underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days, with the goal of identifying novel mechanosensitive pathways that respond to mechanical unloading. We validated our RNAseq results by a highly sensitive RNA molecular barcoding technologies (NanoString) examining 60 panel genes."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction:\nIt may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR\n5-ion\n) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation.\nMethods:\nTo investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation.\nResults:\nDifferentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted\np\n-value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted\np\n-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR\n5-ion\nirradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis.\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR\n5-ion\nresults in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.\nKeywords:\ngalactic cosmic ray, cardiovascular degeneration, space radiation, proteomics, mass spectrometry, ionizing radiation, cardiovascular disease, phosphoproteomics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWe recently reported on long term functional changes to the heart following a single dose of GCR5-ion(Bishawi et al., 2022). Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta. Of the protein markers we evaluated (Fibulin-4, Fibulin-5, TGF-beta1, and EGFR), EGFR was the only marker that showed a statistically significant decrease in hearts from GCR-irradiated animals compared to age-matched sham irradiated controls (Bishawi et al., 2022).Other investigations have also examined the levels of individual cardiac protein markers in studies where rodents or rabbits were exposed to components of GCR (reviewed inDavis et al., 2021;Seawright et al., 2019;Amino et al., 2010;Soucy et al., 2011). These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. (Seawright et al., 2019) noted an increase in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and16O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or16O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15 Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 weeks out to 1 year after a single exposure (Amino et al., 2010). Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function.Soucy et al. examined xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the aortas of rats exposed to whole-body exposure of iron ion radiation (56Fe-ion) at doses of 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy (Soucy et al., 2011).In vivoaortic stiffness andex vivoaortic tension responses were measured 6 and 8 months after exposure as indicators of chronic vascular injury. Rats exposed to 1 Gy56Fe-ion demonstrated significantly increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. XO activity was significantly elevated in rat aorta 4 months after whole-body irradiation.Recently, Azimzadeh et al. published a comprehensive review of the available omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multi-omics) of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease focusing on gamma and X-ray exposure (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). Across 27 published proteomics data sets, mitochondrial proteins were the most sensitive protein cluster affected in irradiated hearts across different types and doses of radiation, with many of these mitochondrial proteins being significantly downregulated. In addition, long term downregulation of many anti-oxidant defense proteins was observed in many publication examining mouse models as well as validated in studies of heart autopsies obtained from workers in the nuclear industry.While recentlyLaiakis et al (2022)have utilized label-free mass spectrometry untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling to characterize the proteome of the prefrontal cortex in rats exposed to28Si ions, there have been no corresponding studies undertaken to understand the global proteomic changes occurring in the heart following exposure to components of space radiation. As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR5-ion. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR5-ionand suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail\nHelix lucorum\nexposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.\nKeywords:\nmollusks, gravity sensing, statocyst, neuroplasticity, vestibular system, gravitaxis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionVertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle,2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity.The mechanoreceptors provide the neural code to the reflex mechanisms that control balance and equilibrium and restore the organism to its appropriate posture and orientation. The first vertebrate ear was in essence a graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann,1988), and only later in evolution did angular acceleration sensation appear as the animal increased its locomotor mobility and developed a flexible neck (Straka et al.,2014).In vertebrates the vestibular-induced compensatory action is both tonic and dynamic and distributed mainly to the motor circuits controlling the extensor, or antigravity, muscles (Wilson and Jones,1979). In the absence of gravity and thus an opposing force, even as brief as 5–11 days, astronauts lose about 20% muscle mass (Fitts et al.,2001; Demontis et al.,2017). The changes observed on the skeletomotor system by spaceflight are largely predicted by the mechanical unloading of the body mass: a large skeletal frame to manage muscle contractions about joints is no longer needed and muscle atrophy and osteopenia occur. This same causality might predict a comparable deterioration of vestibular mechanosensory function by space flight: no signal and thus no gain in the system. Surprisingly, despite the permanence of gravity during the evolutionary courses of vertebrates and invertebrates in an otherwise changing environment, the mechanosensory structures do not progressively degenerate, at least not in the short term. Extraordinarily challenging recordings taken during spaceflight from bullfrog otolith afferents by Bracchi et al. (1975) and Gualtierotti (1977) and vestibular neurons and ocular gaze in alert monkeys by Kozlovskaya and her colleagues (reviewed in Cohen et al.,2005) were interpreted as showing an increased sensitivity in measured responses, at least in the early periods of the missions. Otolith afferents in the teleost toadfish exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to inertial accelerations upon return to Earth which recovered back to normal after several days (Boyle et al.,2001). A more recent study in astronauts exposed to long-term space missions aboard the International Space Station have shown a deceased otolith-mediated responses elicited by centrifugation after 6 months of spaceflight which also fully recovered within ~9 days after return (Hallgren et al.,2016). The results in vertebrates exposed to space missions indicate the importance of the duration of exposure to space and the time frame in which measures are taken.On Earth the orientation of the gravitational acceleration defines the vertical, and although the gravitational vertical is lost in space, the astronaut uses other cues, such as vision to perceive an “up” orientation (Clément et al.,2007). The land snailHelix lucorumLinnaeus (Pulmonata, Gastropoda) also orients to the vertical using its bilateral statocysts and visual receptors, and can actually move against the force of gravity using a sticky excretion. We selected the land snail for a month-long study on an unmanned orbiting satellite for many reasons, such as their small size permitting a sufficient sample size given our volume limit, snails are hardy and can remain metabolically active under confined conditions for the duration of the mission, snails do not require elaborate life support systems, recordings can be made directly from the sensory receptors themselves (Balaban et al.,2011; Popova and Boyle,2015), and importantly certain snail behaviors and their underlying cellular circuits are well described (Balaban,2002). In the present study snails spent 30 days under conditions of weightlessness and darkness, thereby removing its normal cues of the vertical. Under return to Earth the postflight snails were compared to four separate control groups to identify the adaptive changes at the behavioral, structural, molecular, and neurophysiological levels. Based on the present results we also recalculated our previous Foton-M3 data to confirm the findings in separate missions and establish a time course of response readaptation or recovery of function after a spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.\nKeywords:\nVestibular, hair cell, afferent, macula, biocytin, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, RRID:AB_2336827 Vector Lab, RRID:SCR_014199 Adobe® Photoshop®, RRID:SCR_001775 Neurolucida",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionVertebrates possess a highly conserved and elaborate gravito-inertial sensing system in the inner ear. This system comprises two otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, in mammals with the exception of monotremes. A third otolith organ, the lagena, is present in fishes but absent in marsupials and eutherian mammals. Comparative data link the first sensory detectors of the ear primarily to a grouping of hair cells within a simple graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann, 1988) from which the vertebrate inner ear probably evolved (Fritsch et al., 2007). Structurally, the otolith organs consist of layers of neural and non-neural elements. Supporting cells and ciliated hair cells populate the neurosensory epithelium, the “spot” or macula; and the kino- and stereocilia of bundles extending from the apical surface of hair cells are covered with the non-neural gelatinous and fibrousotolith membranelayers (Lim, 1973;Lins et al., 2000;Sokolowski, 1986). Attached to this dense filament matrix are the weight-lending otoconia (grains) or a singular otolith (stone) in fishes. The loose aggregate of the otoconial mass of sharks and rays appears to present a transition to the rigid polycrystalline otolith found in teleosts (Gauldie, 1996). Otoconia are biomineral crystalline deposits of calcium carbonate organized in a calcite lattice in birds and mammals; aragonite is the predominant polymorph in fishes, amphibians and reptiles (Wang et al., 1998).The utricle lies primarily in the horizontal plane and senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation in the forward-backward and left-right directions (or any combination therein) and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. When the head rapidly moves, inertia causes the otolith mass to “lag” behind the sensory epithelium and this force is transmitted to the stereocilia bundle by way of lateral cross-links between the apex of the kinocilium and otolith membrane (Eatock et al., 1987). For slow movement (tilt), the heavier otolith follows the force vector of gravity. Hair cells are directional mechanosensors, and the resulting bending of their hair bundles begins the transduction cascade that transforms the vector sum of the imposing accelerations into a neural code (Hudspeth & Corey, 1977). The hair cell polarities (Flock, 1964;Maklad et al., 2010) and their coordinated distribution (Sienknecht et al., 2014) on the utricular epithelium ensure that all movements in the horizontal plane are adequately sensed, and the vector of stimulation by particle motion in both the horizontal and vertical planes is encoded by the range of hair cell orientations on the saccule of the toadfish (Edds-Walton & Fay, 2002).In humans, primary afferents innervating the otolith organs carry their constructed vector code in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. There it is combined with angular motion signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with sensory cues derived from the visual, proprioceptive, tactile, cognitive and visceral systems to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. This representation is called the gravito-inertial vector (seeMerfeld et al., 1999) and is an important transformation that the brain constructs to resolve the ambiguity of gravity and self-motion and thereby maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions in healthy individuals. The utricle can be adversely affected by trauma and disease and is directly implicated in space motion sickness and disorientation during space missions (Reschke et al. 1994) and readaptation upon return to Earth’s 1g (Boyle et al., 2001).The structural organization of the sensory epithelia and the otoliths have been studied in species of fishes (Dale, 1976;Flock, 1964;Hama, 1969;Popper, 1976,1977,1978;Platt, 1977, 1983;Dunkelberger et al., 1980;Jenkins, 1981;Chang et al., 1992;Lu & Popper, 1998;Platt et al., 2004;Popper & Lu, 2000;Buran et al., 2005;Lovell et al., 2006;Schulz-Mirbach et al., 2011), including toadfish (Sokolowski & Popper, 1987,1988), and also in amphibians (Kachar et al., 1990;Kurc et al., 1999), retiles (Xue & Peterson, 2006), birds (Si et al., 2003;Dickman et al., 2004;Zahir et al., 2012), and mammals (Lim, 1984;Yaku et al., 1989;Lins et al., 2000;Desai et al., 2005). The development and evolution of the inner ear sensory epithelia and their innervation patterns has been extensively investigated by Fritzsch and co-workers (Fritzsch et al., 2002,2007;Duncan & Fritzsch, 2012;Beisel et al., 2005) andStreit (2001;Lleras-Forero & Streit, 2012)and recently reviewed byManley et al. (2013)andFriedman & Giles, 2017), and provide insights into the molecular and structural commonality and diversity found in the animal phyla.The aim of the present study is to describe the structure of the utricle in the adult oyster toadfish,Opsanus tau, as a model vertebrate species. As noted bySokolowski & Popper (1988)the vestibular epithelium of adultOpsanusis not an oddity, but is similar in both gross and fine structure to that of many other fishes except the herring (Popper & Platt, 1979). The toadfish is noted for its survivability in harsh environments, such as extended exposure to cold climate or even stasis, its longevity (>40 years), its low food demands, and this vertebrate species’ neural response to altered gravity that likely mimics that of man (Boyle et al., 2001). Our knowledge of the consequences of long duration space on human health is inferential. We have no biological sample return of any vertebrate species exposed to deep space upon which to analyze, evaluate, model and predict the outcome of the mission. An essential goal here is to provide the framework of the inherent design of the hair cell and afferent organization schemes in this animal to serve as the morphological basis for concurrent and subsequent studies of the physiological responses of the otolith organ under normal and novel gravitational conditions."

        "Title": "Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nGravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish,\nOpsanus tau\n, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the\nsame\nfish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.\nKeywords:\nafferents, hair cells, acceleration, gravity, centrifugation, spaceflight, electrophysiology, serial electron microscopy reconstruction",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionGravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. Throughout the course of a species’ evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity’s continuous influence (Stensiö,1927;Friedman and Giles, 2017). Detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. The first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today’s aquatic invertebrates (Budelmann, 1988). Otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study (Boyle et al., 2001) fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents.Pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception. Otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum (seeGoldberg et al., 2012). There the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders.Arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. The established reference of self-orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation (Reschke et al., 1994;Demontis et al., 2017) linked to the otolith organs (Watt et al., 1986;Paloski et al., 1993;Heer and Paloski, 2006). An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard Shuttle orbiters (Boyle et al., 2001). The hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al., 1994).Physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. What initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? In addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound (Warr and Guinan, 1979;Liberman, 1980;Groff and Liberman, 2003). In functional terms, this efferent-to-afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way (Brown et al., 1983;Russell and Murugasu, 1997). Analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents (Smith and Rasmussen, 1968;Sans and Highstein, 1984;Holstein et al., 2004;Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008), and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish (Flock and Russell, 1976;Hartmann and Klinke, 1980;Boyle and Highstein, 1990b;Boyle et al., 2009), frog (Gribenski and Caston, 1976;Valli et al., 1986;Chagnaud et al., 2015), turtle (Brichta and Goldberg, 2000;Holt et al., 2006), bird (Dickman and Correia, 1992), chinchilla (Marlinski et al., 2004), and primates (Goldberg and Fernández, 1980;Sadeghi et al., 2009). Reflex or self-generated movements often have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape) behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement, and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during execution of those behaviors. To enable the afferent to continuously encode motion profiles during such overt behaviors its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically, but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is registered by the efferent system and participates in adaptive processes.Another possible participant in adaptive processes in the peripheral labyrinth is a rapid addition or removal of synaptic bodies associated with the hair cell-afferent synapse.Ross (2000)found the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased two to threefold following 14-day exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier afferent data (Boyle et al., 2001) was an increase in synaptic strength as an initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies (Waites et al., 2005;Matthews and Fuchs, 2010;Graydon et al., 2017) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity (HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in thesameanimal."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nXyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating\nmur3\nmutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating\nmur3\nmutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the\nXYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2\n(\nXLT2\n) gene. Normal growth was restored in the\nmur3-3\nmutant overexpressing\nXLT2\nand in\nmur3-3 xxt\ndouble mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates in UPR signaling (Box 1). Although PERK-like activity has been detected is plants [3], plant PERK-like proteins have not been identified yet (Box 1).Box 1. Multicellular UPR signaling strategy in multicellular eukaryotes.Membrane-tethered bZIP TFsIn response to ER stress in metazoans, the ER membrane-tethered activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) moves to the Golgi where the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) release the TF domain from the membrane anchor. This process is followed by nuclear translocation of the TF domain to modulate gene transcription. The Arabidopsis genome encodes functional homologs of ATF6: AtbZIP28 [44,45] and AtbZIP17 [40]. Functional equivalent TFs have been reported in other plant species [7,46]. The mechanisms of activation of AtbZIP28 are similar to those of ATF6 with COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi translocation [47] and subsequent activation through proteolysis at the Golgi by S1P [48] and S2P [38], which recognize cleavage sites in the lumenal face and in the transmembrane domain of AtbZIP28, respectively [47,48]. Activation of AtbZIP17 relies on S2P [38], but reliance on S1P is yet unknown.PERKIn metazoans, the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) attenuates general translation but favors selective translation of the ATF4 TF through selective phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor eIF2α [2,49]. In plants a functional homologue of PERK has not been identified yet, despite the evidence that a PERK-like phosphorylation of transcription initiation factors (eIF) occurs in ER stress. AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation occurs in a loss-of-function mutant background of the Arabidopsis SPIKE1 (SPK1), a DOCK family GEF involved in cell morphogenesis [3,50]. Intriguingly,spk1has constitutively elevated expression levels of UPR target genes, and shows hypersensitivity to tunicamycin [3]. The evidence that simultaneous loss of AtIRE1 and AtbZIP28 is lethal at embryonic level [18] supports that if PERK-like proteins were involved in the UPR in plant cells, they would likely function in specific stress situations. Yet it cannot be excluded that the kinase activity of AtIRE1, which has been experimentally validated [18], may be responsible for the observed AteIF2α hyper-phosphorylation.Figure 1.Open in a new tabPhylogenetic analysis of IRE1-like proteins andAtbZIP60-like transcripts from different plant species, yeast and human.(a)Phylogenic tree analysis of IRE1-like proteins from Plantae (eudicots and monocots), Metazoa (Homo sapiens) and Fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was generated with MEGA6 program with 1000 replicates in the bootstrap test [51] using the neighbor-joining method [52].

TheAtbZIP60-like transcripts were collected from NCBI database. Branch length is not to scale.How the sensors input stress to modulate an effective output in life-or-death decisions is largely unknown, especially in plants. Here we discuss plant UPR strategies that recent exciting results have brought to light in support of convergence of signaling strategies among multicellular eukaryotes as well as plant-specific features of the UPR.Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: activation of a transcription factorPlants encode one or more IRE1 isoforms (Figure 1a). IRE1-mediated splicing of a transcription factor (TF) mRNA is a conserved strategy for UPR gene regulation (Figure 2). Among eukaryotes the IRE1-TF targets are members of the large bZIP-TF family: Hac1 in yeast and Xbp1 in metazoans. In flowering plants,AtbZIP60, Osb-ZIP74/50andZmbZIP60are the targets identified inArabidopsis thaliana(dicot),Oryza sativaandZea mays(monocots), respectively [4–9] (Figure 1b). The consensus mRNA structure that is recognized by IRE1 (i.e. twin-stem loops with conserved bases in each loop) is largely conserved across eukaryotes. The excised intron sequence is slightly different among monocots but conserved in dicots [8]. However, there are noticeable differences in the splicing output among eukaryotes. In plants, the IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing causes an intron-excising frameshift that occurs closely upstream of the region encoding a putative transmembrane domain and leads to elimination of the membrane anchor in the translated active TF [4,7,8]. In metazoans, the IRE1-spliced Xbp1 loses the ER membrane anchor and gains the TF domain located in the new C-terminal tail [10,11]. In yeast, the splicing of Hac1 mRNA is followed by transcriptional joint of the DNA-binding domain to the newly encoded TF transcription activation domain [12]. The lack of a close conservation of the sequence of the mature TFs and the diversification of the splicing outputs among eukaryotes support that, despite IRE1 being an ancient sensor, IRE1-TF targets may have evolved independently. Under this light, the notion that Hac1 and Xbp1 are the sole direct TF targets of IRE1 may not apply in plants where IRE1 may have other direct TF targets that may fine-tune IRE1 signaling in the UPR management in specific stress situations. This possibility is predicated by the evidence that even in the simultaneous absence of the Arabidopsis ER-stress activated TFs (AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60), one of the major UPR gene markers, AtBiP3 is mildly induced in conditions of ER stress [13••].Figure 2.Open in a new tabPlayers of the plant UPR known to date. The diagram illustrates that in addition to IRE1, bZIP28 and bZIP60, also bZIP17 plays a role in the control of UPR target genes in Arabidopsis, as recently proposed [27]. A role for the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, AGB1, in modulating the UPR has also been reported [17••,53]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that NAC TFs participate to the plant UPR. NAC are plant-specific transcription factors, among which at least 13 members are predicted to be membrane-anchored in Arabidopsis. In condition of stress, the plasma membrane NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6 relocates to the nucleus, and the overexpression of a protein deletion devoid of the membrane anchor leads to activation of UPR genes [54••]. Another membrane-anchored NAC TF, NAC089, participates to ER stress responses by relocating from the ER to the nucleus and regulating PCD-related gene expression [55•].NAC089expression is regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60; bZIP60 also regulates directly the expression ofNAC062. Finally the cytosolic NAC103, whose expression is directly regulated by bZIP60, is involved in controlling UPR gene expression [26•]. The evidence that plant-specific NAC TFs have a role in stress responses support that in addition to common routes plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress defense that, as in the case of NAC062, may also depend on the activity of TFs that are localized to the membrane organelles other than the ER. Interestingly also, it has been recently suggested that unspliced AtbZIP60 may have a role in modulating the expression ofBiP3in conditions of ER stress [27]. Phosphorylation of the elf2α may occur in a hypothetical PERK-like pathway for ER stress responses. See also the main text for additional details. TFD: transcription factor domainDiversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: RIDDIn addition to TF-mRNA splicing, metazoan IRE1 degrades mRNAs through a site-specific cleavage process, known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) [14], which is uncoupled from the site-specific splicing activity of IRE1 [15]. RIDD activity is required for ER homeostasis in non ER-stress conditions and increases progressively with ER-stress intensity. RIDD also occurs in Arabidopsis [16••], but its physiological relevance without ER-stress induction is yet to be defined [16••]. In normal conditions of growth, loss of AtIRE1 function causes defects in root elongation [17••], independently of Atb-ZIP60 [18••]. It is possible therefore that in the absence of induced ER stress RIDD may be important to maintain growth homeostasis in specific plant organs by controlling the levels of mRNA of proteins involved in cell growth.Diversification of IRE1 signaling in the UPR: miRNA cleavageIn mammalian cells, IRE1 also cleaves sequences of specific miRNAs [19]. miRNAs operate to translationally repress gene expression [20]. Whether plant IRE1 has a similar control of miRNA levels is yet unknown. Selective miRNA cleavage could be a strategy to either overcome stress, modulate tissue growth, or both. Addressing this question may lead to new insights into the functions of plant IRE1, and to establishing whether IRE1 activity is conserved among eukaryotes. Indeed the findings that loss of IRE1 is lethal in conditions of prolonged ER stress support a function as ER-stress protector [17••]. The recent evidence that the mammalian IRE1 may not activate caspases to induce cell death in prolonged ER stress, contrarily to a previous notion [19], but rather delay the onset of apoptosis via decay of the pro-apoptotic Death Receptor 5 (DR5) [21], poses that plant and animal IRE1s may be functionally close in protecting the organism from death.How may multiple IRE1 help plants in stress defense?An intriguing question relates to the diversification of the ER-stress sensors in plants both qualitatively and quantitatively. In Arabidopsis there are two IRE1 isoforms, AtIRE1a and AtIRE1b [22]. Whether IRE1 isoforms may be functionally equivalent is a matter of debate. Both genes are expressed throughout the plant, but AtIRE1a is more abundant in embryos and seeds [22,23]. It has been proposed that unlikely AtIRE1a, AtIRE1b is relevant toAtbZIP60splicing in conditions of DTT-induced stress [4], supporting the possibility of functional diversification of AtIRE1 proteins. This is further reinforced by the observations that while AtIRE1b has a preponderant role inAtbZIP60splicing upon tunicamycin-induced ER-stress, AtIRE1a seems preferentially required forAtbZIP60splicing upon pathogen and salicylic acid (SA) infection [5]. Although functional diversification of the SA response has been recently questioned [24], the evidence that AtIRE1b but not AtIRE1a is required forAtbZIP60splicing [4] supports that AtIRE1 proteins may have undergone functional specialization. These observations raise the question how the multiple IRE1-functions may be executed in species with one IRE1 isoform. The observation that in Arabidopsis AtIRE1b but not AtbZIP60 is required for ER stress-induced autophagy [25••] hints to the possibility that, in species containing only one IRE1 gene, some of the IRE1-roles may be executed by other proteins. Nonetheless the evidence in Arabidopsis that in induced-stress conditions, unlike a doubleatire1a/atire1bmutant, single IRE1 loss-of-function mutants survive prolonged ER stress supports that at least the pro-survival role of AtIRE1 is shared by the two proteins. Whether the roles of the IRE1 isoforms are spatially and/or temporally regulated is yet to be established. It is possible that in certain tissues IRE1 may have a specific relevance and other ER stress sensors might operate predominately in other tissues.How may multiple bZIPs help plants in stress defense?Loss of either AtbZIP60 or AtbZIP28 (Box 1) attenuates the expression of some common transcriptional targets such as BiP3 and calnexin, an effect that is additive when both genes are simultaneously deleted [26•]. This evidence supports overlapping functions of these two TFs for which a precise extent of overlap is yet to be completely understood both at a temporal resolution as well as target identity. Specifically, it is yet to be defined whether at the onset of ER stress, activation of AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 occurs simultaneously or sequentially. One may predict that mild stress might be resolved by the function of one of the two TFs and that the activation of the other TF may be actuated in situations of unresolved ER stress to potentiate an ER stress-mitigating response. It is also known however that activation of bZIP-TFs may lead to responses that are qualitatively distinct. For example, in conditions of salt stress, AtbZIP17 modulates only the expression ofBiP3among the known ER stress markers [27], which, on the other hand, is controlled by both AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 in conditions of ER stress induced by heat or by drugs such as tunicamycin and DTT. Furthermore, heat, tunicamycin and DTT but not salt stress can induce activation of AtbZIP60 and AtbZIP28, and a role of AtIRE1-AtbZIP60 but not AtbZIP28 has been demonstrated in virus-plant interactions [28]. These findings support that plant stress response relies on functional specialization of the UPR effectors for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this view the UPR sensors might be specialized in perceiving specific classes of unfolded proteins, which may be more sensitive than others to specific stresses.Requirements for the UPR sensorsIn yeast and metazoans, a model has emerged that the binding of unfolded proteins to IRE1 dimers allows further oligomerization and trigger the IRE1 activation, while the BiP binding to IRE1 may have a modulatory role in buffering the pool of IRE1 monomers [2,29]. In plants the mechanisms of activation of IRE1 are largely unknown. Nonetheless, binding to AtBiP is a mechanism that constrains AtbZIP28 to the ER and therefore modulates AtbZIP28 traffic to the Golgi for activation [30]. Such a mechanism, which is similar to the activation mechanism of ATF6 [31] could suggest also conservation of IRE1 activation. Similarly, AtbZIP17 may be retained in the ER via interactions with other proteins that specifically respond to salt stress. One alternative that cannot be excluded is that one branch of the UPR may be activated as consequence to the operation of another ER-stress response, such as production of radicals or unfolded proteins, which could lead to the activation of other ER stress defenses.Interaction with unfolded proteins might not be the only upstream requirement for plant IRE1 activation. Functional and genetic evidence have shown that the ER-shaping protein AtRHD3 is a critical factor that acts upstream of AtIRE1 in theAtbZIP60splicing in conditions of ER stress [32•], but the underlying causes are not known. In conditions of ER stress yeast and metazoan IRE1s are known to cluster in ER subdomains where stress signaling is believed to occur [2]. In the absence of induced ER stress, fluorescent protein fusions to plant IRE1s have been localized to the perinuclear ER [22]. It is possible that, if plant IRE1 is also mobilized into signaling clusters in ER-stress conditions, then alteration of the ER network structure or lipid composition, known to occur with RHD3 deletions [33,34], may affect mobilization of plant IRE1 into signaling hubs.Besides factors acting upstream the UPR sensors in plants, we know very little about downstream regulating factors. Unlike metazoan IRE1, which is known to interact with multiple proteins which may or may not regulate its function [35], the identity of plant IRE1-interacting proteins is still unknown. The situation is markedly different for the bZIP-TFs.In vitroAtbZIP28 can homodimerize but also heterodimerize with AtbZIP60, Atb-ZIP49 or AtbZIP17 [36]. Validation of these findingsin vivocoupled with functional analyses may provide insights into the relevance of the TF interactions in the UPR. AtbZIP28 has also been found to interact with NF-Y subunits to form a transcriptional complex that upregulates the expression of ER stress-induced genes [36]. Furthermore, AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP60 interact with AtAsh2 and AtWDR5a, which are core components of the COMPASS-like complex that regulates gene expression through histone H3K4 trimethylation [13••]. These findings support that the protein-protein interactions of the UPR bZIP-TFs may have important roles in the regulation of gene expression and that a diversification of such interactions may be needed to modulate responsive outputs that are different both at quantitative and qualitative levels. One critical yet unanswered question is how the activated sensors are restored to basal levels once the ER stress is resolved. In other words, how is the plant UPR tamed once ER homeostasis is obtained?"

        "Title": "Vesicles versus Tubes: Is Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi Transport in Plants Fundamentally Different from Other Eukaryotes?",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPhotosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of\ncotton Golgi-related\n(\nCGR\n)\n2\nor\n3\ngenes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing\nCGR2\n(CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both\nCGR\n-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO\n2\ndiffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the\nCGR\n-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however,\nCGR\n-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nEukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in\nArabidopsis thaliana\n, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other\nArabidopsis\ngenes of unknown function and to\nFRIENDLY\n, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in\nArabidopsis\n. In contrast to\nFRIENDLY\n, these three homologs of\nFRIENDLY\nare found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that\nFRIENDLY\nexpanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as\nREDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE\n(\nREC\n). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in\nrec1\nmutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to secretory pathway (Vitale and Denecke 1999), the primary site of phospholipid synthesis (Ohlrogge and Browse 1995), a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules (Lightet al.2016,Ron and Walter 2007,Shoreet al.2011), and the assembly plant for a third of a cell's total proteome (Wallin and Heijne 1998), interruptions in its functions can have vast consequences in cellular health. Under physiological conditions of growth, a dedicated battery of ER-resident proteins can prevent misfolding of nascent polypeptides and facilitate acquisition of the proper tertiary structure through post-translational modification (e.g., covalent addition of oligosaccharide chains or catalysis of disulfide bond formation) (Dobson 2003,Gupta and Tuteja 2011). In plants affected by environmental stress (e.g. heat stress (Gidalevitzet al.2011)), proper folding of secretory proteins can be impaired and misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress (Dobson 2003,Hartl and Haver-Hartl 2009,Buchbergeret al2010). Indeed, under prolonged or severe levels of stress, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins can become cytotoxic and lead to death of the plant cell in a manner akin to the effect of misfolded proteins that aggregate and cause human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hoozemanset al.2005). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms designed to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Specialized ER-localized membrane proteins are able to detect the buildup of unfolded proteins and activate signaling cascades that modulate the abundance of the proteins dedicated to the folding of nascent polypeptides within the ER to maintain homeostasis (Ron and Walter 2007,Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014,Rubertiet al.2015). In metazoans the ER-localized stress sensor array consists of the Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and Protein kinase R-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) (Hardinget al.1999,Shenet al.2002,Wanget al.1998). In plants, the functional homologs of IRE1 and ATF6 (termed IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 inArabidopsis thaliana)have been identified to date (Iwata and Koizumi 2012). In yeast, only the IRE1-dependent UPR pathway has been identified (Ron and Walter 2007,Mori 2009). A number of comparative reviews have highlighted the similarities between UPR components shared among plants, metazoans and yeast, and should be referred to for greater contexts on the depth of gene conservation shared by all eukaryotes in regards to UPR-related mechanisms (Chen and Brandizzi 2013,Liu and Howell 2016,Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014,Rubertiet al. 2015).The study of the UPR in human and animal models largely centers on genetic defects that allow the buildup of misfolded proteins, and mitigating the cytotoxic effects of the resulting aggregates (Rao and Bredesen 2004,Stefani and Dobson 2003). In plants, UPR research also focuses on improving crop yield under adverse environmental conditions. There is a large potential for biotechnological applications for UPR-related mechanisms in ensuring plant productivity. However, considerable work must be done to understand how the UPR is integrated into intra and intercellular signaling mechanisms that are plant specific. Even though there is considerable evidence to suggest that the UPR components are required for many different aspects of plant physiology, from seed germination to meristematic maintenance (Barba-Espínet al.2014,Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Chenet al.2014,Denget al.2013,Kleinet al.2006,Denget al.2016,Menget al.2016), we are only beginning to connect the molecular activities of IRE1 and bZIP28 to the modulation of organism growth and development.In this review, we provide a summary of causative ER stress conditions followed by an examination of UPR signaling pathways through a discussion of recent advancements in the field. Given space constraints, this review focuses mainly on UPR studies in the model dicotArabidopsis thaliana.Throughout, we draw attention of the reader to new developments in the context of plant growth, development, and metabolic functioning. This is done in an attempt to move beyond a classical linear signal transduction paradigm, and visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life.ER Quality Control and Important ER Client Proteins Mediate both Programmed Cell Death and Cell Cycle ControlIf the plant cell was reimagined as a city, it would be easy to see how the ER could be described as the town's central factory. At the ER, shipments of raw materials in the form of amino acids and carbohydrates are reshaped and assembled into fully-functional molecular machines in the form of proteins. Properly folded proteins are then shipped out and utilized for a variety of different purposes in different places throughout or outside the cell. In order to prevent the production of faulty goods, the ER has specific machinery, collectively called ER quality control (ERQC), to survey the protein folding status, facilitate folding and ensure quality of the produced protein. The production of most secretory proteins begins with the co-translational introduction of the protein into the ER. In this process, specific peptide sequences target nascent polypeptide chains to the ER and are translocated across the membrane as they are synthesized via the Sec translocon, which is largely conserved between yeast and plants (Akopianet al.2013,Deneckeet al.1992,Denekeet al.1993,Schweiger and Schenkert 2013). As the polypeptide enters the ER lumen, molecular chaperones such as the luminal binding proteins (BiPs), bind to the chain of the nascent polypeptides and prevent premature folding (Carvalhoet al.2014,Forestiet al.2003). The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Lerouxelet al.2005) recognizes specific amino acid sequences and transfersN-linked glycans to the peptides. In some cases, this post translational modification adds to the intrinsic stability or solubility of a protein, and importantly, it functions as a recognition beacon for major ER luminal foldase complexes (Sinclair and Elliott 2005). Nascent polypeptides undergo iterative folding cycles where they are passed between the calnexin/calreticulin complex, and UDP-glucose glycoprotein-glucosyltransferase (UGGT), which monitor protein folding and retains unfolded proteins in the ER (Totaniet al., 2009) as a part of the ERQC. Other proteins participate in folding cycles under the purview of these central ER foldase complexes, such as thioredoxins (e.g protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs)), which catalyze the reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds (Bottomleyet al.2001,Wilkinson and Gilbert 2004). Properly folded proteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, while the unfolded or irremediably misfolded proteins are picked up by proteins like OS9 of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, dislocated out of the ER, ubiquitinated, and finally degraded by the 26S proteasome (Huttneret al.2012). The process is conserved across eukaryotes and, for example, it mediates the proper folding of critical client plasma membrane receptor proteins in plants, including the Arabidopsis elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor which mediates pathogen associated molecular pattern based immunity (Liet al.2009) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) receptor (Li and Chory 1997).Although not directly related to the activation of the UPR, the essential physiological relevance of these folding processes, which are monitored by the UPR regulators (via unfolded protein accumulation), are continuously being demonstrated. Beyond enabling proper function of cellular signaling pathways with receptors at the plasma membrane (like EF-Tu and BRI1), the specificity ofN-linked glycosylation-bearing proteins has recently been shown to play important roles in regulating cell death. The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) and SERK4 (somatic embryo receptor kinase 4) both interact with immune receptors and BRI1 and negatively regulate hypersensitive response-like programmed cell death (PCD) through yet-unknown mechanisms (Gouet al.2012,Liet al.2002,Nam and Li 2002,Rouxet al.2011). Intriguingly, loss of STT3a (staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3), one of the two catalytic subunits of the OST complex involved inN-glycosylation of ER proteins, is linked to the cell death phenotype observed inBAK1/SERK4silenced plants (de Oliveiraet al.2016). However, UPR deficient mutants did not respond differently toBAK1/SERK1silencing, which led to the conclusion that UPR regulators IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 may not modulate this specific type of PCD (de Oliveiraet al.2016).When examined under salt stress conditions, astt3aknockout line showed UPR activation and halted cell cycle progression in a similar manner to that described in yeast and mammalian cells after being subjected to ER stress-inducing conditions (Arnold and Tanner 1982,Breweret al.1999,Koiwaet al.2003). This may suggest a possible antagonistic role between STT3a and the UPR components, or may simply indicate that the proteins needed to adapt to salt stress may be glycosylated in order to fold or function properly. In both cases, although the UPR may not directly regulate the expression ofBAK1/SERK4orN-glycosylated salt protective genes, these examples underscore the importance of maintaining the ER as a fully-functional protein folding factory so a plant may adapt to various sources of stresses.The Causes of ER Stress: Unavoidable Exogenous ThreatsEnhancing the UPR appears potentially critical to efforts to maintain crop productivity by priming plants to survive under adverse environmental conditions (Valenteet al.2009,Carvalhoet al.2014,Luanet al.2016Xianget al.2016). One of the most thoroughly described environmental UPR inducer is heat stress (Denget al.2011,Duke and Doehlert 1996,Gaoet al.2008,Schmollingeret al.2013,Yanget al.2009). More conveniently than heat conditions in the lab, chemical UPR inducers such as tunicamycin, which inhibits theN-linked glycosylation in the ER lumen, are often used to investigate the UPR in many eukaryotic model organisms by mimicking the conditions associated with environmental stresses that cause the buildup of unfolded proteins. Extreme osmotic stress and heavy metals such as selenium have also shown to induce the UPR (Liuet al.2007,Van Hoewyk 2016). The UPR also plays a role in response to pathogens and other biotic stresses (Morenoet al.2012,Prasch and Sonnewald 2013,Zhanget al.2015). Through an unknown mechanism, treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the biotic stress-hormone salicylic acid (SA) was shown to activate both arms of the UPR controlled by IRE1 and bZIP28 (Morenoet al.2012,Nagashimaet al.2014). This SA-induced UPR activation was also given context byMenget al.(2016), which showed that the SA-accumulatingcpr5(Constitutive Expression of PR genes 5) mutant is dependent on the UPR to suppress growth. Other studies have demonstrated the interesting effect of organelle sourced reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. plastids and mitochondria) on the induction of the UPR (Ozguret al.2015) suggesting a possible functional connection between the UPR and non-secretory organelles. It was demonstrated that plastid-originated ROS production induced UPR activation suggesting that plastidial stress may be intimately linked with, and responded to, through the ER stress signal transduction mechanisms (Ozguret al.2015). Given the close connections between SA and ROS signaling (Torreset al.2006,Mouet al.2003), these observations may indicate a functional link between the two UPR activating conditions.The Canonical Response to Unfolded Proteins: New Look at the Master Regulators IRE1, bZIP60, and bZIP28IRE1In environmentally stressful conditions, the accumulation of unfolded and irremediably misfolded proteins leads to the activation of the UPR via IRE1 and bZIP28 (Figure 1). Although the activation mechanism of IRE1 has yet to be established in plants, studies of IRE1 in yeast have indicated that BiP binds the IRE1 luminal domain in non-stressful conditions. However, upon stress, BiP chaperones preferentially bind unfolded proteins thereby freeing the ER luminal domains of IRE1 (Pincuset al.2010). Unfolded proteins then bind to IRE1 (Gardner and Walter 2011) which oligomerizes; as a consequence, the kinase domain in the cytosolic portion of the protein is autophosphorylated (Shamu and Walter 1996,Welihinda and Kaufman 1996). These steps lead to activation of the IRE1 ribonuclease domain (Cox and Walter 1996). In mammalian cells misfolded proteins bind to BiP chaperones which keep IRE1 in an inactive monomeric state under normal conditions (Berlottiet al. 2000). After dissociation from BiP, interactions between the freed luminal domains of IRE1 bring cytoplasmic domains together allowing the necessary autophosphorylation (Credleet al. 2005,Aliet al.2011). Although the underlying mechanisms for activation of plant IRE1 are not known, it is certain that activation of IRE1 results in the unconventional cytosolic splicing of the mRNA transcripts ofbZIP60, the only UPR target of plant IRE1 known to date (Deng,et al.2011, Nagashimaet al. 2011, Hayashiet al. 2012, Luet al. 2012, Liet al. 2012Morenoet al.2012). In Arabidopsis, the tRNA ligase RLG1 was recently shown to complete the splicing ofbZIP60 in vitroby ligating the fragments derived from IRE1 cleavage (Nagashimaet al. 2016). Whether the ligation ofbZIP60spliced transcripts is mediated by RLG1in vivo, while likely, has yet to be experimentally demonstrated, partly due to the lethality of complete RLG1 loss-of-function mutations (Nagashimaet al.2016). In yeast and mammalian cells, the ligation of the functional equivalents ofbZIP60,Hac1andXbpI, respectively, occurs via tRNA ligases that operate in opposite fashion. In detail, the ligation ofHac1mediated by RLG1p in yeast is completed in a 5’-3’ fashion followed by removal of 2` phosphate group by a phosphatase (Sawayaet al.2003,Steigeret al.2005). In mammalian cells, the ligation is mediated by RTCB, which operates in a 3’-5’ ligation (Jurkinet al.2014). Evidence suggests that plants have evolved a 5’-3’ ligation mechanism similar to that found in yeast, and this finding is supported by observations that Arabidopsis RLG1 can also ligate theHac1mRNA in yeast cells (Moriet al.2010). However, the resultingHac1transcripts are not efficiently translated indicating that functional differences between yeast and Arabidopsis catalytic mechanisms remain. The splicing ofbZIP60leads to a frameshift that removes a transmembrane domain from the translated transcription factor. Spliced bZIP60 subsequently translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional modulation of the downstream UPR target genes. Intriguingly, the activity of IRE1 is not limited to unconventional splicing of a transcription factor. Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) is a process which regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. Such IRE1 mediated cleavage of cytosolic and ER-associated mRNAs has been implicated in promoting cell death in yeast (Tamet al.2014). In metazoans, RIDD activity under prolonged or severe ER stress also has proapoptotic effects, and can be associated with human diseases such as diabetes (Maurelet al. 2014,Hetz and Glimcher 2011). RIDD activity was also described for the Arabidopsis IRE1 homolog (Mishibaet al.2013), although the implications related to stress outcomes are yet to be testedin vivo.Figure 1. Mechanisms of the plant UPR activation.Open in a new tabEnvironmental stresses (e.g. heat, oxidative stress, selenium, chemical inhibitors) negatively affect the protein folding process, leading to the buildup of unfolded proteins. Plastid stress promotes the buildup of MEcPP (2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate), which through an unknown mechanism, activates CAMTA3 (Calmodulin biding transcriptional activator 3) inducing transcription ofbZIP60. 2. BiP ER luminal proteins bind unfolded proteins. The buildup of unfolded proteins leads to activation of IRE1 mediated splicing ofbZIP60, which is then potentially ligated by the RNA ligase RLG1. The splicedbZIP60is a nuclear localized transcription factor which binds to promoters of downstream UPR target genes, Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) although not depicted here, regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. 3. bZIP28 after being freed from BiPs by the presence of unfolded proteins is trafficked to the Golgi in a SAR1a/SEC23-dependent way. S2P proteases cleave the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain. bZIP28 enters the nucleus and acts redundantly with bZIP60 to transcriptionally activate the UPR.Evidence that plant IRE1 assumes other roles besides the splicing ofbZIP60, including RIDD and/or other yet-unknown activities of IRE1, can be found when comparing the stress responsive and vegetative phenotypic differences between IRE1 and bZIP60 loss-of-function mutants in Arabidopsis. Although no other direct splicing substrate has been found for IRE1 activity other thatbZIP60in plants,bzip60knockout mutants are not nearly as sensitive as theire1a/ire1bmutant to prolonged ER stress (Deng,et al.2013,Mishiba,et al.2013), implying diverse roles of IRE1 during the UPR. Whether these may depend on the ability of IRE1 to phosphorylate other substrates as opposed to its ribonuclease domain is a tantalizing idea that is yet to be experimentally tested. Furthermore,bzip60plants are apparently indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal conditions of growth, while IRE1 partial loss of function mutants (ire1a/ire1b) display shorter root growth as developmental defects, andire1null mutations are lethal (Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Denget al.2013,Lu and Christopher 2008). Comparative analyses betweenbzip60andire1a/ire1bmutants under stressed and unstressed conditions may yet yield information that could potentially explain these physiological differences and provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which tie IRE1 specifically to the control of plant health and cell fate decisions.bZIP60Although seemingly unimportant when compared with IRE1 or redundant when compared with other UPR signal transducers like bZIP28 (Sunet al.2013a) in conditions tested thus far, bZIP60 appears to have unique contributions to the UPR management. Indeed, a close examination of the ER molecular phenotypes associated withbzip60knockouts and expression patterns ofbZIP60yields some interesting information. The unspliced version ofbZIP60encodes a membrane bound transcription factor, and while it is found to be transcribed under normal conditions, the accumulation of the protein encoded by unsplicedbZIP60has been debated (Iwataet al.2008,Iwataet al.2009,Parra-Rojaset al.2015). Although methods of detection between studies have been different, it has been shown that the product of the unsplicedbZIP60isoform accumulates to higher levels in seedlings treated with a proteasome inhibitor compared to untreated seedlings (Parra-Rojaset al.2015). When this is taken into context with the observation that a cellular recycling process known as macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is constitutively active in thebzip60knockout (Liuet al.2012), it could be hypothesized that the dynamic levels of unspliced bZIP60 products are post-translationally subject to selective protein degradation and may regulate aspects of ER homeostasis, including protection of the ER against autophagy.bZIP60has also been shown to be transcriptionally regulated in conditions outside of the canonical UPR as well. In chloroplasts, reductive potential is funneled into carbon fixation and the synthesis of long carbon chains through the plastid isoprenoid metabolic pathway, collectively known as the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014). This biosynthetic track produces numerous molecular-end products, which range in function from growth and development (e.g., gibberellin precursors) to synthesis of isoprene gas, which protects chloroplast under heat stress (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014,Hedden and Thomas 2012,Sharkey 2005). Retrograde stress signaling mechanisms from chloroplasts to nucleus utilize the buildup of the MEP pathway intermediate methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) in an abiotic stress dependent manner (Xiaoet al.2012). The CEH1 (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl4-diphosphate synthase) enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of MEcPP to hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate (HMBPP) is dependent upon reductive potential of NADPH from the light reactions and, as a result, the activity of CEH1 is known to be oxidative stress sensitive (Ostrovskyet al.1998). Fascinatingly, the MEcPP retrograde signal, transmitted in a calcium-dependent way via the calmodulin binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3), leads directly to transcriptional induction ofbZIP60(Bennet al.2016). The possibility that the UPR responds to plastid metabolic dysfunction may also indicate that, like in humans (Ron and Walter 2007), the UPR may have tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming functions that have gone unnoticed in plants. This intracellular organelle bridge deserves further scrutiny, and its connection to the observations made byOzguret al. (2015)in their study of UPR activation under oxidative stress cannot be understated. When sourced from different organelles, ROS had highly variable effects in stimulating expression of some UPR genes while repressing others (e.g. methyl viologen inducesBiP3expression but heavily repressedBiP2expression). AlthoughbZIP60expression and splicing have yet to be tracked under these conditions, this information could help identify mechanisms for selective upregulation or downregulation of UPR genes. This is especially valuable given that current studies of the two arms of the plant UPR are most often considered in the context of coordinated upregulation of UPR genes (Nagashimaet al.2014).bZIP28The ER transmembrane transcription factor bZIP28 is released from binding to BiP chaperones and is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus where putative site 1 and site 2 protease (S1P and S2P)-mediated proteolytic mechanisms split the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain and allow its relocation to the nucleus (Gaoet al.2008,Liuet al.2007,Srivastavaet al.2013, Liuet al.2013,Sunet al.2013c,Sunet al.2015). Once in the nucleus the activated bZIP28 forms protein complexes with NF-Y transcription factors, and together bind specific ER stress related cis-elements (ERSE), which consist of two consensus sequences separated by 10 nucleotides (CCAAT-N10-CACG) and are commonly found in UPR upregulated gene promoter regions (Liuet al.2010).Looking beyond the functions of bZIP28 in the nucleus, recent work has elucidated the mechanisms by which bZIP28 is shuttled to the Golgi apparatus in an ER stress dependent fashion. In exploring the functional diversity of the COPII components involved in ER export,Zenget al. (2015)mapped the biochemical interactions necessary for proper transfer of bZIP28 to the Golgi apparatus under ER stress. ER-to-Golgi transport is mediated by a specialized protein machinery collectively known COPII (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2014). Assembly of this machinery requires SAR1, a GTPase that in the active form recruits the COPII coat components, SEC23/Sec24 and SEC13/SEC31. These components are required for cargo selection at the ER and shuttling to the Golgi. Although SAR1a shares high sequence identity to other secretion associated RAS-related GTPase homologs of the SAR1-family in Arabidopsis (Hantonet al.2008), a single cysteine residue substitution at the amino acid position 84 was found to be required for interaction with SEC23a (Zenget al. 2015). A dominant negative allele of SAR1a impaired the export of bZIP28 from the ER to the Golgi under tunicamycin-induced stress in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In contrast with other SAR1 and SEC23 homologs in Arabidopsis, the SAR1a/SEC23a pair is transcriptionally induced under ER stress conditions (Songet al. 2013). As such they may play an important role in promoting and sustaining the activity of bZIP28 during ER stress. This also opens up avenues to explore other conditions which could promote condition-specific trafficking of bZIP28, and subsequently potential activation of bZIP28 in developmental or growth contexts without activation of the canonical UPR cascade. This may be especially impactful with respect to bZIP28 functions in promoting brassinosteroid (BR) sensitivity (Cheet al.2010). S1P-S2P mediated cleavage of bZIP28 and another bZIP-transcription factor (bZIP17) under ER stress promote active BR signaling in adaptation to abiotic stress responses (Cheet al.2010). Although this phenomenon is presumed to be result of ERQC upregulation and increased delivery of functional client protein BRI1 sensor to the cell surface (Gendron and Wang 2007,Jinet al.2007,Honget al.2008,Jinet al.2009,Cheet al.2010), the exact mechanism through which bZIP28 and bZIP17 positively impact BR signaling remains to be discovered.Future Exploration: bZIP60 and bZIP28 mediate Epigenetic Modifications with the COMPASS like ComplexIn contrast with the singlebzip60andbzip28mutants, thebzip60 bzip28double mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to prolonged ER stress (Denget al.2013), indicating both functional redundancy and potential cooperativity. Under ER stress conditions both bZIP60 and bZIP28 localize to the nucleus and have been shown to interact with each other to modulate the expression of UPR genes (Songet al.2015). The recent findings implicating bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the direction of histone methylation activities of the COMPASS complex presents interesting opportunities for further study. In plants the COMPASS complex is responsible for increasing the frequency of trimethylation of histone 3 in the promoter region of actively expressed genes through association with an unidentified histone methyltransferase (Jianget al.2011). Previously, although there was strong evidence supporting the correlation between H3K4 histone trimethylation and gene transcription, no mechanisms were known to direct these epigenetic modifications in sequence-specific ways in plants (Liet al.2008,Zhanget al.2009). However,Songet al. (2015)showed that bZIP60 and bZIP28 interact with the proteins Ash2 (absent, small, homeotic like factor 2) and WDR5a (WD40 containing repeat 5a), which form the core elements of the COMPASS complex in plants (Jianget al.2011). Furthermore, the inducible expression of a subset of UPR responsive genes during ER stress was dramatically compromised in thewdr5aandash2mutants (Songet al.2015). The lasting effects of these epigenetic marks after ER stress are not clear, but H3K4 trimethylation marks accumulate on genes involved in heat stress memory (Lämkeet al.2015). This may indicate that the UPR plays an important role in priming plants against future environmental stresses. Furthermore, H3K4 methylation and the COMPASS complex also play important roles in mediating temperature sensitive transitions in plant development (Jianget al.2011,Kumar and Wigge 2010,Zilbermanet al.2008). Exploring how UPR stress signaling and the constitutive functions of UPR related genes integrate with these epigenetic regulating mechanisms through bZIP28 and particularly bZIP60 might also provide useful insights into the developmental phenotypes found inire1a/ire1b(Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Denget al.2013), which are deficient inbZIP60splicing.Send in the Cavalry: Downstream Effectors during ER StressNuclear translocation of spliced bZIP60 and cleaved bZIP28 leads to an increase in the transcription of genes coding for ER luminal proteins (BiP/Hsp70, ERdj/HSP40, HSP90), which (i) prevent aggregation of misfolded protein and newly translated polypeptides (Guptaet al. 2011), (ii) limit uncontrolled folding of nascent polypeptides through ERQC, and (iii) translocate terminally misfolded proteins across the ER membrane to the 26S proteasome by a group of membrane bound complexes in a processes collectively termed ER associated degradation (ERAD-L, -M and –C for luminal, membrane, and cytoplasmic ERAD, respectively (Olzmannet al.2013). These downstream effectors, although largely conserved across eukaryotes, have been found to have specific significance in plants during normal growth and in response to ER stress (Kleinet al.2006,Liuet al.2015,Yanget al.2009). A noteworthy example of this is provided in the study of the plant specific properties of the conserved ER luminal chaperone HSP90.7, also known inArabidopsisas SHEPHERD (SHD) (Ishiguroet al.2002). When compared to the non-selective foldase activities of its mammalian counterpart GRP94, the designation of HSP90.7 as a general ER chaperone in plants (like BiP/HSP70) has been questioned (Kleinet al.2006,Marzecet al.2012). In particular,ArabidopsisHSP90.7 which is highly upregulated under ER stress conditions was also found to have specific functions in proliferating tissues (Ishiguroet al.2002,Kleinet al.2006). Theshd (hsp90.7)knockout mutant is phenotypically identical toclva mutant defective in CLAVATA signaling, a critical negative modulator of shoot apical meristem activity, indicating it may be required for plant specific production of the CLAVATA peptide (Aichingeret al.2012,Miwaet al.2009). Additional plant specific activities of HSP90.7 were demonstrated byChonget al.(2014)who found that a short sequence of highly charged amino acids present only in plant ER-localized homologs drastically affected the survival rates ofArabidopsisseedlings under tunicamycin - and high calcium- induced ER stress. As expected overexpression of the HSP90.7 chaperone conferred significant resistance to tunicamycin, heat and high calcium induced ER stress; conversely overexpression of an HSP90.7 mutant with the highly charged 22 residue sequence deleted (HSP90.7Δ22), while still more resistant to heat stress than wild type, showed a marked increase in lethality in response to tunicamicyn compared to both native HSP90.7 overexpressor plants and even wild-type plants. These observations beyond illustrating plant specific chaperone functions also provide an important example which implies that in plants tunicamycin-induced stress may be responded to in a manner that is separate from heat induced ER stresses. Furthermore, it may be possible that the UPR directly mediates meristematic growth within undifferentiated tissues themselves through the HSP90.7/ CLAVATA relationship, perhaps in combination with transmission of signals through secondary messengers from distant tissues.Further examples of UPR effectors which have plant-specific roles in growth and development can also be found with respect to ERdj3 (ER resident J domain 3) protein function during gametophyte development (Yamamotoet al.2008). J domain proteins (Hsp40) found in the ER lumen bind BiP proteins and stabilize their interactions with client unfolded proteins (Misselwitzet al.1998,Yamamotoet al.2008). ERdj3A, which is induced under ER stress, contains a C-terminal protein disulfide isomerase domain that has reductive capabilities on substratesin vitro(Yanget al.2009), in addition to a HSP40 ATPase activity (Maet al.2015). This suggests that ERdj3A may act on a specific subset of client proteins. Furtherin vivoanalysis of ERdj3A and its homologs ERdj3B and P58IPKsupport this possibility by demonstrating their importance in development (Maruyamaet al.2014b). Indeed, genetic analysis of the mutantThermosensitive male sterile 1(tms1)revealed a nonfunctional allele of ERdj3A that under elevated temperatures was defective in pollen tube growth (Yanget al.2009). Under normal conditions, in conjunction with P58IPKand ERdj3b, ERdj3A was also shown to mediate polar haploid nuclei fusion in female gametophytes (Maruyamaet al.2014b) prior to double fertilization. During this nuclear fusion process, the perinuclear ER fuses with the outer nuclear envelope and creates a continuous outer membrane around the two haploid nuclei, and it is followed by a second fusion of the inner nuclear membranes (Jensen 1964,Maruyamaet al.2010). Recently it was demonstrated that ERdj3A and P58IPKare required for the fusion of the ER membrane with the outer nuclear membranes. A double knockout (erdj3a p58IPK)resulted in seed abortion after fertilization due to aberrant endosperm proliferation, similar to that found inbip1 bip2double mutants (Maruyamaet al.2010,Maruyamaet al.2014b). The inner membrane fusion requires the ERdj3B/ P58IPKpair, and although theerdj3b p58IPKdouble mutants had unfused haploid nuclei in close proximity, unlikeerdj3a p58IPKno aborted seeds were found (Maruyamaet al.2014a). The developmental defects found in plants with mutant alleles of UPR induced ER resident proteins (e.g., ERdj, BiP, SHD) are consistent with the evidence that pollen development in anire1a ire1bdouble mutant is highly vulnerable to heat stress (Denget al.2016,Fragkostefanakiset al.2016). However, the observed rescue of male fertility through the overexpression of a single COPII coat component SEC31a is intriguing given the large gene list shown to be regulated by IRE1 in these conditions (Denget al.2016). This underscores the need to fully understand the detailed functional mechanisms of downstream UPR components. Although studies exploring the similarities between yeast, mammalian, and plant UPR have led to significant advances in plant ER stress research, in order to fully understand the mechanisms connecting the UPR to plant specific physiology it will also be important to look at the contrasting characteristics. These plant specific cases, such as the single amino acid substitution in the case of SAR1a important for bZIP28 shuttling (Zenget al.2015), or the small charged region in the case of HSP90.7, which drastically alters stress responsive phenotypes compared to the deletion mutant (Chonget al.2014), are potent reminders to expect the unexpected, even in evolutionarily conserved contexts.NAC Membrane Transcription Factors: A Second Set of UPR activators?In addition to the transcriptional activities of bZIP60 and bZIP28, a veritable menagerie of plant-specific transcription factors is involved in the response to ER stress (Figure 2) (Sunet al.2013b,Yanget al.2014a,Yanget al.2014b). Thus far however, their mechanistic involvement in the UPR is yet to be fully elucidated. ANAC062 a plasma membrane-bound transcription factor, which is proteolytically cleaved and nuclear localized in response to cold stress, has been linked to the expression of multiple pathogenesis-related genes in a salicylic acid independent fashion and has also been shown to be upregulated under ER stress (Seoet al.2010). Overexpression of a truncated form lacking the C-terminal membrane domain was shown to induce canonical UPR responsive chaperones and improve prolonged ER stress outcomes (Yanget al.2014b), supporting a functional connection between ANAC062 and the UPR. Furthermore, ANAC103, a soluble nuclear transcription factor was shown to be transcriptionally induced under ER stress (Sunet al.2013b). Overexpression of ANAC103 with a small C-terminal deletion to enhance stability of the expressed protein was also shown to induce UPR genes, although true knockouts showed no appreciable ER stress phenotype suggesting a functional redundancy between ANAC103 and other UPR related transcription factors in response to tunicamycin (Sunet al.2013b). A third transcription factor, the membrane bound ANAC089, has been implicated in promoting programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. Inducible overexpression of truncated ANAC089 ignited mammalian apoptotic-like symptoms in roots (Yanget al.2014a). RNAi lines targeting ANAC089 also displayed resistance to tunicamycin induced ER stress (Yanget al.2014a). These results support earlier findings implicating ANAC089 in the control of ER-related homeostatic mechanisms.Smyczynsket al. (2006)in their study of a conserved immunophilin peptidylprolylcis-trans-isomerase PASTICCINO1 (PAS1) demonstrated through a series of biochemical experiments that PAS1 and ANAC089 (which they termed FAN, for FKBP associated NAC) interactin vivoandin vitro(Smyczynskiet al.2006). PAS1 is important in maintaining proper morphology during embryo development in Arabidopsis (Vittoriosoet al.1998). Expressed in response to cytokinin, ER-localized PAS1 associates with the VLCFA (very long chain fatty acid) synthesis complex and promotes sphingolipid biosynthesis and subsequently organ polarity through the lipids effect on the localization of the PIN1 efflux carrier (Roudieret al.2010). A C-terminal domain of PAS1 is required for interaction and co-localization with ANAC089 (Smyczynskiet al.2006). That same domain is also required for nuclear exclusion of the PAS1. Interestingly, both PAS1 and ANAC089 are highly expressed in the mature embryo and were found to relocate from ER to the nucleus dependent upon exogenous 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatment during cellular dedifferentiation in Arabidopsis root tips (Smyczynskiet al.2006). When overexpressed in thepas1loss of function allele, the full-length ANAC089 resulted in partial complementation of the deformed growth phenotype (Smyczynskiet al.2006). When this is taken into account in the context of the RNAi knockdowns of ANAC089 under ER stress, it may be possible that the reduction of endogenous ANAC89 may perturb cytokinin-auxin balance in a manner that promotes cell divisions in spite of continued stress signals. Taken together, these ANAC transcription factors may indeed play important roles in the secondary activation of the UPR cascade; they might also play important roles in activation of the UPR in response to other stress or hormone signaling mechanisms. For example, in a manner opposite STT3a which seems to prevent the activation of the UPR in salt stress conditions (Koiwaet al.2003), perhaps plants treated with tunicamycin in cold conditions may require NAC062 for full UPR gene expression regulation as cold signaling mechanisms may interfere with canonical activation of IRE1 or bZIP28. Expansion of combinatorial stress experiments incorporating tunicamycin-induced stress with other environmental stressors may give a more accurate picture of regulation, and downstream targets of these transcription factors. This may consequently lead to more information regarding the in vivo function of the unmodified transcription factors in relation to the unfolded protein response.Figure 2. UPR-regulated Transcription Factors may Tailor UPR Activation to Specific Stress Combinations.Open in a new tabSeveral plant-specific transcription factors are upregulated under ER stress in an IRE1/bZIP28 dependent way. Two membrane-bound transcription factors, ANAC062 and ANAC089, have been shown to relocate to the nucleus under ER stress. ANAC062 also is nuclear localized under cold stress conditions. ANAC089 along with interactor PAS1 (PASTICCINO1) were also shown to relocate to the nucleus in roots treated with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid to induce dedifferentiation. ANAC103, a soluble transcription factor, was also shown to upregulate UPR genes upon over expression. Although truncated forms of these transcription factors were shown to upregulate UPR responsive genes, the molecular mechanisms of action of native transcription factors are still unknown. After upregulation by IRE1/bZIP28 dependent mechanisms, these transcription factors may respond to secondary signals which reinforce or alter UPR gene expression."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionPhysiological and stress situations causing insufficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet cellular demands for secretory protein folding lead to a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress (Gething et al. 1992). To overcome ER stress and restore homeostasis, protective signaling cascades, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), are originated at the ER and lead to the synthesis of ER chaperones and foldases to attenuate ER stress. If this adaptive UPR fails, such in conditions of unresolved or chronic ER stress, cells commit to programmed cell death (Ron et al. 2007,Ruberti et al. 2015,Angelos et al. 2017). In all eukaryotes, the adaptive phase of the UPR is initiated with the activation of IRE1, an ER-associated membrane kinase and ribonuclease, which catalyzes the unconventional splicing of transcripts of bZIP-transcription factors: yeastHac1, mammalianXbp1, or plantbZIP60. This step is necessary for the production of an active transcription factor that controls the expression of UPR target genes (Deng et al. 2011,Nagashima et al. 2011,Moreno et al. 2012). In multicellular eukaryotes, the UPR has expanded to include additional UPR effectors, such as membrane tethered bZIP transcription factors (MTTFs), namely mammalian ATF6 and plant bZIP28. Upon sensing ER stress, these MTTFs translocate to the Golgi, where the cytosol-exposed transcription factor domain is proteolytically removed from the transmembrane anchor and translocated to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Liu et al. 2007b,Gao et al. 2008,Srivastava et al. 2013,Sun et al. 2013).In metazoan cells, a third arm of the UPR is activated by the ER associated PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) protein, which oligomerizes and autophosphorylates in conditions of ER stress. PERK activity results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2A thereby promoting a global repression of the rate of the protein translation (Harding et al. 1999,Shen et al. 2002). The transcription factors ATF4 and Nrf2 downstream of PERK are able to escape this translational repression and upregulate an oxidative stress response through the production of antioxidant proteins (Harding et al. 2000,Cullinan et al. 2003). Indeed, mutations in PERK signaling markedly increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which negatively affect UPR efficiency and the ability of cells to survive ER stress (Marciniak et al. 2004,Back et al. 2009,Han et al. 2013,Maity et al. 2016). In yeast, which similarly to plants lack PERK, a dysregulated production of H2O2under ER stress results in a translational attenuation of ER stress genes (Maity et al. 2016). Therefore, in metazoans and yeast, ROS cause attenuation of the cytoprotective functions of the UPR and acceleration of responses leading to cell death. In humans, this process potentiates the development of multiple diseases including diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis (Malhotra et al. 2007).In plants, a functional connection between ROS and the UPR management has not yet been clearly defined. During growth and in conditions of stress, several organelles including the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes generate ROS intracellularly (Tripathy et al. 2012). ROS are also produced in the apoplast mainly by the activity of the membrane-bound NADPH Oxidase (NOX) enzymes, known in plants as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) (Torres et al. 2002). The NOX/RBOH enzymes generate O2−through electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen (Gapper et al. 2006). O2−is highly reactive and is dismutated to H2O2either via the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes or spontaneously (Mori et al. 2004). H2O2is more stable than O2−and moves through membranes via aquaporins (Bienert et al. 2007), and it is therefore considered as a potent signaling ROS in plants (Sadhukhan et al. 2017). Thus far in plants, an increase of soluble H2O2and lipid peroxidation during ER stress have been reported (Ozgur et al. 2014,Ozgur et al. 2015,Ozgur et al. 2018) but the source of ROS during ER stress and the influence of ER-stress generated ROS on UPR signaling are not yet established. The oxidative function of ERO1 in the ER lumen is a significant source of ER peroxides both in homeostatic conditions of growth and during ER stress; however, an increase in NADPH Oxidase activity has also been observed via biochemical assays during the early UPR (Tu et al. 2004,Sevier et al. 2008,Zito 2015,Ozgur et al. 2018). Under similar conditions, small inductions in transcript levels of RBOHD and RBOHF, two plasma membrane-localized NADPH Oxidases (Torres et al. 2002,Torres et al. 2005), were also noted in tissues subjected to ER stress treatment, leading to the suggestion that increases in ROS levels were due to the respiratory burst oxidase homologs D and F (RBOHD and RBOHF) (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, it is yet to be experimentally tested to what extent RBOH activity contributes to the ROS levels during ER stress, and whether these enzymes are necessary for the actuation of effective ER stress responses. More generally, the downstream effects of increased ROS levels during plant ER stress responses are also largely unmapped. Previous reports have shown a variable regulation of the antioxidant defense systems under conditions of ER stress. For example, in conditions of ER stress the O2−scavenging activity of superoxide dismutase is induced in roots, but down-regulated in shoots. Conversely, H2O2scavenging activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase are upregulated in shoots but have no change in roots (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, in both roots and shoots a significantly increased glutathione content and glutathione reductase activity during ER stress lends weight to the conclusion that antioxidant defenses are upregulated to manage the increased ROS production in ER stress (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, critical questions remain unanswered. For example, it is yet unknown what effects an increase in ROS levels may have on the adaptive UPR, nor is it understood whether ROS may contribute to life or death decisions in temporary and chronic ER stress. To address these fundamental questions, in this work we explored the functional connection between ROS and the UPR in plants. We demonstrate that O2−and H2O2are significantly contributed by RBOHD and RBOHF during ER stress. We also show that RBOHD and RBOHF elicit a transcriptional response to ROS during ER stress in the adaptive UPR. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a stringent requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF to prevent the progression of cell death in recovery from temporary ER stress and under chronic ER stress. Together, these findings support a positive role of superoxide signaling in potentiating the cell’s ability to survive temporary and chronic ER stress and ascribe a significant role to two RBOH proteins in this process."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant\nArabidopsis thaliana\n. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.\nKey Words:\nSpaceflight, Unfolded protein response,\nArabidopsis\n, Microgravity.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionExtraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferlet al.,2002; Massaet al.,2016; Zhouet al.,2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paulet al.,2013). Recent iterations of the sophisticated chamber hardware for plant growth housed on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for multigenerational plant growth in space and analyses of plant responses to this environment (Massaet al.,2016). However, these facilities are insufficient for large-scale plant growth on extraterrestrial environments due to their size and resource cost. Therefore, generation of germplasm adapted to stresses experienced during growth in extraterrestrial environments is a critical contribution to the realization of sustainable plant cultivation in space.The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses. The UPR is generally activated by a buildup of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition known as ER stress (Ron and Walter,2007). The ER stress sensors conserved across metazoans and plants include the ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and ER membrane-tethered transcription factors (TFs) (metazoan activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and plant basic leucine zipper 17 [bZIP17] and bZIP28). Activation of IRE1 leads to unconventional splicing of an intron from the mRNA of an IRE1-downstream bZIP-TF (metazoan X-box binding protein 1 and plant bZIP60). The UPR TFs are translocated to the nucleus to control expression of UPR target genes and restore ER homeostasis (Koizumiet al.,2001; Chen and Brandizzi,2012; Halbleibet al.,2017; Kimet al.,2018; Rubertiet al.,2018; Tamet al.,2018; Mishibaet al.,2019; Pastor-Cantizanoet al.,2019; Puet al.,2019). Insufficient UPR leads to the actuation of cell death (Ron and Walter,2007; Walter and Ron,2011).In terrestrially grown plants, the UPR is a key mediator of responses to a variety of stresses, including heat, pathogen, and high light/singlet oxygen (Denget al.,2011; Morenoet al.,2012; Guillemetteet al.,2014; Zhanget al.,2015, 2017; Pastor-Cantizanoet al.,2019; Beaugelinet al.,2020). Additionally, analyses of higher order UPR mutants have demonstrated that the UPR regulators are necessary for post-embryonic growth and reproductive development inArabidopsisunder unstressed conditions as well (Chen and Brandizzi,2012; Kimet al.,2018; Mishibaet al.,2019; Puet al.,2019). Therefore, a better understanding of the UPR can enable efforts to potentiate plant stress responses and improve plant yield.Given the broad responsiveness of the UPR to environmental stresses, we hypothesized that the UPR effectors could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed global gene expression changes in wild type (WT)Arabidopsisas well as loss-of-function mutants of IRE1 (ire1a ire1b, herein dubbedire1), bZIP28, and bZIP60 (single and double mutants:bzip28,bzip60,bzip28 bzip60), cultivated in orbit during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to the ISS. We used these genetic backgrounds to identify genes controlled jointly or specifically by the UPR sensors and UPR TFs and define the extent to which the known signaling pathways of the UPR functionally interact in a whole organism under microgravity-associated conditions. We established that, in space and on ground, gene expression undergoes a substantial reprogramming on a genome-scale. Growth in orbit substantially altered the expression of thousands of genes associated with significant biological traits compared with ground controls. However, while many of these spaceflight-responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control, such a genotype-specific regulation was not observed in the spaceflight condition. These observations not only provide new insight into how plants respond to spaceflight, but also establish that spaceflight-induced transcriptional responses mitigate the need for the gene-regulatory networks controlled by the UPR sensors."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMaintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as\nFaecalibacterium prausnitzii\n,\nRuminococcus bromii\n,\nBlautia luti\n,\nAnaerostipes hadrus\n,\nRoseburia faecis\n, and\nLactobacillus rogosae\n, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap[1]outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities)[2]. These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible[3],[4].While the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]. Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome[4]. Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome[11],[12],[13],[14]. The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al[15]using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion ofFaecalibacterium prausnitziias well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers). Whether confinement can influence the GIT microbiome of long-term inhabitants is an important priority for future space missions[16]and was directly addressed in the longest-running human confined habitat experiment conducted to date, the Mars500 experiment[17].The Mars500 experiment isolated six astronauts within an analogue Mars-surface habitat. After 520 days, the six astronauts emerged as largely healthy, but the long-term confinement had significantly altered some of their physiology. Research conducted by Strollo et al.[18]measured significant decreases in total body mass (−9.3%), BMI (−5.4%) and lean (non-fat) mass (−11.8%) by day 417 of isolation. When considered alongside significant increases in fasting plasma glucose from a healthy median of 4.65 mmol/L at the beginning of the experiment to prediabetic levels of 6.02 mmol/L (impaired fasting glucose)[19], these findings are indicative of potential disruption in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in astronauts after extensive confinement. This aligned with significant losses of up to 22% of quadriceps/hamstring strength in astronauts, observed by Gaffney et al.[20]. In parallel, Roda et al.[21]observed that the loss of body mass was accompanied by a significant increase in the faecal protein calprotectin, the intestinal inflammation biomarker making up 60% of neutrophils (the cells which characterise intestinal inflammation[22]); from calprotectin negative in astronauts at the beginning of the experiment, towards varying degrees of positive by day 475. Further supporting this general trend towards an onset of intestinal inflammation, Yi et al.[23]directly observed a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils in the Mars500 astronauts after the 520 days of isolation, symptoms which are commonly observed in astronauts during space flight[24]. While Strollo et al.[18]hypothesised that the observed symptoms accompanied by an increase in calprotectin in later faecal samples could be indicative of common metabolic alterations associated with intestinal inflammation, they discounted any microbiome interactions due to prior research conducted by Turroni et al.[17], which did not identify significant microbiome changes over time and found only 14 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, representing putative microbiome species) were shared between the six astronauts. Here, the potential for common microbiome change in the Mars500 astronauts over time is reassessed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology[12]and a common data normalisation strategy for all six astronauts."

The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionUnder microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. Animal experiments have facilitated the investigation of the structural changes in the myocardium and skeletal muscles that arise during space flights.Previous research has revealed atrophic changes in the skeletal muscles of rats after space flight [1–4]. Moreover, early readaptation leads to more pronounced negative changes in the structure of muscle fibers than those observed immediately after the flight [5–7].A fluid shift in the cranial direction [8,9] and changes in systolic output [10–12] that are observed under conditions of weightlessness, could lead to functional changes in the cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, despite the decrease in the functional capabilities of the myocardium under conditions of microgravity, structural changes in the myocardium have not been observed after landing [1]. Data obtained from murine cardiomyocytes after the flight of the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 (dissection was carried out within 13–16.5 hours after landing) indicated that the levels of cytoskeletal proteins (beta- and gamma-actin, actin-binding proteins, desmin, and tubulin), as well as the expression levels of the genes encoding those proteins, were significantly changed after a 30-day space flight [13]. In the same experiment, Povysheva T.V. et al. showed that there were also changes in the structure of the myelinated fibers [14].Similar effects were also observed in cells cultivated under conditions simulating the effects of microgravity. It was shown under such conditions, a change in the structure of microfilaments and microtubules occurs in mesenchymal stem and embryonic stem cells, leading to a change in the cellular shape and differentiation potential [15–21]. Moreover, it was shown by live-cell imaging that poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells (FTC-133) developed less aggressive phenotypes under microgravity conditions [22]. However, recently obtained data indicate that under conditions of real weightlessness, the rearrangements of F-actin and intermediate filaments were not observed in macrophages [23].The effects of microgravity on gene expression have been documented in mammalian cells [24,25] and other model organisms, such as yeast and bacteria [26–28]. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear.DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic factors [29]. Although methylation patterns are established during development, environmental conditions can also induce changes in these patterns [30]. Thus, Weaver I.C. et al. showed that different maternal care leads to different methylation patterns of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (and correlates with its expression) in young rats and that these effects persist even into adulthood [31].To date, very few studies have been dedicated to the analysis of DNA methylation levels in space flight conditions or the modeling of the subsequent effects on Earth.Ou X. et al. [32] conducted experiments with rice plants during space flight and only showed hypermethylation that correlated with the transcription levels of genes. In contrast, Singh K.P. et al. [33] studied human T-lymphocyte cells, which were grown in a rotary cell culture system, and showed hypomethylation of the DNA. Chowdhury B. et al. [34] used TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells and ground-based simulation of microgravity with an HARV Rotary Cell Culture System for 48 hours and revealed that simulated microgravity induced alterations in the methylome (~60% of the differentially methylated regions or DMRs were hypomethylated and ~92% of the differentially hydroxymethylated regions or DHMRs were hyperhydroxymethylated).Therefore, there is a substantial amount of conflicting data regarding the effects of space flight on cell structure and the regulation of transcription, which may be due to varying periods between landing and biomaterial fixation.We suggest that for cardiac tissue, the early period of readaptation is accompanied by a decrease in volume load due to fluid shift. It could lead to the changes of the cortical cytoskeleton structure that were observed after the BION-M1 mission [13]. Therefore, we were interested in comparing the data from that biomaterial with data from biomaterial fixed under weightlessness conditions to avoid landing and readaptation effects. It can be assumed that such a strategy could provide us with a unique possibility to find methods for future investigations with the aim of protecting humans subjected to long-term space flight and the subsequent readaptation to Earth’s gravity and possibly that of Mars. The Rodent Research-1 experiment provided such an opportunity.In this paper, we present the results of a study of mouse heart and lung tissues obtained from the Rodent Research-1 experiment, where the biomaterial was fixed under space flight conditions in the US Orbital Segment of the ISS. We tested the protein and mRNA levels of the same cytoskeletal proteins (beta-actin, gamma-actin, alpha-actin-1, alpha-actinin-4, tubulin, and desmin) and compared the results to the previously observed data. In addition, after observing the relative changes in mRNA expression, we analyzed one of the possible factors affecting gene expression, total DNA methylation and its regulation."

        "Title": "Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target",
        "Abstract": "Graphical abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionFrom the first manned flight into space to sending humans to the surface of the moon, we have gained a better appreciation and understanding of the complexities of space travel. Now in the 21st century, current efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that take humans to Mars for the first time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident. NASA has identified several hazards of human spaceflight including space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures, and microgravity.1As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to microgravity with spaceflight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth.GSK3 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that has two known isoforms: GSK3α and GSK3β, with the latter being dominant in most tissues. It is a constitutively active enzyme, indicating that it has high protein kinase activity under resting conditions, though it can be inhibited through Ser phosphorylation (Ser21, GSK3α; and Ser9, GSK3β).2As both isoforms are structurally similar (95% sequence identity in their catalytic domains3), it is not surprising that they also share some functional redundancy, though unique and tissue-specific roles have also been demonstrated.4,5,6,7,8In general, GSK3 is thought to act as a “brake” in many anabolic pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and insulin signaling pathways.2In the context of the musculoskeletal system, GSK3 is a well-known negative regulator of both muscle9,10,11,12,13and bone mass2,10,14,15that not only slows the anabolic pathways but in many cases can also accelerate the catabolic ones.With its involvement in the regulation of both bone and muscle mass, it is possible that targeting GSK3 could represent a viable mitigation strategy against the musculoskeletal declines seen with spaceflight. Several lines of evidence found here on Earth are in support of this. We have shown that inhibiting GSK3 with lithium can increase myoblast fusion and differentiation10and promote osteogenic signaling in bones from mice.10Furthermore, patients being treated with lithium for bipolar disorder have been previously shown to have significantly reduced risk of fracture.16In addition, an impressive body of work from Dr. Boris Shenkman’s laboratory has shown that GSK3 is more active in muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) – a well-accepted simulated microgravity model – and that its inhibition can attenuate the consequential muscle remodeling (for review readers are referred to ref.17). Although the evidence from ground-based models suggests that GSK3 may be a viable target against the musculoskeletal decline observed with spaceflight, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have investigated this possibility in space. Moreover, the effects of spaceflight, if any, on muscle and bone GSK3 content/signaling remains unknown. This could be an initial first step in firmly establishing GSK3 inhibition as a potential countermeasure.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on murine muscle and bone GSK3 content and activation status. We obtained samples from various missions/payloads where male or female mice were exposed to microgravity for 30–37 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or the BION-M1 biosatellite. In addition to this, we characterized the effects of dual muscle-specific GSK3α/β knockdown on muscle size and strength as well as region-specific (tibia, femur, lumbar spine) bone mineral density (BMD) in response to simulated microgravity via HLS. In doing so, we provide evidence in support of targeting GSK3 to enhance bone and muscle health during spaceflight."

        "Title": "Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca\n2+\ndysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca\n2+\nATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca\n2+\nfrom the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca\n2+\nuptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III)\nmeso\n-tetrakis(\nN\n-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP\n5+\n(BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca\n2+\nleak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca\n2+\nleak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca\n2+\nleak.\nSubject terms:\nCalcium channels, Physiology",

        "Title": "Cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard the International Space Station exhibit altered developmental and functional properties",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (\nYAP1, RHOA\n) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (\nVIM\n,\nNES\n,\nDES\n,\nLMNB2\n,\nLMNA\n), non-canonical Wnt ligands (\nWNT5A\n,\nWNT9A\n), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (\nPLCG1\n,\nPRKCA\n) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (\nTNNT2\n,\nVWF\n, and\nRUNX2\n), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionChanges to the cardiovascular system during spaceflight have prompted molecular biologists to understand the mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to culture aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth.Recent research in our own laboratory has shown that neonatal human CPCs cultured under two-dimensional (2D) clinorotation, which approximates weightlessness by rotating the cell culture vessel about a horizontal axis, exhibit increased expression of markers of early cardiovascular development and pluripotency (i.e.,MESP1,T(Brachyury), andOCT4) as well as broad changes to microRNA expression.1The changes in microRNA expression experienced by CPCs in these experiments mirrored the expression of similar microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) under normal conditions of early cardiovascular development, thereby suggesting that such culture conditions induce an epigenetic environment that favors an earlier development status. Such a state appears increasingly beneficial for cardiovascular repair. For example, the efficacy of multipotent stem cells expressing Isl1+and SSEA-1+in ameliorating the symptoms of severe heart failure was recently demonstrated in one patient.2Furthermore, KEGG analysis indicated that the microRNAs downregulated in CPCs in these experiments target several signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Wnt, which are relevant to well-characterized repair mechanisms or cardiac stem cell proliferation mechanisms in the heart. For example, non-canonical Wnt ligands (i.e., Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) have been shown to be associated with the injury response in neonatal rodent heart tissue.3Therefore, our observations suggest that 2D clinorotation may foster a developmental state and signaling events that could enhance the use of CPCs for cardiovascular repair. This is supported by one recent study by Jha et al.4, which demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cells more readily differentiate into cardiomyocytes following three-dimensional (3D) (i.e., embryoid) culture under the influence of a random positioning machine. In the context of our previous findings, these experiments may highlight a potential phenomenon in which 2D clinorotation promotes an enhanced state of stemness that results in increased differentiation potential when the cells are returned to normal gravity conditions.It is currently believed that small RhoGTPases act as transducers of the mechanical alterations that are observed under conditions of spaceflight.5,6As actors in the planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, they have central roles in cytoskeletal remodeling. Along with the Hippo pathway and calcium signaling, small RhoGTPases represent one potential molecular substrate of gravity sensing. Notably, in the context of cardiogenesis, these processes are central to maintaining multipotency or directing differentiation.7Despite the early reports of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells, much is unknown about the mechanisms by which CPCs respond to spaceflight or how these cell types develop enhanced stemness. Hence, we are not yet able to leverage the therapeutic potential of spaceflight here on Earth. While current clinical trials to stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising,8–10they are stymied by a failure of cells to engraft into the host tissue and by the use of progenitor types that are restricted in potency.11Therefore, identifying the molecular events that promote enhanced stemness and regenerative potential in CPCs during spaceflight will benefit stem cell-based cardiac repair.The successful use of autologous CPC sources to regenerate heart tissue in a predominately adult population requires additional understanding of the differences between adult and neonatal CPCs. Our laboratory has previously documented differences in age-dependent expression of microRNAs related to MAPK signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction expression, and focal adhesion maintenance.12The relationship between these processes and the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight remain unknown, but they imply deficits in the intracellular transduction of environmental cues in the functional shortcomings of adult CPCs.Therefore, in this study, clonal lines of neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the ISS. We sought to identify changes in these CPCs in response to spaceflight that impact signaling, development, and stemness. We then characterized the divergent response of neonatal and adult CPCs to spaceflight. In doing so, we present components of the adaptive cellular response to culture aboard the ISS and their implications for enhancing the regenerative potential of neonatal and adult CPCs."

        "Title": "Inter-agency perspective: Translating advances in biomarker discovery and medical countermeasures development between terrestrial and space radiation environments",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOver the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.\nKeywords:\nSpace, Radiation, Medical countermeasures, Chronic, Cancer, Biomarkers",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionGiven the importance of ensuring the protection of humans from radiation injury, strong collaborations have been forged between U.S. Government funding agencies with mandates to develop products to protect, mitigate, and/or treat radiation-induced normal tissue injuries. There has been a strong track record of interactions between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - organizations that have been tasked with understanding mechanisms of radiation-induced biological damage and exploring pathways for the development of drugs to address radiation injuries. Past synergies have included co-sponsoring scientific meetings, co-funding research, and involvement through inter-agency grant/contract review teams and working groups. Several publications have resulted from these prior cooperative efforts (Carnell et al., 2017;Yoo et al., 2014). In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was established between NIH and NASA1to formalize interactions with each organization establishing areas of cooperation, including the “development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space.” NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also signed an interagency agreement in 2018 to share innovative ideas for addressing science and technology challenges and to coordinate and collaborate on research that could improve human health on Earth and in space.2Finally, since 2017 the NIAID/NASA Medical Countermeasures Working Group, with representation from NCI and other parts of HHS, has endeavored to rapidly and continually share information concerning research advances, to accelerate activities for all agencies.Although the core mission of these organizations is similar, each directs research efforts toward the specific needs of its target human population. For example, NCI’s interest in radiation stems from the use of localized, high-dose, gamma, x-ray, or proton radiotherapy in cancer treatments. Since incidental damage to surrounding normal tissues can limit the amount of radiation therapy delivered to a tumor, developing approaches using short-term administration of radioprotectants that are not tumor-protective is essential (Prasanna et al., 2012). Additionally, since the time of radiation exposure is known during radiotherapy, it is possible to administer radioprotectors before irradiation.Similarly, NASA’s concern is the protection of astronauts who will be exposed to low dose but extended periods of irradiation with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as possible immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. These outcomes also represent concerns for late effects of irradiation similar following a course of radiotherapy or after unanticipated low-dose exposures during a radiation incident. Characterization and mitigation of these risks require a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) high charge and energy (HZE) exposures and validation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in a relevant space environment (Simonsen et al., 2020). Although exposure levels are much lower than those used in radiotherapy, the duration of exposure is far longer. The intent of using mitigators is to prevent and/or reduce late effects thought to be associated with chronic, low doses of radiation. Thus, it is necessary to have products that are safe when dosed continuously because the time during a spaceflight when a harmful exposure may occur can be difficult to predict.Finally, the mission of the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP) within the NIAID is to address radiation injuries following prompt, high-dose exposure of civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. Because it is impossible to predict when these exposures will occur, use of prophylactic (pre-exposure products is not feasible; therefore, drugs that can mitigate (given post-irradiation but before symptoms manifest) or treat (given after clinically detectable injury) are of greatest interest. Like the NCI, high doses of radiation are of concern; however, the exposures are anticipated to be nearly total-body. NIAID’s primary focus is on developing effective approaches to improve survival and reduce the risk of major morbidities.Clearly, given limited budgets available for radiation research, to maximize opportunities for synergy, it is incumbent on NASA, NCI, and NIAID to leverage investments across mission spaces when possible. In addition, with a limited number of radiation researchers, principal investigators are often involved in, and receive funding from, all three agencies to carry out research projects that have some overlap. To that end, the authors have attempted to identify radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and radiotherapies in their respective portfolios, to address NASA’s concerns in the care of astronauts exposed to radiation in long-duration space travel. It should be noted that the focus of the present work is on drugs with potential use to mitigate damage resulting from chronic, long-term exposures. Therefore, a discussion of approaches to minimize acute radiation syndrome (ARS) risks to astronauts from solar particle radiation is not considered in depth. A separate review addressing this area has been released by the NASA Human Research Program (National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2016). Furthermore, gaps in each mission space are identified herein, and the need for shared approaches across these organizations to address them."

        "Title": "Genomic and functional characterization of Enterococcus faecalis isolates recovered from the International Space Station and their potential for pathogenicity",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nEnterococcus faecalis\nis a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism\nCaenorhabditis elegans.\nAt the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.\nKeywords:\nInternational Space Station (ISS),\nEnterococcus faecalis\n, pangenome, antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, pathogenicity",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionEnterococcus faecalisrepresent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment. Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (∼425 million years ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus (Lebreton et al., 2017). Supporting that proposition, enterococci display significantly higher levels of resistance to a variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and starvation than ancestral outgroups (Lebreton et al., 2017).Because traits contributing to environmental persistence also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment, enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated infections (Weiner et al., 2016). While certain strains ofE. faecalisare pathogenic for hospitalized patients,e.g., MMH594 (Huycke et al., 1991) and V583 (Sahm et al., 1989), and possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates are 25% smaller, as typified by the strain OG1RF (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci (Fiore et al., 2019). Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors (Shankar et al., 2002), however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined.The ISS provides a unique opportunity to study the establishment of a microbiome in what originated as a clean, hermetically sealed built environment, where the influx of new microorganisms only occurs periodically with the arrival of new crew and supplies. The microbiome of the ISS has been extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic (Be et al., 2017;Lang et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2018b;Urbaniak et al., 2018;Blaustein et al., 2019;Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019) and culture-based investigations (Schiwon et al., 2013;Venkateswaran, 2017;Singh et al., 2018a;Blaustein et al., 2019;Mora et al., 2019;Sobisch et al., 2019;Urbaniak et al., 2019), yet only recently have these effort been combined (Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019). The results are divided among those that report similarities to Earth built environments (Schiwon et al., 2013;Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019) including United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (Be et al., 2017), and those that detected significant differences from terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project (Lang et al., 2017), the Japan-based ISS analog module (Ichijo et al., 2016), and a French Guiana-based cleanroom (Mora et al., 2019). Despite the differences in methodologies and results, the detection of opportunistic human pathogens (Schiwon et al., 2013;Be et al., 2017;Lang et al., 2017;Mora et al., 2019;Singh et al., 2018a,b;Sielaff et al., 2019;Sobisch et al., 2019;Urbaniak et al., 2019) includingE. faecalis, is a common phenomenon. With the exception ofBe et al. (2017), the previous metagenomic efforts were limited to characterizing diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution to confidently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed forStaphylococcus aureus(Blaustein et al., 2019) andEnterobacter bugandensis(Singh et al., 2018a), only a single culture-based report has quantified pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporumisolates from the ISSUrbaniak et al., 2019) in a host model. As a result, the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact crew health remains unclear.In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS, understanding the effects of spaceflight on bacterial physiology will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health. WhenPseudomonas aeruginosawas exposed to spaceflight, there was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass, biofilm thickness, and the cells produced a unique biofilm architecture not seen in ground controls of the species (Mclean et al., 2001;Kim et al., 2013).Su et al. (2014)documented growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and conversion) inBacillus cereusandSerratia marcescensduring spaceflight (Wang et al., 2014). Carbon utilization profiles were altered amongS. marcescensclones after flight, and transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed significant changes in metabolic functions (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally,Wilson et al. (2007)utilized proteomic analysis and expression profiles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation ofSalmonella typhymuriumwere widely distributed, and virulence was increased in response to spaceflight. AlthoughHammond et al. (2013)report a significant decrease inE. faecalisOG1RF virulence when grown under spaceflight conditions, this was inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures grown in the presence of adultCaenorhabditis elegansrather than worm viability.In addition to altered microbial physiological responses, astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceflight environment. Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation, abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been shown to weaken an astronaut’s immunity in as little as 10 to 15 days (Crucian et al., 2013), and these effects can persist up to 6 months post mission ISS (Crucian et al., 2015). This weakened immunity, combined with the prevalence ofE. faecalisstrains, or other potential pathogens including viruses (Rooney et al., 2019), could result in severe human health consequences on board the ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the introduction of a percutaneous catheterMermel, 2012).With the detection of enterococci, we sought to determine the risk they posed to residents within the ISS – specifically, do they represent pathogenic lineages commonly associated with infections in hospitals, or do they represent commensals shed into the environment as a consequence of human habitation? In order to determine if the challenging environment of the air and surfaces of the ISS have selected for pathogenic strains ofE. faecalis, we coupled previously employed genomic data analyses (Singh et al., 2018a) with phenotypic characterization ofE. faecalisisolates recovered onboard the ISS. By assessing their antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity in the well-establishedC. elegansmodel (Garsin et al., 2001), we sought to test existing methods for identification of strains ofE. faecaliswith a high likelihood of causing in-flight infections."

We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the\nin vitro\ndevelopment of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.\nKeywords:\nGene expression, Differentiation, Macrophage colony stimulating factors, STS-126",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionAlthough the value of the space shuttle has been controversial (Charles, 2011), one of the accomplishments of the space-shuttle era has been to establish that there are profound physiological changes during space flight (Chapes, 2004;Charles, 2011;Fagette et al., 1999;Harris et al., 2000;Ronca and Alberts, 2000;Stowe et al., 2003;Suda, 1998). In particular, we have evidence that space flight suppresses hematopoietic differentiation of macrophages and other blood cells (Ichiki et al., 1996;Sonnenfeld et al., 1992;Sonnenfeld et al., 1990;Vacek et al., 1983). Space flight has been found to decrease blood monocytes in circulation (Taylor et al., 1986), induce monocytes lacking insulin growth factor receptors (Meehan et al., 1992), and it changes leukocyte subpopulations in the bone marrow and spleen (Baqai et al., 2009;Gridley et al., 2009;Ortega et al., 2009;Pecaut et al., 2003). Decreases in the expression of the GM-CSF receptor may explain some of thein vivophysiological changes in macrophages that have been observed (Kaur et al., 2005).Space flight experiments with rodents also have revealed a diminution in the percentage and number of early blast cells (CFU-GM) in bone marrow (Sonnenfeld et al., 1990,1992). There were also increases in the number of CD34+cells in the bone marrow of mice assessed after the flight of STS-108 (Pecaut et al., 2003). Skeletal unloading, using antiorthostatic suspension, simulates some of the physiological changes associated with space flight (Chapes et al., 1993;Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998,2002) also diminishes the number of macrophage progenitor cells in the bone marrow and affects hematopoiesis (Armstrong et al., 1993,1994,1995a;Dunn et al., 1983,1985;Sonnenfeld et al., 1992). Therefore, there are important health issues that might arise from space flight impacts on hematopoiesis.Space flight affects cells by inducing broad physiological changes and/or it can have direct gravitational impacts on the cells themselves (Todd, 1989). We previously addressed the direct impact of space flight on macrophage differentiation at the cellular level on three different space shuttle flights (Space Transportation System (STS)-57, 60 and 62). There was increased mouse bone marrow macrophage proliferation and inhibited differentiation based on changes in expression of MHCII and Mac2 surface molecules (Armstrong et al., 1995b). Because these studies were done at less than optimal physiological temperatures (22.5–27.0 °C), there were some questions about the impact of these conditions on the outcome.During the flight of the space shuttle Endeavour, STS-126, we had an opportunity to re-examine macrophage growth and differentiation from stem cells at optimal physiological temperatures (37 °C). This experiment allowed us to assess bone marrow differentiationin vitroin the absence of the complexin vivoenvironment. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) may have been responsible for the effects of space flight on bone marrow macrophage differentiation. We also had an opportunity to assess global changes in transcript levels to provide insights about biochemical processes that may have been perturbed during the differentiation process."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium,Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensisis primarily vectored byAmblyomma americanum(lone star tick) (Anderson et al., 1993) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks (Parola et al., 2005).A. americanumhas a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal (Parola et al., 2005). The major natural reservoir ofE. chaffeensisin the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Dawson et al., 1994;Lockhart et al., 1997). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog (Yu et al., 2008), domestic goat (Dugan et al., 2000), white-footed mouse (Magnarelli et al., 1997), red fox (Davidson et al., 1999), raccoon (Dugan et al., 2005), and coyote (Kocan et al., 2000). Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate (Sotomayor et al., 2001). Although it is clear that ticks can transmitEhrlichiaorganisms to vertebrate hosts (Ewing et al., 1995;Varela-Stokes, 2007), andEhrlichiabacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically (Smith et al., 1976) and by PCR (Karim et al., 2012), it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed (Pagel Van Zee et al., 2007), the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such asDrosophila melanogaster.In adultD. melanogaster, hemocytes contribute to host immune defenses againstE. chaffeensis(Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance (Chapes and Ganta, 2008;Ganta et al., 2002) even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered thatD. melanogastergenes,separation anxiety(san) andUridine cytidine kinase 2(Uck2), are required forE. chaffeensisinfections in flies (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage ofDrosophila UAS-GAL4RNAi system (Dietzl et al., 2007) that allowed for tissue-specific silencing ofsanandUck2to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, inDrosophilathe bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression ofUck2orsan) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) is a major threat to pig production and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust antiviral countermeasures. Pathologically, a significant elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.\nMethods\nUsing the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nResults\nThe screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.\nConclusions\nTogether, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02374-2.\nKeywords:\nAfrican swine fever virus, Antiviral, Anti-inflammatory, Cytokine production, Screening",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two\nin vitro\nculture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)\n1\nwere operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood in order to interpret space flight data.\nKeywords:\ncell differentiation, macrophage, fluid processing apparatus, space flight hardware",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight and/or microgravity can alter the immune system at organismic levels [1,2]as well as cellular levels [3–5]. In particular, the hematopoietic system that generates cells in the monocyte/macrophage lineage may be a target. In 1986, Tayloret al. [6]detected monocytopenia post flight in seven out of 11 astronauts that flew on the space shuttle. In addition, some astronauts exhibited changes in insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor expression on monocytes post flight [7]. Changes in colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and colony forming units-macrophage (CFU-M) were seen in rats, post flight on biosatellites [8,9]and during the Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS)-2 space lab flight on space transportation system (STS)-58. [10]. However, comparison of CFU-M after two 7-day space shuttle flights found that there were inconsistencies in CFU-M in the bone marrow of rats post flight [11]. We also found different outcomes when we measured the development of CFU-Min vitroafter three different shuttle missions (Figure 1). During STS-69, a 260 hr. mission, we found that significantly more CFU-M developed in cultures grown in space compared to ground controls. In contrast, during STS-73, a 382 hr space-flight mission, we found the opposite result with inhibited CFU-M generation in space-flight cultures compared to ground controls (Figure 1). There was no impact of space flight on CFU-M generation during the STS-77 shuttle mission, a 240 hr. mission.Figure 1. CFU-M development on STS-69, 73 and 77.Open in a new tabSoft agar colony assays to detect CFU-M (macrophage colony forming units) were conducted in FPAs as described [12]. Colony assays were set up for shuttle flight on STS-69 and 73 (and the associated ground controls) approximately 48 hours prior to turnover to the shuttle loading crew. The FPAs were equilibrated for 12 hours at 37° C and 8% CO2capped with rubber septa to trap equilibrated air, and shipped at ambient temperature to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for integration into Group Activation Packs (GAPs) [21]. To control for transportation of the FPAs to KSC, ground controls were conducted at KSC and in our laboratory at Kansas State University (KSU). Colony assays set up for shuttle flight and ground controls for STS-73 were set by harvesting bone marrow cells at KSU which were immediately shipped in RPMI10(on ice) to KSC. Ammonium Chloride lysis of red blood cells and all subsequent assay procedures were performed in the laboratory facilities at KSC Space Life Science Support Facility (SLSL). These assays were set up approximately 20 hours prior to turnover to the shuttle loading crew. As a result of the assay setup being conducted at KSC there were no ground controls conducted at KSU.Space flight experiments are extraordinarily challenging. Not only do you have to modify experimental conditions and equipment for the space-flight environment, the ability to reproduce the exact flight conditions from flight-to-flight is next to impossible. Occasionally, one finds that equipment used for space flight is an advance on the technique used for normal ground experiments [12], but this is rare. Frequently, secondary payloads are at the mercy of the requirements of the primary payloads. Therefore, variables such as temperature, astronaut time for manipulations and time-lines are not optimal.The assay of macrophage hematopoietic precursors can be done two ways. To identify the number of precursors, bone marrow cells are isolated and cultured in soft agar containing growth factors such as macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at appropriate concentrations [13]. Assessment of how many colonies grow provides an estimate about the number of CFU-M or CFU-GM that are present in the stem cell population [14]. Alternatively, macrophages can be induced to differentiate in M-CSF and the cells that differentiate into macrophages in 6–8 days can be phenotyped based on their cell-surface molecules, assayed for functional assays, or used for other kinds of analyses [15].Our group had an opportunity to determine if macrophage development was affectedin vitroon the space shuttle flights STS-57, STS-60 and STS-62 [16]. Mouse bone marrow stem cells were incubated in liquid culture in medium containing M-CSF during the space flights. The differentiated macrophages were fixed during flight and phenotyped by flow cytometry and the supernatants were collected from viable cells and were assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) post flight. However, because these experiments were secondary payloads, the temperature conditions were not physiological and some questions about the results remained[16]. Therefore, we explored additional opportunities to attempt to resolve the issue about the impacts of space flight on macrophage development at the cellular level."

        "Title": "Bone marrow leptin signaling mediates obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in male mice.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nObesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (\ndb\n/\ndb\n) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with\ndb\n/\ndb\nbone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes\nTnfa\n,\nIl6\n, and\nCcl2\n. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMetabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in\nNos2\ntranscript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.\nKeywords:\nMacrophages, Leptin receptor, Immortal cell line",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionLeptin, the product of theobgene, is a 16 kDa peptide hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes (Ahima and Flier2000; Zhang et al.1994). Leptin is structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al.2005). Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by theLeprgene (Chen et al.1996). The LepR exists in six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al.1996). The long isoform of LepR is a member of the interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s physiological activities (Baumann et al.1996; Tartaglia et al.1995).Leptin is involved in a plethora of physiological actions, and plays a major role in the regulation of neuroendocrine function and energy homeostasis (Chan et al.2003). Leptin stimulates the production of anorectic neuropeptides and suppresses the action of orexigenic peptides in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Cheung et al.1997; Schwartz et al.1997; Thornton et al.1997), where LepR is highly expressed (Elmquist et al.1998). In addition, leptin exerts other physiological effects that impact reproduction, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and immunity (Wauters et al.2000). Leptin’s effects are exerted through the expression of LepR on different types of tissues and cells throughout the body; these are often referred to as leptin’s peripheral effects. Furthermore, leptin plays an important role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity (La Cava and Matarese2004; Matarese et al.2005), and different immune cells express LepR, which supports the notion that leptin plays a direct role in immune function (Matarese et al.2005). T-cells (Batra et al.2009), B-cells (Papathanassoglou et al.2006), neutrophils (Caldefie-Chezet et al.2003), monocytes (Raso et al.2002), dendritic cells (Mattioli et al.2005) and NK cells (Tian et al.2002) all express LepR, and leptin has been shown to modulate their functions in vivo and in vitro (Papathanassoglou et al.2006).Leptin induces diapedesis of monocytes and macrophages through an epithelial layer in vitro and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from both cell types (Curat et al.2004; Gruen et al.2007). In macrophages, leptin augments LPS-induced cytokine secretion (Gainsford et al.1996; Loffreda et al.1998) via IRAK-1 up-regulation, (Vaughan and Li2010) and potentiates IFN-γ-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase (Raso et al.2002).Non-genetic obesity is characterized by a hyperleptinemic state (Considine et al.1996) and a compromised immune system (Falagas and Kompoti2006). In addition, there is increased pro-inflammatory macrophage recruitment in the adipose tissue of obese individuals (Weisberg et al.2003; Xu et al.2003), and “obese” macrophages have impaired phagocytic activity (Krishnan et al.1982; Mancuso et al.2002).It remains unclear what promotes a proinflammatory state in obese animals and people and their higher susceptibility to infections. Our central hypothesis is that leptin contributes directly to this problem by regulating macrophage function. Our objective here was to create a continuous macrophage cell line to allow for investigation of LepR’s impact on macrophage function. We detail the properties of this new leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1 in this paper."

In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.

Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionB cells are an important part of the adaptive immune system, arising from hematopoietic stem cell precursors. These cells express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors and secrete these same proteins as antibodies into the serum after differentiation into plasma cells [1,2].As B cells develop, they rearrange Variable- (V), Diversity- (D), and Joining- (J) gene segments, which combine with a constant region to form the antibody structure [3,4]. Antibodies consist of heterodimers of heavy and light chains [4]. The heavy chain is formed from V-, D-, and J-gene segments combined with a constant region [5], while light chains lack a D-gene segment. [3,6].There are three complementarity determining regions (CDR). CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded in the V-gene segment. CDR3 consists of a combination of V-, (D-, heavy-chain), and J-gene segments [7]. Of the CDRs, CDR3 contributes the most to binding specificity. Antibodies are further characterized by the constant region, or isotype, which is influenced by the stage of B-cell development and antigen specificity [8].The total collection of antibody specificities present within an individual is known as the antibody repertoire. Diversity of the antibody repertoire results from four main components: the initial germ line (inherited), diversity from recombination of that germline, the imprecisions during V(D)J recombination, and somatic mutations [9–11]. The antibody repertoire has been examined in many studies by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and fully mapped in the zebrafish [12].Repertoires can serve as a fingerprint or snapshot of the current immune-system status and these types of data have been used to explore the development of host defense to infectious disease [13–18], cancer [19–22], autoimmune disease [23,24], and early disease detection [25]. With the development of HTS, we are now able to detect the differences between or among B-cell repertoires such as B2 (adaptive antibodies) and B1 (natural antibodies) B cells [11] or memory and naïve repertoires [26,27]. HTS has accelerated the characterization of the widely differing human Ig haplotypes [28–32], and strain-specific gene segment usage in mice [33].Our long-term goals are to investigate the repertoire of B cells in mice in space and how it changes in response to antigen challenge. More specifically, our lab is interested antibody repertoire dynamics within the context of spaceflight. Due to the cost of these experiments, creating datasets that can be mined by our lab or others is important. The antibody repertoire is traditionally assessed through the amplification of Ig sequences that have been isolated from sorted B cell populations [34]. While these practices increase the likelihood of recovering rare Ig sequences and allow for the dissection of the antibody repertoire by B-cell populations, cell sorting may not be possible within the design of certain experiments. During the development of methodology to assess Ig-gene usage by mice subjected to space flight we performed multiple HTS runs to validate sample preparation, bioinformatic methodology, and reproducibility [35]. We also wanted some background data about the Ig repertoire in the normal B6 mouse population. Knowing that there can be significant mouse-to-mouse variability in the Ig repertoire [36,61] and to minimize the impact any one mouse might have in the validation data set, we chose to pool multiple mice specifically for these validation experiments [35]. We now present these data on the splenic repertoire of conventionally housed, unimmunized, unchallenged, adult C57BL/6J mice."

        "Title": "Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.\nKeywords:\nImmunoglobulin Gene Use, Next Generation Sequencing, Bioinformatics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight presents a unique set of challenges to the immune system. For example, spaceflight alters T- and B-lymphocyte functions, including recall responses in astronauts aboard the space shuttle and cytokine responses after missions to the international space station (ISS) (Berry, 1970,Crucian et al., 2013,Crucian et al., 2014b,Grigoriev et al., 1993,Stein and Schluter, 1994,Taylor and Dardano, 1983,Taylor et al., 1986,Rykova et al., 2008). In addition to functional changes, lymphocyte subpopulations are altered. CD8+ T-cell numbers were increased during flight while other T-cell subsets were decreased (Crucian et al., 2013). Similar changes in phenotype also occur in animal and tissue culture systems during spaceflight or ground-based spaceflight analogs such as anti-orthostatic suspension (AOS) (Chapes et al., 1993,Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016,Crucian et al., 2014a,Nickerson et al., 2003,Sonnenfeld, 2005).Lymphocyte subpopulations change in response to spaceflight (Allebban et al., 1994,Chapes et al., 1999a,Gridley et al., 2009,Gridley et al., 2013,Ichiki et al., 1996,Pecaut et al., 2003,Sonnenfeld et al., 1990,Sonnenfeld et al., 1992) and AOS (Gaignier et al., 2014,Wei et al., 2003). Splenic T- and B-lymphocyte counts were decreased in mice flown on the 13-day mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) compared to ground controls (Gridley et al., 2009). In the AOS model, Wei et al. found a reduced number of both T and B lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of hindlimb unloaded Balb/c mice compared to normal controls (Wei et al., 2003). Reductions in the mass of lymphoid organs has also been observed (Armstrong et al., 1993,Baqai et al., 2009,Chapes et al., 1999b,Chapes et al., 1999a,Congdon et al., 1996,Durnova et al., 1976,Gaignier et al., 2014,Grove et al., 1995,Pecaut et al., 2000). Spaceflight altered the phenotype of immune cells in the bone marrow, the lymphoid organ in which hematopoiesis occurs (Ortega et al., 2009), and AOS reduced the number of bone marrow B-cell progenitors (Lescale et al., 2015).While many studies have characterized T-cell response to spaceflight (Chapes et al., 1999a,Cooper et al., 2001,Grove et al., 1995,Lesnyak et al., 1993,Lesnyak et al., 1996,Nash et al., 1992,Nash and Mastro, 1992,Sanzari et al., 2013,Sonnenfeld et al., 1998,Cogoli et al., 1984,Cogoli-Greuter, 2004,Chang et al., 2012,Gridley et al., 2009,Hwang et al., 2015,Martinez et al., 2015,Tauber et al., 2015), fewer studies have characterized the impact of spaceflight on B-cell populations. The characterization of B-cell receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Igs), is of particular interest due to the (IgH) and light chains, which are encoded on separate loci (Tonegawa, 1983). The heavy chain locus encodes multiple Variable- (V), Diversity- (D) and Joining- (J) gene segments, while the functionally equivalent κ (Igκ) and (Ig) light chain loci contain only V- and J-gene segments (Early et al., 1980,Sakano et al., 1979). During early B-cell development in the bone marrow, B cells undergo recombination of heavy and light chain Ig loci, in which only one of each V(D)J-gene segment is selected for Ig use (Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976,Tonegawa, 1983). Random and palindromic nucleotide insertion at splice sites adds to Ig diversity (Alt et al., 1984,Gilfillan et al., 1993,Komori et al., 1993).In the Ig molecule, complementarity determining regions (CDR) confer binding specificity. CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded entirely within the V-gene segment, while CDR3 contains a portion of the 3’ end of the V-gene segment, the entire D-gene segment, and a portion of the 5’ end of the J gene segment (Kabat et al., 1979,Tonegawa, 1983,Xu and Davis, 2000). As a result of somatic recombination, B cells collectively express individual Igs that theoretically can bind virtually any pathogen.An individual’s Ig repertoire can be characterized using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using either genomic DNA or messenger RNA sequences isolated from B-cell populations (Georgiou et al., 2014,Rettig et al., 2017,Wardemann, 2017). B cells will clonally expand after antigen-Ig receptor engagement, resulting in a higher portion of target-specific Ig receptors within the B-cell population. There have been a number of HTS-based Ig repertoire studies in human disease, ranging from infectious disease (Ademokun et al., 2011,Khurana et al., 2016,Lee et al., 2016,Parameswaran et al., 2013), autoimmunity (Tan et al., 2014,Tan et al., 2016,Zuckerman et al., 2010), and cancer (Bashford-Rogers et al., 2016,Jiang et al., 2015,Logan et al., 2011,Montesinos-Rongen et al., 2014,Tschumper et al., 2012). Greiff, et al. developed a profiling framework using the Ig repertoire as an indicator of an individual's immunological status (Greiff et al., 2015).Some have explored the impact of spaceflight on Ig repertoires.In vitrochallenge of human B cells during spaceflight resulted in lower concentrations of secreted Ig (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). There was no significant difference in pre- and post-flight Ig levels in peripheral blood of astronauts who flew aboard the ISS (Stowe et al., 1999,Rykova et al., 2008,Voss, 1984). These samples, however, were not taken after challenge with a specific antigen. Rats immunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells prior to spaceflight produced significantly less serum IgG compared to immunized ground control animals (Lesnyak et al., 1993).Although some have explored Ig gene segment changes in the context of spaceflight or model analogs (Boxio et al., 2005,Bascove et al., 2009,Bascove et al., 2011,Huin-Schohn et al., 2013), little has been done to characterize the impact of spaceflight on the Ig repertoire in mice. Given that changes in B cells and Ig concentrations occur during spaceflight conditions, we tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the Ig repertoire of mice flown on the ISS. We examined individual Ig gene segment usage, gene segment combinations, CDR3 composition, and frame work and CDR mutations in 35-week-old, unimmunized, female C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS using high throughput sequencing."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.\nKeywords:\nHigh throughput sequencing, Immunoglobulin genes, Mouse, Heavy Chain, RepSEQ",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAntibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels. At the protein level, these molecules are heterodimers joined with disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains. At the genetic level, the antibody specificity is influenced by semi-randomly recombining a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments that are encoded in the genome. This V-D-J, or in the case of the light chain, V-J rearrangement, also influences antibody specificity by random and semi-random base insertions or deletions during the recombination process. In the end, the collection of antibodies produced, the antibody repertoire, is a fingerprint of what antigens an organism has been exposed to and a measure of immunocompetence. Sequencing has become easier, cheaper, and faster in recent years. Antibody repertoires have been sequenced in numerous species, in response to vaccinations (1–3) and infections (4–6), and have been employed in cancer detection; providing valuable feedback regarding the immune system’s response to challenges and for early cancer detection in patients (7,8).In an effort to supplement unamplified MiSeq data sets used in our laboratory (9), we explored the use of commercial processes that use technologies to amplify sequences to increase the depth of coverage of specifically targeted immunoglobulin gene transcripts. These data sets are created using massively multiplexed PCR reactions that are subsequently sequenced on the Illumina platform. Multiplex amplification strategies have been used to explore the T cell (10,11) and B cell repertoires (12–15) and biases, omissions (10,11,16–18).and PCR artifacts have been detected in the data sets (10).We started this project with the hypothesis that our unamplified data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, we are unaware of any immunoglobulin repertoire studies that have been done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This manuscript describes our results comparing a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in theF8gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.1,2,3This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.6Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative gene therapeutic approaches,7and in particular, hemophilia A has become a showcase indication for exploring and refiningin vivogene therapy principles.8This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of theF8transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.9,10,11,12Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built on this concept are being tested clinically,13and the most advanced program has already received marketing authorization (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector designed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-SQ.14,15Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013and 6 × 1013vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong.15Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immunogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expression,17,18,19reflected in a drop or even loss of activity within the first couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a transient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved.20,21The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.

CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOvarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (\nn\n= 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat;\nn\n= 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (\np\n< 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.\nSubject terms:\nPhysiology, Developmental biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight microgravity is known to impact numerous physiological systems. These include cardiovascular changes, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle tone, adipogenesis, insulin resistance, vision and vestibular disturbances, altered fluid and electrolyte balance, and altered kidney function to name a few1. Many, if not all, normal homeostatic processes occurring within mammals, both male and female, are dramatically impacted by gonadal hormones. Indeed, the reproductive system is often considered one of the best markers of overall health and fitness of an animal2. However, research is limited regarding the effects of spaceflight on the reproductive system and its consequences on normal physiology3,4.The ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, play a significant role in regulating a myriad of physiological functions, and are subject to cyclic changes based on the hypothalamic/pituitary regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis5. Moreover, ovarian steroidogenic output can be dramatically impacted by stress as well as other internal homeostatic processes6. In cycling rodents, the antral follicle is the primary steroidogenic tissue within the ovary, unless mating occurs at which time the corpus luteum becomes the major producer of progesterone. The mural granulosa cells and the vascularized theca cells within the antral ovarian follicles are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to its ultimate endpoint product estradiol. In addition to steroidogenesis, these follicular cells also carry out the critical missions of nurturing the enclosed growing oocyte, as well as facilitating the process of ovulation, or expulsion of oocyte, and subsequent formation of the ephemeral corpus luteum. Cyclic and temporal changes in expression of steroidogenic pathway proteins and other critically important ovarian genes known to play critical roles in ovulation, oocyte development and corpus luteum development and function are well known and may be evaluated to provide information regarding ovarian function. Understanding these molecular changes is vital for informing female reproductive health during and after spaceflight.To date, studies of ovarian function and fertility in mice exposed to microgravity during NASA Space Shuttle flights were of short duration (<12 days) and, importantly, all included the effects of live reentry prior to collection of tissues and analysis of animal behavior3,7. Similarly, pregnant female rats flown on Cosmos 1514 (1982), NASA-NIH Rodent (R)1 (STS-66 in 1994), and NASA-NIH R2 (STS-70 in 1995) were of short duration (4.5–11 days) and had live animal return8–10. Notably, in the pregnant rats no effects of spaceflight on healthy and atretic ovarian antral follicle populations, fetal wastage in utero, plasma concentrations of progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) or pituitary content of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were noted8. Spaceflight, however, significantly increased plasma concentrations of FSH and decreased pituitary content of LH analyzed postpartum (day 22–23;8). In these prior studies, it is not possible to separate the effects of microgravity from that of reentry with the associated hypergravity, turbulence, and the likely ensuing stress responses linked to these events. Moreover, these studies while evaluating maintenance of pregnancy, provide no information regarding the fertility of these animals and their ability to exhibit normal estrous cycles and ovarian function. The current investigation provides insights into the endocrine status and ovarian cyclicity of female mice following an extended period of exposure to microgravity in the absence of reentry effects. Addressing the effects of extended duration spaceflight on endocrine status are significant and of high impact to long-term female astronaut health before and after flight, interpretation of spaceflight findings derived from female mice, and for long-term plans for multigenerational mammalian studies in spaceflight."

While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses.\nResults\nHere, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nin modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that\nP. aeruginosa\ngrown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type\nP. aeruginosa\nto a\nΔ\nmotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.\nConclusions\nThese results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.\nKeywords:\nSpaceflight, Microgravity,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, Flow cytometry, Motility",

        "Title": "Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nwas cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionManned space missions conducted over the past 50 years have expanded our knowledge of the universe, and have led to the identification of a range of challenges that must be addressed as we move towards the next phase of human space exploration. A key concern is how microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment affect bacterial growth, physiology and virulence. Several in-flight studies have reported that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial growth and physiology, including increased final cell density, antibiotic resistance, and virulence (reviewed by Hornecket al.[1]). However, the effects of spaceflight on microbial community behaviors, such as biofilm formation, have not been systematically addressed. Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to have harmful effects on astronauts including decreased immune system function[2]. Recent in-flight studies usingDrosophilaand mouse models have also shown that spaceflight can suppress the innate immune system[3],[4]. The combined microgravitational effects of decreased immune function in space travelers and increased resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the health of the crew during long-term space exploration.To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do not typically represent real-world situations because the majority of bacteria in nature exist in surface-associated microbial communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host defense systems[5]. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to control using conventional antimicrobial treatments[5],[6]. Indeed, abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water purification system[7]. Ground-based studies have indicated that corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts[8]. An experiment using simulated microgravity showed thatEscherichia coligrown in simulated microgravity form thicker biofilms and exhibit increased resistance to stress compared to normal gravity controls[9]. In experiments conducted aboard STS-95, McLeanet al.observed thatPseudomonas aeruginosais able to form biofilms during spaceflight[10]. However, their experimental system did not enable quantitative comparisons of biofilms formed during spaceflight and normal gravity. More recently, Wilsonet al.observed thatSalmonellacultured during spaceflight exhibited increases in cellular aggregation and clumping, processes that are associated with biofilm formation[11]. Despite such evidence that biofilm formation may be altered in a low gravity environment, systematic studies comparing biofilm formation during spaceflight and normal gravity have not been reported.To examine the role of microgravity on microbial biofilm formation, we conducted two sets of experiments aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-132 and STS-135) where we examined the growth ofP. aeruginosaPA14, an opportunistic human pathogen and a model organism for biofilm studies. Previous studies have examined how planktonicP. aeruginosacells respond to simulated microgravity and the spaceflight environment[12]–[16]. Crabbéet al.,identified 167 genes and 28 proteins that were differentially regulated during spaceflight, and showed that the global regulator Hfq plays a key role in howP. aeruginosaresponds to microgravity[16]. To studyP. aeruginosabiofilm formation during spaceflight, we used specialized hardware designed for growing cells during spaceflight, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA;Figure S1). FPAs have been used in several recent studies of bacterial growth and physiology during spaceflight[11],[16],[17]. Briefly, an FPA is a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments by rubber stoppers. During spaceflight, a plunging motion can be used to mix the components loaded into the different compartments via a bevel on the side of the glass barrel. For our experiments, a mixed cellulose ester membrane disc was used as a biofilm substrate. A modified artificial urine media (mAUM,Table S1) was loaded into the first compartment containing the membrane. mAUM was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of biofilms formed both inside and outside the human body[18]. The second compartment was filled with inoculum stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For microscopy samples only, a third compartment was filled with a paraformaldehyde solution. As illustrated in the timeline shown inFigure S2, biofilms were formed under static conditions in FPAs at 37°C for 72 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 8°C to minimize further growth, and fixative was added to the microscopy samples. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.Here, we report the first evidence that spaceflight affects biofilm formation byP. aeruginosa, with increased numbers of viable cells, increased biomass, and increased thickness observed in spaceflight biofilms compared to normal gravity controls. Biofilms formed byP. aeruginosaduring spaceflight also exhibited a column-and-canopy-shaped architecture that has not been observed previously. We show that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of this novel architecture, and relate the mechanism to structured biofilm formation on Earth."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOpportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020;Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012).The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets includeHomo sapiens(human),Mus musculus(mouse),Drosophila melanogaster(fruit fly),Arabidopsis thaliana(model higher plant),Oryzias latipes(Japanese rice fish),Helix lucorum(land snail),Brassica rapa(Fast Plant),Eruca vesicaria(arugula/edible plant),Euprymna scolopes(Hawaiian bobtail squid),Ceratopteris richardii(aquatic fern), and the bacterium,Bacillus subtilisfrom experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020).NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools.The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms.Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010;Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download.Figure 1.Open in a new tabGeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP)(A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change.(B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumanity is on the brink of a new era in space exploration, with NASA and international partners committed to returning to the Moon and planned manned missions to Mars (Dawson, 2016). Exposure to space radiation and microgravity are primary hazards to astronauts’ health in long-duration space missions (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). In addition to the known increased cancer risk from chronic low doses of radiation exposure (Durante and Cucinotta, 2008), astronauts that returned from missions on the International Space Station (ISS) presented with health issues similar to geriatric stress, including bone and muscle mass loss, central nervous system issues, immune dysfunction, and cardiovascular health risks (Strollo et al., 2018). Future success in long-duration space exploration requires a comprehensive understanding of the impact of spaceflight on human biology, and such knowledge could be used to design efficient countermeasures that would benefit astronauts and the health of people on Earth.Here, we provide an integrated analysis of mammalian space biology using a systems biology approach powered by multiple “omic” platforms. Realized by the existence of NASA’s GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) (Ray et al., 2019), a dedicated space omics database, our work includes 4 human cell models, 13 different tissues (11 mouse and 2 human), 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/C), and space missions ranging from 2006 to 2017, culminating in the measurement of astronaut blood and urine metabolites, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Gertz et al., 2020).Our data-driven approach resulted in three discoveries. First, spaceflight effects were more evident in isolated cells than whole organs, suggesting that tissue complexity plays an essential role in response to space-related stress. Second, the liver undergoes more differential gene and protein expression changes than other organs, consistent with the role the liver plays as a dynamic and critical hub in sensing changes in blood composition and maintaining homeostasis. Finally, our comprehensive pathway analyses identified how spaceflight impacts mitochondrial function at the genetic, protein, and metabolite levels of cellular, tissue, and organismal biology."

With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, knowledge graph, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionNASA recognizes five main hazards of spaceflight to human health, including altered gravity (microgravity and hypergravity), ionizing radiation, isolation/confinement, hostile/closed environment, and distance from Earth. These health risks caused by the space environment resemble multiple disorders found on Earth, including muscle atrophy and bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, immune dysfunction, and central nervous system deficits [1]. Therefore, repurposing current FDA-approved treatments for issues that arise during spaceflight could significantly reduce the time needed to develop new therapeutics and limit their side effects.Since its establishment in 2015, NASA GeneLab [2] has become a prominent open-source repository of data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. This platform has enabled computational analysis of multi-omics data, visualization of results, and integration with descriptive metadata, such as environmental data (e.g., space radiation dosimetry). GeneLab has already supported dozens of published studies, created a global collaboration to develop uniform standards for spaceflight-omics [3], and resulted in new space biology discoveries [4,5]. However, it has not yet been possible to use NASA GeneLab to combine and compare space and terrestrial data. Such capability would be a major advancement in fundamental spaceflight biology and its applications, including identifying new targets or repurposing terrestrial therapeutics for spaceflight countermeasures.NASA GeneLab is planning to set up a portal dedicated to computational modeling that enables comparisons between datasets in addition to already existing data input, query, analysis, and visualization capabilities. Knowledge graphs (KGs) would be a suitable approach to facilitate this goal by unifying disparate datasets into a human queryable framework. KGs have already been widely adopted in biomedical research to unravel the complex relationship between biological changes and disease phenotypes [6,7,8,9,10].Specifically, a new massive UCSF-based KG database, the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) has transformed structured data from over 30 human biomedical databases (-omics, chemical structures, molecular and cellular responses, physiological data including e.g., patient symptoms and drug side effects, etc.) into a KG with almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types and over 10 million edges of 32 types [11,12]. Therefore, SPOKE has the potential to be combined with the NASA GeneLab modeling portal, expanding it to link terrestrial biomedical sciences to space biosciences research and space medicine.In this study, we integrated data from six different NASA GeneLab datasets in SPOKE to enable normalization that highlighted new nodes defining systems and effects that are known to be relevant for space travel but would have been impossible to uncover without using SPOKE (workflowFigure 1a). These results suggest that SPOKE can be utilized to gain a deeper biological understanding of the health hazards associated with spaceflight and provide the proof of concept for its broader utilization to integrate space and terrestrial biological data.Figure 1.Open in a new tabAnalysis workflow and summary of experimental conditions across GeneLab datasets used for the analysis.

In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6and tissue and organ degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies on animal models have shown several spaceflight stressors directly impacting brain molecular mechanisms causing neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurovascular damage8–11. Specifically, exposure to simulated space radiation at doses comparable to the ones expected during the planned Mars mission, leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in vivo and in tissue and cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodent models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS), include a redistribution of body fluids from lower towards upper body parts, leading to significant cardiovascular13and CNS changes14. However, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms and specificity of these impairments, and identify targets for countermeasure development.Studies performed directly on astronauts have to be minimally invasive, resulting in limited information on molecular and cellular level outcomes, while spaceflown rodent models allow the range of subcellular to behavioral-level investigation of spaceflight effects. In this study, we used spatial transcriptomics and multiomics to explore spaceflight-induced molecular changes in brain tissue of young adult female BALB/c mice samples obtained during the Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission and requested from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC). We combined single-nucleus multiomics (i.e., snMultiomics, RNA and ATAC sequencing) with Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data to study changes in chromatin accessibility and RNA expression in different cell types and brain regions and to identify key regional and cell type differences in responses to spaceflight.Single-cell sequencing is a powerful method to obtain information about the cellular composition of a tissue and cellular-level responses to perturbations. However, the applicability of single-cell transcriptomics relies on the accessibility of fresh specimens and the possibility to successfully dissociate the tissue of interest15. Since sample preparation in spaceflight studies typically involves in-orbit freezing of the entire carcass to simplify the experiment and minimize crew time, single-nucleus transcriptomics becomes a more feasible method. Using single-nuclei multiomics, we were able to assess both transcriptional profiles and chromatin changes within the same nuclei, thus providing paired data of RNA expression and chromatin accessibility.While single-nuclei sequencing methods facilitate the study of individual nuclei transcriptomes, they lack spatial context. Therefore, spatial transcriptomics is a powerful addition, enabling the comparison of effects among brain structures and providing transcriptomics information coupled with the original location within tissue sections16.Overall, our study is a stepping stone towards the understanding of the molecular changes induced by the space environment at the resolution of individual cell type and brain region. Our findings not only advance the knowledge of the neurological effects of spaceflight, but also provide a critical foundation for future space biology mission designs."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceflight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)1–3provides open and FAIR4access to spaceflight and space-relevant biological studies from the past decades. Research enabled by OSDR data has revealed a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants to mammals (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html). Most prior research using OSDR data has focused on model organisms such as rodents, worms, and fruit flies. These valuable measurements provide insight into the response of neuromuscular, immune, and developmental biosystems to the stressors and hazards of spaceflight. Integrating human in vivo data takes these studies one step further and map previously characterized model organisms’ biological responses to the limited knowledge on human physiology in space.The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In the current specialNaturepackage titled “The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,” a wide battery of analyses of these data have already provided valuable insights (Mason et al.,Nature. 2023).The I4 mission stands as a significant milestone, amassing an extensive collection of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, thereby adding an invaluable series of datasets for deciphering the repercussions of spaceflight on human health. The open access of these datasets in the NASA OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, citizen scientists, researchers, and students to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. In this short article, we guide the readers on how to best conduct future analysis by presenting a series of vignettes illustrating pathways for accessing metadata and data from this rich resource through OSDR. We hope these guidelines will help the community contribute further to the vast compendium of findings already published from OSDR data and enable new hypotheses to be tested with both the human and model organism data.Compared to traditional model organisms used for research, one unique aspect of these data is the breadth of longitudinal measurements available from several human astronauts. Such temporal information for several individuals is unprecedented and pushes further the well-known “NASA’s Twin Study”5where a single astronaut was monitored over 340 days on the international space station, referred to as a “N of 1” experiment. In contrast, even though the duration of the I4 mission was much shorter (3 days), it was at a higher altitude (590 km vs. 420 km), and since it featured four individuals monitored with such biological depth, the data opens the door to new and innovative follow-up studies (e.g. Polaris Dawn missions).Incorporating environmental data with microbiome data and a wide variety of phenotypic and high-throughput sequencing assays provides a rare opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessment of short-term and long-term spaceflight effects on humans. These datasets also provide a much-needed ability to compare human spaceflight effects to the previously characterized spaceflight consequences in model organisms.The analyses conducted thus far on the I4 mission’s data have already yielded substantial revelations, shedding light on the intricate interplay between space stressors and the immune system, cell-specific responses to spaceflight, rapid microbial interchange of the crew, and detailed maps of the changes in the skin from astronauts (Overbey et al., Nature 2023; Tierney et al., Nature Microbiology 2023; Kim et al., Nature 2023). These analyses demonstrate the great potential of these data for future knowledge. The inclusion of multi-modal data, such as the blood datasets, which cover a diverse array of measurements (OSD-569, −570, −571, −575), also presents an exciting avenue for future exploration. This broader scope for analysis could unveil deeper connections between different biological responses and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the body’s adaptations to the space environment. Combining omics and medical assay data is the first step to understanding the biological significance of integrated findings. Translating them into actionable insights for space health will be our next step, which remains challenging but, for the first time, attainable.Looking ahead, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in the analysis of biomedical data from the I4 mission also holds great promise. With all OSDR data accessible in a cloud-based public repository, standardized metadata, and a robust API query system, this effort demonstrates AI readiness and empowers our user community to explore beyond current findings. The sheer volume and complexity of the data call for advanced computational approaches that can uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden. Powerful techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, hold the potential to extract meaningful but complex insights from the vast dataset, facilitating the identification of subtle trends and potential health risks associated with space travel. NASA OSDR’s commitment to FAIR practices ensures that researchers across the globe can harness the power of AI to conduct cutting-edge analyses, fostering collaboration and accelerating the pace of discovery. Finally, this work sets a precedent for space agencies to establish comprehensive, post-mission health monitoring programs, incorporating omics and medical assay data, while informing future mission planning and health risk mitigation strategies."

        "Title": "NASA GeneLab derived microarray studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens organisms in altered gravitational conditions.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples.\nSubject terms:\nDatabases, Molecular biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionNASA GeneLab platform, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR;https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) constitutes an omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) interactive open-access database where users are able to upload, download, share, store and analyze data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. Approximately half of the datasets in the GeneLab repository consist of transcription profiling assays. The most prevalent transcription study assay type is microarray with RNA sequencing data being the fastest-growing assay in the database. Other assay types include genome sequencing, protein expression, metabolite profiling, epigenomics, metagenomics, and epitranscriptomics1,2.There are still many unknown mechanisms regarding the biological effects taking place during spaceflight. Discovering these mechanisms is essential for NASA’s goal to keep its astronauts healthy, especially with the planned human deep space exploration missions, which are near the horizon. From the very first space missions, it became evident that microgravity causes physiological changes to mammals, including significant abnormalities presented in the cardiovascular, immune, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems3,4. There are multiple and intricate hazards to human health and performance in spaceflight caused by a combination of environmental stressors such as gravitational alterations, ionizing radiation, high level of carbon dioxide, changes in diet and physiological stress. Appropriate countermeasures must be developed in order to effectively minimize the aforementioned impairments3,5–7. Due to the small size of the astronaut cohort and privacy concerns surrounding human data collection and sharing, most spaceflight data originate from model organisms rather thanHomo sapiens. An example of a model organism isMus musculus, a suitable model for studying the effects of altered gravitational conditions. Current knowledge of the effects of spaceflight is derived from experimental models in vivo, ex vivo (e.g., tissue) and in vitro (e.g., cell culture)8.Opportunities for actual microgravity experiments are rare and challenging to access due to the infrequency of spaceflights and the various associated restrictions, including expenses, equipment requirements, and the need for volunteers. Thus, space analogs, such as random positioning machines, clinostats, head-down bedrest, hindlimb unloading rodent model, and rotating wall vessel, have been developed aiming to simulate altered gravity conditions9–11.In this study, we review the effects of microgravity and other spaceflight environmental factors onHomo sapiensandMus musculusbased on microarray studies and experiments housed in the NASA GeneLab repository1,2. We primarily focus on experiments that have been conducted in either actual or simulated microgravity in order to determine the affected functionalities at the gene, cellular or organ levels."

        "Title": "Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAim:\nFluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”?\nMethods:\nVarious aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific\nCav1\ngene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1\nflox/flox\n; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells.\nResults:\nIn each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility.\nConclusion:\nMacromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.\nKeywords:\ncaveolin-1, lymph propulsion, lymphatic contractility, lymphatic permeability, nitric oxide",

        "Title": "Fungal diversity differences in the indoor dust microbiome from built environments on Earth and in space.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHuman occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s\nArtemis\nmissions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R\n2\n= 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.\nSubject terms:\nEnvironmental microbiology, Fungi",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn the upcoming decades, human activity in space will rapidly expand both in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond to an estimated $1.4 trillion dollar industry1. NASA’sArtemismissions, which will send humans back to the moon, includes a lunar orbiting space station (The Lunar Gateway) as well as a lunar surface habitat, and will all be a stepping stone to sending humans to Mars2. In addition, private companies, such as Starlab Space, LLC and Blue Origin, are building commercially owned and operated space stations with support from NASA’s commercial LEO destination initiative3. The rapid increase in the number of people living and working in space will require careful spacecraft design to support human health and wellbeing. One critical aspect of this design is to understand the microorganisms within a spacecraft.The International Space Station (ISS) has been a continuously inhabited confined environment in LEO since November 2000, and over 12,000 microbial species have been identified onboard4. The ISS is a closed system and the microbes primarily originate from the astronauts onboard5, as all humans have a distinct associated microbial ecosystem6. Other potential microbial sources on the ISS include plant experiments being grown onboard7, as well as those from the original construction materials. The ISS has its own unique microbiome, as does every human-occupied indoor environment on Earth.Similar to Earth-based indoor environments8, many of these microbes can reside in the dust generated onboard the ISS9. This is due to the high nutrient content in dust that microbes can utilize, with moisture being the limiting factor for growth10,11. Bacterial communities from ISS dust and other Earth-based confined environments such as clean rooms, operating rooms, and intensive care units each contain a similar core microbial community12, although there are some significant differences between environment types13. Whether in space or on Earth, it is critical to maintain microbial communities indoors that support human health14. For instance, health effects on Earth are associated with microbial growth15, and thus it is critical to prevent this growth by controlling indoor moisture. Although, NASA standards for nominal relative humidity conditions on the ISS is between 25 and 75%16, there are pockets of elevated moisture present due to astronaut hygiene, exercising, in food areas, and in plant habitats. This study also provides insight into how microbial communities will react to unintended conditions such as a ventilation system failure or fire suppression event. There have also been reported issues reported on the ISS due to unintended microbial growth such as crewmember infections17and destruction of plants onboard18. However, we need an improved understanding of how the microbial communities on the ISS compare to typical occupied spaces on Earth, and how these communities change under unexpected adverse conditions such as excess moisture.The goal of this study is to determine similarities and differences between microbial communities and growth under elevated moisture conditions in occupied spaces on Earth and the ISS. Here, we leverage raw sequencing data from two previous studies with nearly identical methods that have performed microbial analyses on dust collected from the ISS19and from Earth-based residential homes20. These studies have a special focus on indoor fungi and characterize what happens when ideal growth conditions occur such as the introduction of elevated moisture conditions. This is a unique one-to-one comparison as methods were performed in the same laboratory, therefore all incubation, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics protocols are almost identical. Key differences between the studies were the presence of dust in carpet for Earth-based samples and different starting dust mass concentrations (50 mg for Earth-dust and 25 mg for ISS dust).The ISS is a complex environment that serves as an astronaut home, workplace, and transportation environment. While it can’t be distinctly classified as only one of these, we chose the residential home comparison because people on Earth spend most of their time in their home and to emphasize that astronauts are spending all their time in the spacecraft, including during sleep. This comparison of Earth- and space-based microbiomes in continuously occupied indoor environments will help us gain a better understanding of how the unique conditions experienced during spaceflight may alter microbial communities. As humanity becomes more active in space, the need to define what a healthy microbiome is in human occupied spacecraft will grow ever more important. These results can inform both Earth-based and future space-based indoor spaces on how microbial communities may change to identify any potential problems that may arise when unintended microbial growth occurs in these environments."

        "Title": "Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.\nResults\nHere, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10\n6\nspore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10\n10\nwhen exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (\nQ\n< 0.05) and beta (\nR\n2\n= 0.307,\nP\n= 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (\nR\n2\n= 0.22,\nP\n= 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (\nQ\n< 0.05).\nConclusion\nOur results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed\nin vitro\nusing acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R\n2\n= 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPostmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by pronounced bone resorption. A clear link between estrogen deficiency and reduced bone mass is evident by the increased prevalence of osteoporosis in women vs. men[1]and the direct association between circulating estrogen levels and rates of bone loss[2]–[5]. In addition, estrogen replacement serves to protect against skeletal fractures and loss of bone[6]primarily by inhibiting bone resorption[7]. The preponderance of literature examining the effects of estrogen status and bone remodeling has attributed the association to the direct effects of estrogen on bone cell activity. However, there are other possible mechanisms whereby postmenopausal bone loss may be influenced and modulated.There is increasing evidence in the literature that the osseous vasculature influences bone remodeling. For example, vascular endothelial cells release factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) that are known to modulate osteoclast and osteoblast activity[8]–[11]. In addition, the osseous resistance vasculature regulates skeletal perfusion and, consequently, fluid filtration and interstitial fluid flow, which can affect bone cell activity through release of autocrine/paracine factors[12]–[17]. Dysfunction of these vascular mechanisms could therefore contribute to postmenopausal and old age-related osteoporosis. Indeed, attenuated bone and marrow blood flow has been reported in healthy humans (>60 years of age)[18],[19], senescent rats[20]–[22]and rabbits[23]and is associated with osteopenia[24]. Old age-related decrements in skeletal perfusion also correspond with diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), reduced vascular NO bioavailability, and diminished trabecular bone volume and material properties of the femur in male rats[20]–[22]. Thus, aging and estrogen loss may contribute to enhanced bone turnover in females through impairment of endothelial responsiveness in the skeletal circulation.The purpose of the present study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone blood vessels, and whether this is associated with changes in trabecular bone volume. Estrogen levels were modified in young and old female rats through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement. We hypothesized that the lower estrogen levels in old intact and young and old ovariectomized (OVX) rats would be associated with lower femoral PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and that estrogen replacement in young and old OVX rats would enhance PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation through a NO signaling pathway. Furthermore, we hypothesized that PNA endothelial vasodilator function would be directly associated with trabecular bone volume."

        "Title": "Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nChronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.\nKeywords:\nBone Blood Flow, Hindlimb Unloading, Vascular Resistance",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAdipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that\n1\n) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and\n2\n) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo;\nn\n= 40) and old (24 mo;\nn\n= 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min\n−1\n·100\n−1\ng; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min\n−1\n·100\n−1\ng) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.\nKeywords:\naging, adipose tissue, blood flow, α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, exercise",

Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels.

        "Title": "Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: Implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for\nin vitro\nvascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (\nn\n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (\nn\n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized\nvia\nnanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.—Taylor, C.

The present study sought to determine whether exercise training improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise.\nMethods\nSix-eight month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) with treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15° incline for 60 min/d over a 10–12 wk period. Sedentary (SED) control animals were acclimated to treadmill exercise for 5 min/d during the week preceding the blood flow measurements. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula were determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m/min walking, 0° incline) using the reference sample microsphere method.\nResults\nThe results demonstrate an augmentation of exercise hyperemia above that observed in SED rats during exercise in only one region of bone, the femoral diaphysis of ET rats. However, while exercise hyperemia occurred in 3 of the 9 hindlimb bone regions measured in SED rats, exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 regions in ET rats.\nConclusion\nThese data indicate an increase in generalized hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow during physical activity following a period of exercise training. Elevations in regional bone and marrow blood flow after training may augment medullary pressure and bone interstitial fluid flow, thus benefiting bone integrity.\nKeywords:\nskeletal blood flow, vascular resistance, bone hemodynamics, microcirculation",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.\nKeywords:\nhindlimb unloading, bone blood flow, microcirculation",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe increase in fracture risk observed among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been suggested to be associated with corollaries of the disease, such as peripheral neuropathy, decreased physical fitness, vision loss, and poor balance (Leslie,et al.2012,Melton,et al.2008,Schwartz. 2003). Emerging research also suggests a causal link between cardiovascular function and indices of bone health (Farhat & Cauley. 2008,Lampropoulos,et al.2012,Parfitt. 2000,Prisby,et al.2012). Cardiovascular disease is a leading complication of T2DM (Grundy,et al.1999,World Health Organization. 2013), including impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of large conduit arteries (Hogikyan,et al.1998,Makimattila,et al.1999,Rossi,et al.2005,van de Ree,et al.2001).Previous findings using the obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (Lesniewski,et al.2008), an animal model of T2DM, demonstrate that an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the nitric oxide (NO) signaling mechanism effectively changes the balance of vasomotor control in skeletal muscle arterioles to favor vasoconstriction. Decreases in BMD have also been shown to occur in obese ZDF rats with long-term T2DM (Prisby,et al.2008) and is one basis for the decrease in mechanical strength of long bones in the hindlimb. It was hypothesized that one contributing factor to this decrease in BMD and mechanical strength could be a reduction in bone and marrow blood flow and impairment of coupling mechanisms linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone cell remodeling activity (Prisby,et al.2008). For example, reduced blood flow to the bone and marrow of the femur occurs in aged rats (Prisby,et al.2007), and this is accompanied by an impairment of the ability of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) to vasodilate by way of a NO signaling mechanism (Prisby,et al.2007). In addition, prior experiments with young and old exercise trained rats (Dominguez,et al.2010) and ovariectomized rats (Prisby,et al.2012) suggest a coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to measures of bone volume. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether control mechanisms of the skeletal resistance vasculature, including endothelium-dependent vasodilation, are altered during the progression of T2DM when BMD is both increasing and decreasing (Prisby,et al.2008). We hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA would be higher in pre-diabetic 7-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is greater than that in 7-wk old lean ZDF rats, and that endothelium-dependent vasodilation would be impaired in long-term diabetic 20-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is reduced. Results from these vascular studies demonstrated that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA was diminished with long-term diabetes, along with other vascular mechanisms that serve to regulate bone perfusion. Consequently, a secondary purpose of this study was to determine the effects of frank T2DM on hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance. We hypothesized that bone and marrow perfusion would be lower in long-term diabetes relative to that in 20-wk old lean ZDF animals."

Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) (\nn\n= 6), habitat control (HC) (\nn\n= 6), and vivarium control (VC) (\nn\n= 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis.

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, vasoconstriction, endothelium-dependent vasodilation, brain blood flow",

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",

Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training.\nNEW & NOTEWORTHY\nAging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAstronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (\nn\n= 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1\ng\nartificial gravity (µg + 1\ng\n). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (\np\n< 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1\ng\ngroup. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, ocular tissue, microgravity, artificial gravity, apoptosis, proteomics, oxidative stress",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionApproximately 30% of astronauts on short-term (~2 week) Space Shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (~6 month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity [1]. Previous studies of rodents also show that environmental conditions associated with spaceflight and simulated microgravity induce alterations in retinal structure and function [2,3,4].Retinal damage and degeneration can occur as a result of multiple factors, including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. Our previous data from Space Shuttle studies showed a significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells of flight mice compared to ground controls [2], which could lead to morphologic changes and impairment of retinal function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those associated with a spaceflight environment, in facilitating retinal damage are less studied and remain unclear.Data on the response of biochemical systems to altered gravity is very limited in animal studies [5]. Some lines of evidence suggest that one of the mechanisms involved in response to spaceflight, including changes in the gravity vector, is likely due to oxidative stress [2,6,7]. Studies have shown that exposure to microgravity during spaceflights is associated with elevations in oxidative stress and production of lipid peroxidation in both humans and rodents [8,9]. However, our knowledge about the duration or dose of microgravity exposure needed to induce oxidative stress or alterations in retinal structure and function is extremely limited. For example, one study has shown that even transient exposure to microgravity produced by parabolic flight can cause alterations in retinal vasculature to occur [1]. One means to address the impact of microgravity conditions is through the application of artificial gravity (AG) during spaceflight.Creating AG by centrifugal force makes it possible to have a partial gravity or Earth-like gravity (1g) control in space, where all other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight are present. A newly developed mouse habitat cage unit (HCU) by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been installed in the Centrifuge-equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS [10]. This rodent centrifugation capability provides opportunities to compare the effectiveness of AG prescription under spaceflight conditions. Since the HCU can reproduce Earth-like gravity, it can be used to test the effectiveness of AG to mitigate the effects of microgravity on physiological systems [11].The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceflight-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1gAG during spaceflight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina. We hypothesized that spaceflight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inflammation and metabolic function. We further hypothesized that the application of 1gAG would mitigate these changes."

This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin.\nMethods\n: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined\nin vitro\nusing wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining.\nResults\n: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls.\nConclusion\n: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, hindlimb unloading, rat, small arteries, remodeling, sympathetic innervation, noradrenaline, serotonin",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe vascular system is constantly exposed to mechanical forces such as transmural pressure and shear stress, the latter of which is created by flowing blood on the endothelial cell lining of the vessel. Prolonged changes in these factors govern gross structural remodeling of blood vessels, which in turn affects their functional characteristics. For example, previous work has shown that chronic increases in transmural pressure induce hypertrophy of the vascular wall and increases in vessel contractility, while decreases in pressure result in the opposite changes (Folkow, 1982). Chronic increases in shear stress, in turn, lead to structural increases in maximal diameter, whereas decreases in shear result in a narrowing of the vessel lumen (Langille, 1993;Pourageaud and De Mey, 1997).The cardiovascular system of all terrestrial inhabitants is adapted to the gravitational field of the Earth and changes significantly in conditions of weightlessness (Watenpaugh and Hargens, 1996). Importantly, redistribution of transmural pressures and flows within the arterial vasculature during space flight or simulated microgravity is known to initiate different adaptations in vessels from different anatomic regions (Zhang, 2001,2013). In humans, exposure to long term head-down bed rest was shown to reduce intimal-medial thickness and lumen diameter of arterial vessels in lower extremities, in contrast to upper extremity and cranial arteries (Bleeker et al., 2005;Platts et al., 2009).The model of hindlimb unloading (HU) in rats is commonly used to study the mechanisms of microgravity effects on different body systems, including vasculature (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). Even relatively small change in hydrostatic pressure gradient, as observed in the rat body with this model (Colleran et al., 2000), results in different vascular alterations in rostral and caudal parts of the body. Similar to microgravity effects in human vascular system, rat hindlimb arteries commonly demonstrate wall thinning and lumen reduction, in contrast to cranial arteries (Wilkerson et al., 1999;Delp et al., 2000;Sun et al., 2004;Stabley et al., 2013).Data from the literature also provide the evidence that transmural pressure shifts cannot explain all effects of simulated microgravity on vascular characteristics, because vascular alterations in HU rats may differ in functionally different vascular beds within the same part of the body. This was shown in studies of vascular dimensions and reactivity of arterioles from postural (soleus) and phasic (gastrocnemius) hindlimb muscles (Delp et al., 2000), as well as arterioles from white (glycolytic) and red (oxidative) parts from the same gastrocnemius muscle (Heaps and Bowles, 2002) of HU rats. Obviously, such diverse effects of HU on the arterial vasculature within and among postural and phasic muscles are largely the result of differential alterations in muscle activity and blood flow during the conditions of disuse (McDonald et al., 1992).Structural and functional changes in the vascular bed could also result from the influence of sympathetic nervous system. In addition to acute control of vessel diameter and blood flow, neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves exert a trophic effect on the vasculature (Bevan, 1984;Puzdrova et al., 2014;Adeoye et al., 2015). The severity of trophic sympathetic influence in certain vascular bed may depend on the density of its innervation and/or on the efferent sympathetic traffic it receives. In addition, the state of the vascular neuroeffector apparatus has been shown to depend on the prevailing level of transmural pressure and, therefore, may be affected in the conditions of microgravity (Monos et al., 2001;Zhang, 2001;Puzdrova et al., 2009).In contrast to the skeletal muscle circulation, the cutaneous circulation is regulated by a smaller contribution from metabolic vasomotor mechanisms and a higher role of sympathetic control, including a greater sympathetic vasoconstriction of small cutaneous arteries relative to that in skeletal muscle (Tarasova et al., 2003). However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the effects of simulated microgravityviaHU on the structural and functional properties of cutaneous arteries, nor contrasted these effects in the forelimb and hindlimb circulations. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that HU exerts diverse effects on the neurovascular density, structural properties, and functional vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle and cutaneous feed arteries in the rat forelimb and hindlimb regions."

Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, DNA methylome, transcriptome, epigenetic clock",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe spaceflight environment contains two major risk factors, irradiation and microgravity, which are thought to induce adverse effects on astronauts’ vision and central nervous systems,1–4and in particular, the eye and retina.5,6Studies reported that more than 30% of astronauts returning from Space Shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) were diagnosed with eye problems that reduced visual acuity.3,7Furthermore, a recent study showed that spaceflight induced significant apoptosis in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of mice.8Previous work has also shown that many genes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondria-associated apoptosis are altered in the retinas of space-flown mice, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays an important role in response to space irradiation in mouse retinas.9–11Previous research on space-induced visual impairment in astronauts has primarily utilized proteomics and microarray technologies to better understand the biological effects of spaceflight on the mouse retina; these studies collectively reveal that spaceflight alters the expression of certain genes and proteins involved in cell death, mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neuronal and glial cell loss, and axonal degeneration in mice.9,12Although there are studies analyzing the transcriptome in human retinas, none has been done under spaceflight conditions.13–16Thus, the mechanisms underlying the spaceflight-induced vision impairment remain largely unknown. Even though spaceflight-induced transcriptomic reprogramming in mouse retinas was recently reported,17there has been no study of the effects of spaceflight on the retina methylome or the epigenetic clocks of animals or humans.There is great enthusiasm both within the scientific community and society in general with the ambitious plans for the return of manned missions to the moon and long-duration (>300 days) space travel to Mars and beyond. However, a comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects on the human body is still incomplete. In a recent NASA Twins Study, some persistent changes in gene expression, DNA damage, telomeres, neuro-ocular and cognitive function were observed when comparing the spaceflight twin brother to his earth-bound twin.18It has also been shown that long-duration spaceflight changes gene regulation at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, although the majority of these changes return to the preflight level six months after returning to earth. As part of a NASA research consortium to accelerate spaceflight risk characterization and to gather omics data to allow robust predictions of cellular response in organisms exposed to long-duration spaceflight, we investigated the DNA methylome, epigenetic clock and transcriptome of retinas from mice flown on a long-duration 37-day mission, the human equivalent of 4.1 years, as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project. We identified differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflight and ground control mice. In addition, as epigenetic clocks have been used to predict tissue biological ages and age-related diseases in both humans19and mice20,21, we calculated spaceflight-induced epigenetic clock based on the DNA methylation at unique CpG sites of mouse retinas to predict the retinal tissue aging due to the spaceflight. This study provides new insights into the visual impairment due to long-duration spaceflight."

Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.\nKeywords:\nVestibular, motion detection, spatial orientation, gravity perception",

However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species.\nKeywords:\nvestibular, sensory convergence, brainstem",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe middle ear contains the three auditory ossicles—the malleus, incus, and stapes—which sequentially conduct sound by transmitting sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the fluid in the cochlea via the oval window of the otic capsule, the bony case enclosing the cochlea and vestibular system. In the otic capsule, the vibrations are converted into electrical signals and transduced to the brain via auditory nerves [1]. Abnormal morphological changes of the bone structures in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule may disturb sound transmission and cause conductive hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction.The auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, unlike most bones in the skull that form through intramembranous ossification, develop like long bones through endochondral ossification. In this process an initial cartilage template is subsequently replaced by bone while the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes and the calcified cartilage matrix are removed by osteoclasts (bone modeling phase) [2,3]. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with osteoclast defects results in osteopetrotic phenotype of these bones, significantly affecting their morphology and function [4]. However, unlike long bones, no significant bone remodeling (a coupled process of osteoclastic bone resorption with subsequent osteoblastic formation) occurs in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule after development [5]. Turnover of the otic capsule in regions surrounding the perilymph spaces is about 0.13% per year compared to 10% for the long bones [6]. This low bone remodeling rate in the otic capsule is due to high levels of secreted osteoprotegerin (OPG) [7,8], a major negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and consequent bone resorption. By binding RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand) [9], OPG acts as a decoy receptor and prevents RANKL-RANK interactions and the downstream RANK-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation that is critical for initiation of osteoclast differentiation. InOpg−/−mice, massive erosion of auditory ossicles and the otic capsule by unchecked osteoclasts leads to compensatory abnormal osteogenesis, causing fixation of the stapes and consequent progressive hearing loss due [10,11].In humans, reduced OPG in the otic capsule is associated with otosclerosis [12,13], a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone at one or more foci within the middle ear or inner ear that often leads to hearing loss in patients. Otosclerosis develops initially through a first phase of bone resorption by activated osteoclasts and increased vascularization (the otospongiosis phase), followed by new bone deposition from osteoblasts and mineralization (the otosclerosis phase) [13]. The prevalence of otosclerosis is high in Caucasians compared to patients of African descent and higher in women than men [14]. The etiology of otosclerosis is not well understood, but both genetic and environmental factors, including measles virus infection, hormonal changes during pregnancy and middle ear inflammation, have been postulated to contribute. Family linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci associated with otosclerosis, yet none of the otosclerosis causing genes within these regions has been identified so far [15–17]. Nevertheless, mutations inSERPINF1orMEPEhave been recently associated with familial otosclerosis [18,19]. Given that maintaining OPG level is fundamental to the prevention of bone turnover in the middle and inner ear and the consequent development of otosclerosis, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulates OPG expression will provide clues regarding the underlying biological basis of the disease.In this study, we demonstrate a role for the L-type CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the regulation of OPG expression in the middle and inner ear. The CaV1.2 channel is widely distributed and mediates Ca2+influx into the cell upon membrane depolarization. The entry of Ca2+causes a transient increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which serves as a second messenger and mediates critical physiological roles in many organs, including cardiac muscle contraction, hormone secretion in endocrine tissues, postsynaptic responses in various 5 neurons, and activation of gene expression paradigms [20]. However, its role in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was not previously reported. The CaV1.2 channel is composed of multiple subunits: α1C, β, and α2δ [21]. The α1Csubunit is the ion-conducting pore while the β and α2δ are auxiliary subunits that modulate channel properties [22]. Most studies focused on CaV1.2 function in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where frequent and dynamic changes in membrane potential facilitate activation of the voltage-gated channel, with little attention to potential contributions of the channel in non-excitable cells. Studies of Timothy syndrome (TS), a multiorgan disorder caused byde novogain-of-function missense mutations in the α1C-encodingCACNA1Cgene [23,24], revealed critical but previously unappreciated roles for CaV1.2 in many non-excitable cells. We and others demonstrated that CaV1.2 was expressed in osteoblast progenitors during long bone development and homeostasis [25–27]. Moreover, in anin vitroMC3T3-E1 cell and a primary calvaria organ culture system, Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2 regulated OPG expression [28]. Pharmacological blocking of CaV1.2 channel activity with nifedipine reduced the level of OPG expression and secretion [28]. Consistent with those findings, we exploited the TS-causing mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) to increase Ca2+signaling specifically in osteoblasts or their progenitors and observed inhibited osteoclast activity in long bones through upregulated OPG expression and secretion [25].Given its ability to modulate the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway, we hypothesized that CaV1.2 could also affect bone modeling in the ear. Here, we show that increased Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2TSexpressed in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule affected bone modeling/remodeling as well as auditory and vestibular function. Defining the role of Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2 in the physiological regulation of osteoclast formation offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other bony disorders of the ear and provides clues for future explorations of therapeutic strategies or prevention of hearing loss caused by bony structural changes in the middle and inner ear."

Although longer chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.\nKeywords:\nOligodendrocytes, myelination, simulated microgravity, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe long-term effects of the space environment on the central nervous system (CNS) still remain largely unknown. Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiological adaptation. In particular, neuro-psycho-physiological health deserves special attention to ensure successful long-term space missions. In recent years, studies have started to address neural function and behavior in space. It has been reported that cerebellar, sensorimotor, and vestibular brain areas seem to be the most affected [1]. Microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure; nonetheless, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90° degrees seated upright posture on Earth. Instead, the basal levels over 24 h in microgravity pressure in the brain are slightly higher than those on Earth, which may cause the remodeling of the eye in astronauts [2]. Moreover, a space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) has been recently described [3]. At the cellular level, it has been shown that microgravity induces apoptosis, alters the cytoskeleton, and affects the differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic status in different cells [4]. Nonetheless, only a few aspects regarding the sensitivity of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in microgravity have been reported. An interesting article from Silvano and collaborators [5] showed that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to simulated microgravity by the arrest of their cell cycle in S-phase and enhanced apoptosis. They also found that these changes were transient and upon return to normal gravity (1 G) these cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle.The objective of the present study was to determine how the space environment influences human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs, their biology, and their fate choice capability toward the neuronal phenotype."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionTo determine the health risks associated with long-term space travel, it is essential to consider the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on the brain. It is well-established that astronauts oftentimes experience adverse effects following a visit to outer space including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-recognized spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. Potential risk factors as well as limitations to lengthy space missions and stays at the International Space Station (ISS) are posed by SANS, among other difficulties that astronauts face due to the gravitational differences in space. This is particularly important because issues such as SANS can be experienced after as little as 34 days, and unusual pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings have been shown after both short- and long-term space travel [2].Many studies on the use of microgravity have been performed using an array of cells both committed to a specific phenotype depending on the organ of study as well as uncommitted cells known as stem cells. The origin of stem cells includes murine and human origin. Among these are adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and organ-specific stem cells [3]. Recent publications have described changes in stem cells when exposed to simulated or space microgravity. Nonetheless, there is limited information in what concerns neural stem cells. Prior research looking at the effects of microgravity on neural stem cells has primarily been conducted with the use of simulated microgravity (sim-µG). Sim-µG studies use machines that are able to simulate low gravity conditions such as the Mitsubishi 3D-Clinostat [4]. The use of different microgravity platforms with application on stem cells and differentiated cells has recently been reviewed [3]. Only a few studies have shown the effect of sim-µG or SPC-µG specifically on neural stem cells. In this regard, Silvano and collaborators have shown that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to sim-µG by the arrest of their cell cycle in the S-phase with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. These changes occurred in a transient manner because upon return to 1G (Earth’s gravity), the authors described that the cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle [5]. We have previously reported a result that appears to contradict Silvano et al.’s findings, where we found that NSCs in sim-µG proliferated more and displayed a smaller diameter than 1G grown NSCs [6]. A recent discovery that spaceflight upregulated proliferation and survival genes in neural crest derived stem cells while the random positioning machine upregulated differentiation and inflammation genes emphasized the uniqueness of space flight conditions when compared to Earth controls [7].Our current research avoids the use of sim-µG and moves directly to the source of microgravity -- outer space. SPC-µG has demonstrated more pronounced effects of certain phenomena when compared to sim-µG [8]. Although radiation and other environmental differences cannot be excluded as contributing factors, the findings are similar between sim-µG and SPC-µG, save for the difference in degree [8].The results of the current study provide outcomes not previously reported in sim-µG studies, with the additional benefit of added relevance to the astronauts’ health. Here, four conditions of NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) are considered. In the ground control condition (1G), NSCs did not experience any SPC-µG, although other cellular conditions were the same as the experimental groups (more details on the procedure are available inSection 2). The second group consisted of 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown NSCs that were treated with the secretome, which is our term for the secreted medium from space-flown cells. Finally, we also looked at two groups of NSCs following space flight, with the first group captured one week post-flight, and the final group captured at two weeks post-flight.Due to the nature of the study looking at abnormalities in cell division, it is important to understand the intricacies of the cell cycle and the potential stage(s) for error. In the case of one of the abnormalities, we deemed incomplete cell division (ICD) as failed cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is a highly complex, regulated process that requires an extensive number of cellular processes, proteins, and signaling factors to function properly. Cytokinetic failure can occur due to defects in any of its four stages, which include positioning of the division plane, ingression of the cleavage furrow, formation of the midbody, and abscission [9]. Cytokinetic failure following the division of the cell nucleus, or karyokinesis, can result in a tetraploid cell with double nuclei and four copies of each chromosome rather than the expected two. For some cells of the human body such as in the heart or liver, tetraploidy is a normal process [9]. However, in many cases, tetraploidy can be a sign of a deleterious abnormality such as a tumor precursor [10].Previous work in the literature has confirmed that embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells behave similarly in terms of cell cycle components. Embryonic stem cell pluripotency is maintained through unique and highly specific signaling. These cells enter the S phase more rapidly with a shortened G1 due to impaired or atypical checkpoint control in embryonic stem cells and unusual activation patterns [11].Our previous findings showed that NSCs proliferate at a higher rate while in space as well as up to 72 h following space flight, irrespective of flight duration [2,4]. We also showed that changes in the cell diameter occurred post-flight, with 81% of NSCs exhibiting a diameter of 10 µm or higher following space flight compared to 49.2% of the control NSCs [4]. While the undifferentiated NSCs in adult human brain areas such as the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus remain quiescent under normal circumstances, the environment of SPC-µG exposure is likely to alter the expected behavior of these cells [12]. The changes described above including increased proliferation and enlarged cell diameter [13] could contribute to symptoms of SANS that astronauts experience post-flight such as intracranial hypertension. Here, in addition to the aforementioned differences, we noticed that some SPC-µG NSCs appeared to have difficulties with the completion of cytokinesis with enough frequency to be of interest for further investigation. The current study takes a closer look at proliferation abnormalities in single cell division. Throughout this paper, the term ICD refers to an ultimate failure of cytokinesis, regardless of whether karyokinesis has occurred, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) refers to the appearance of more than two daughter cells as would be typical for a single cell division following cytokinesis. The term abnormal cell division (ACD) refers to either phenomena, ICD and/or MDCD. We investigated the hypothesis that, compared to 1G NSCs, there are significantly increased instances of ICD, MDCD, and ACD following exposure to SPC-µG. We also hypothesized that the space-produced secretome would have a similar effect on naïve NSCs."

The central nervous system (CNS) is a complex system that governs voluntary and involuntary functions and behaviors. It is continually adapting to challenges from the environment to sustain its functions. We have previously reported that oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, proliferate more in simulated microgravity (Sim-µG) and after exposure to it [1]. We have also reported that sim-µG enhances energy metabolism in OLPs [2]. The first goal of this investigation was to ascertain if human OLPs flown to space would proliferate more after space flight. We hypothesized that OLPs would have increased proliferation while in space and that this could be contributing to ICP and VIIP in astronauts that have flown to space because the symptoms do not disappear with time back on Earth.These findings led us to investigate (i) if space microgravity would produce similar results and (ii) how OLPs adapt to the Earth’s gravity after space flight. For this purpose, we used time-lapse imaging and analysis.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionNumerous studies have shown that in normal mammalian cells grown in culture, microgravity induces an array of phenomena such as apoptosis and changes in their cytoskeleton, as well as in signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion. Effects differ depending on the cell type [1]. Microgravity also alters differentiation and augments apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells [2,3] and alters breast cancer-derived cells [4]. Microgravity is thus considered as a platform to study the metabolism of normal, developing, mature and cancerous cells, as well as the potential pharmacological approaches to treat, on Earth, neurodegeneration, developmental disabilities and cancer.We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) using the “the 3D-clinostat” robot (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on neural cells and, in particular, neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are essential for the efficient synthesis and maintenance of myelin [5,6]. They form the compact segments of the myelin membrane that coil around the axon and allow for the saltatory conduction of action potentials, ensuring the healthy functioning of the CNS. Neurological diseases involving this cell type are characterized by myelin loss and an impairment in nerve conduction. A lack of or damaged myelin is debilitating and disabling because the nerve impulses slow down or even stop, causing neurological deficits. Understanding how OL progenitors (OLPs) differentiate and form myelin sheaths around nerve axons is of interest for the prevention and treatment of myelin-associated diseases. In many cases, OLPs fail to mature and, therefore, they cannot remyelinate axons in dys- and de-myelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease or after a traumatic injury. Moreover, a chronic lack of myelin leads to axonal transection [7].As neurological impairments have been observed after human space journeys, e.g., intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), we have studied in previous papers the effects of artificial microgravity on cultured OLPs. Our first study using BrdU revealed that rodent and human OLPs displayed enhanced and sustained proliferation while they were in sim-µG with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. Moreover, these cells appeared to remember having been in µG and continued to proliferate more after having been placed in Earth’s gravity [8].More recently, we studied the effects of space-µG on OLPs and found enhanced proliferation [9], yet some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis [10]. Moreover, based on the expression of stage-specific developmental markers, we discovered that these cells came back in a more immature stage than that of the ground control OLPs [10]. Here we sought to determine A) the impact of space flight on the global metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs while in space-µG in order to start unraveling extracellular processes, as well as identifying gravitational-sensitive molecules, and B) the energetic status of OLPs after space flight. We found the presence of some gravitational-sensitive molecules, as well as enhanced energy and glutamate metabolism in the secretome generated while the OLPs were on board the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, we found an elevated energy demand in the OLPs upon return to Earth, which led to an increased use of glycolysis to support their energy demands.In previous decades, we have studied and developed culture conditions for OLs and their precursors using biochemical, histochemical and morphological signals [11,12]. Key features of OLs are their well-defined developmental stages characterized by the expression of numerous stage-specific markers from which their expression is either transient or permanent throughout the life of these cells. These markers also define the functions that OLs support, including the production and secretion of the iron carrier glycoprotein transferrin for its autocrine and paracrine use in CNS iron metabolism, as well as the synthesis of all myelin components when OLs mature until they reach the myelinating stage. These stages and markers have been reported and reviewed by us and other scientists [5,13,14]. For the purpose of understanding the contents of the secretome produced by space-flown OLPs, here we use our previous description of these developmental stages [15,16] (Supplementary Figure S1)."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe increasing duration of space missions and consequent need to adapt to the inhospitable conditions of the space environment present new challenges to astronauts. The health and safety of present and future space travelers remains paramount. Long periods of exposure to µG may have detrimental effects on tissues and their regenerative potential, partly due to changes observed in stem cell populations [1,2]. In particular, the human brain suffers alterations in the structure and electrocortical function induced by microgravity (µG). These alterations manifest when the space crew returns to Earth as problems with motor coordination increase intracranial pressure, and a vestibular system containing otoliths is unable to sense the presence of gravity [3,4,5]. At the cellular level, Silvano et al. reported transient cell cycle arrest and cellular stress followed by apoptosis on murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs). The cells recovered their normal cell cycle and stemness upon returning to normal gravity [6]. Our own studies and those from other groups have shown an increase in cell proliferation and metabolic activity of human NSCs on a spaceflight or under simulated µG (sim- µG), in part due to an increase in mitochondrial function [7,8]. Mattei et al. studied early brain development under simulated µG using human embryonic stem cell-derived neural organoids. Although the organoids were able to form, they reported alterations in the rostral-caudal patterning, indicating that µG favors differentiation toward caudal neural progenitors [9].The impact of a lack of gravitational force on biological systems can be observed soon after the exposure begins. After a 24 h incubation in a sim-µG, a human seminoma cell line exhibited markers of oxidative stress, such as enlarged mitochondria and increased intracellular ROS, protein and lipid oxidation, and SOD [10]. Human gastric mucosal cells showed signs of stress and inflammation following 3 days of sim-µG, whereas oxidative stress on the same cells was detected after 7 days of exposure to microgravity [11]. Our own studies on fetal human NSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) revealed increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after exposing OLPs to sim-µG for 3 days increased the TCA cycle and the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids [12]. A more detailed study on mitochondrial function in rat hippocampus was performed by Wang et al., following 7 days in a tail suspension model of microgravity. They found downregulation in mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV, in isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases, as well as upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes PRX6 and DJ-1 [13].In this study, we sought to ascertain “gravity sensitive” small molecules secreted by NSCs after short-term exposure to space µG. Our results demonstrate that µG increases energy production, mainly through the TCA cycle, and triggers stress response mechanisms as means for adaptation."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.\nSubject terms:\nNeuroscience, Human behaviour",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionFuture exploration class space expeditions will be some of the most difficult, dangerous, and dynamic operations in the history of mankind, ranging from Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration. They will push the limits of human performance and critically rely on the integrity of a range of organ systems and functions. With the advent of longer spaceflight missions space agencies have recognized the importance of better understanding the effects of environmental, operational, and psychological hazards during exploratory class missions on brain and behavior. The potential damage to neural structures in response to spaceflight and its behavioral implications are not well understood. At the same time adverse behavioral conditions, psychiatric disorders, and sensorimotor deficits are considered some of the most serious but also least understood risks during future long-duration space missions. Many other spaceflight risks are ranked lower or have been mitigated. In addition to the physiological effects of microgravity, the spacecraft setting can involve exposure to multiple environmental toxicants and operational stressors1that all have the potential to affect neurobehavioral performance (Fig.1). Behavioral health and performance are governed by an interplay between the central nervous system (CNS), the environment and individual phenotypes that is characterized by constantly updating and balancing genetic, molecular, cellular, physiological and cognitive demands and resources. The CNS, and particularly the brain, have emerged as a pivotal area of research because of their vulnerability to various spaceflight stressors. There is increasing evidence that spaceflight is associated with various adaptations of the brain, including intracranial fluid shifts, gray matter changes, white matter declines, and sensory reweighting and neural compensation2. However, the exact changes in brain structure and function and their meaning and mechanisms, as well as the role of mission duration, sex, and phenotypic vulnerabilities are unknown. Likewise, data on the implications of brain changes relative to behavioral and operational risks are lacking. Given that errors, misjudgments, and accidents may have serious consequences, and can lead to loss of expensive equipment and compromise mission success, identifying and predicting the effects of spaceflight on human performance and understanding their neural correlates and molecular fingerprints will be critical for successful future exploration class missions3,4.Fig. 1.

The brain that orchestrates all processes is at the center of these concentric circles. Gray lines indicate the mutual interdependencies between omics, cells, molecules, integrative physiology, and their neurobehavioral signatures.This exercise has been incepted by the Science Department of ESA’s Human Spaceflight and Exploration Directorate. In 2020, ESA released a Call for Ideas for evolution of the SciSpacE Roadmaps in the post 2024 era. The overarching objective of the call was to engage the European research community in refining the focus areas for the SciSpacE Human Research Roadmaps, particularly for the post 2024 period. Following an initial screening of the materials submitted, ESA appointed experts across Europe to set up several working groups reflecting relevant organ systems and human research areas for spaceflight. Each working group was self-organized and expected to present its summary at a meeting organized by ESA in late 2020. In 2021 preliminary reports were published by ESA for a further community consultation and review. Pooling the combined expertise of ESA with the scientific community and stakeholders across Europe led to the identification of four major future roadmaps including Behavioral Health & Performance (including Neuroscience & Psychology), Human Physiology, Pharmacological Countermeasures, and Integrative Countermeasures. Leveraging the outcomes of previous similar exercises (e.g., THESEUS) as well as opening up the knowledge-building process to the scientific community across disciplines, it has been possible to clearly define gaps and risks that are currently considered highly critical but unmitigated in space science and technology. The process of creating the roadmaps has involved hundreds of individuals from the wider life science and engineering communities, ESA and international partners. This strategy allowed to maximize cross-disciplinary synergies (interactions between working groups were strongly encouraged as of the start of the project). The outcome of this work has been summarized in a series of papers presented by each working group. The current manuscript highlights the ESA SciSpaceE research gaps identified in the field of Neuroscience as part of the Behavioral Health & Performance Roadmap; the Psychology expert group provided additional feedback on some aspects at the boundary between neuroscience and psychology. In the following sections, we identify and discuss some key knowledge gaps related to neurobehavioral performance during human future exploration space missions. Next, we address potential countermeasures to mitigate these risks. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs, and how addressing these knowledge gaps can benefit people and industrial applications on Earth."

        "Title": "Spaceflight Induces Specific Alterations in the Proteomes of Arabidopsis",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLife in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionPlants undergosubstantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgraveet al.,1997; Wolffet al.,2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Linket al.,2001; Paulet al.,2001,2005,2012b,2013; Stutteet al.,2006; Salmi and Roux,2008; Salmiet al.,2011; Correllet al.,2013; Nasiret al.,2014; Sugimotoet al.,2014).However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazarset al.,2014). The distribution of differentially abundant proteins among three treatments (microgravity of the ISS, a 1gorbital centrifuge, and a 1gground control) highlights familiar pathways in gravity signal transduction. Many of the membrane-associated proteins involved in auxin signaling cascades were less prominent in microgravity-grown plants, while many proteins typically associated with stress responses were more abundant. While there is not a one-to-one correlation with any gene set from a published spaceflight transcriptome, similar trends in the differential expression of genes important to auxin metabolism, and to a variety of stress responses, can be seen in the transcription profiles from several studies (see citations above). A proteomic survey in terrestrial altered-gravity environments also revealed a host of general stress proteins as well as those associated with auxin signaling (Tanet al.,2011). Although there is little specific overlap with transcriptome studies of plants exposed to similar environments, many of the trends in pathways affected by spaceflight are similar among the studies (Moseykoet al.,2002; Tanet al.,2011). With increased technical sensitivity and better access to space, the spaceflight responses contribute to a comprehensive picture of the strategies used by plants to cope with changes in their environment.Comparative proteomics mass spectrometry (MS) methods can be used to reveal quantitative changes in the protein complement of cells and organs over a large scale between and among samples. The use of iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification; Applied Biosystems) allows for quantitative comparisons of samples by labeling lysine residues and N-termini of peptides with mass reporter molecules, such that the samples can be combined into simultaneous analyses by MS. The relative amounts of every identified peptide from each sample are simultaneously revealed within the tandem mass spectra through the relative intensity of the differentially labeled ion peaks, enabling each peptide to be correlated to each sample through the mass of the reporter molecules. Several papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of iTRAQ analysis of Arabidopsis samples in the study of broad-scale proteomic changes (Zhaoet al.,2010; Alvarezet al.,2011; Schencket al.,2013; Liet al.,2014).The major scientific goal of this study was to discover proteomics changes that characterize the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment. To accomplish this goal, we sought to examine proteomics changes on an organ-specific level by comparing the proteomics of roots and leaves between plants grown in space and plants grown on Earth. The samples were from Arabidopsis seedlings from three green fluorescent protein (GFP) lines that were germinated on the ISS and grown for 12 days before being preserved in the strong protein denaturant RNAlater and then frozen. The nature of these samples, having been preserved in RNAlater primarily for gene expression analyses, necessitated the development of methods for protein extraction from RNAlater samples and the processing of small amounts of proteins through iTRAQ and MS analyses. Therefore, the secondary and technical goal of this study was to examine proteomics based on samples from this preservation method, which is widely used in ISS spaceflight biology research, to discern whether this form of preservation could enable broad-scale proteomics of spaceflight samples. The resulting data demonstrate the technical success of the approach and show significant spaceflight-induced proteomic changes that were different between roots and leaves. These proteomics data are discussed in the context of adaptive physiologies in space and are also discussed in relation to gene expression changes that have been seen in similar plants in space."

        "Title": "The effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of roots: GFP reporter gene microscopy on orbit.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOur primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of\nArabidopsis thaliana\n: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSince the times of the Darwins’ treatise on the power of movement in plants1and the experiments of Cholodny and Went2gravity has been established as central to many patterns of plant development.3–5Gravity-dependent changes in root growth direction are keyed by changes in the auxin distribution within the root tip. During gravistimulation, starch-containing amyloplasts migrate to the downward side of the root columella cells, initiating migration of PIN proteins that then cause asymmetric redistribution of auxin toward the lower side of the root, which in turn causes curvature in the elongation zone to reestablish the root into a vertical orientation.3,6–11This series of signaling events acts upon a well-characterized distribution of auxin that arises from a flow of auxin from the aerial portions of the plant through the central stele toward the root tip with an accumulation of auxin in the columella cells, which is then relieved by a flow back toward the aerial portions of the plant through the outer root cell layers. The movement and differential accumulation of auxin within specific root tip cells is known as the ‘reverse fountain’ model9,12–14(Figure 1a). It is this auxin accumulation and flow that forms the primary basis of the root’s ability to respond to gravity.10,15Implicit in model’s name is the notion that gravity establishes at least part of the pattern of distribution, just as drops from a water fountain fall after the propelling force is overcome by gravity. Most references to these gravity-driven responses compare “vertical” to “gravistimulated”, as if vertical is the ground state. The term vertical, defined as an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, inexorably creates an implicit relationship in which the fundamental auxin reverse fountain is established and oriented along the Earth’s gravity vector.Figure 1.Open in a new tabReverse Fountain model and DR5 distribution. (a) Reverse fountain model (after refs.13,14) shows the movement of auxin toward the tip of the root through the stele (red arrow), to be redirected in a symmetrical manner by polar transport (blue, then purple arrows) back toward the zone of elongation.

GFP, green fluorescent protein.We wished to know whether gravity has a direct physiologic role in establishing the auxin reverse fountain signaling system in primary roots. One of the major values of work on the ISS is the ability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. This allows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, for example, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing can be decoupled from the auxin flow.16–19We usedArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) lines expressing gravity signaling fluorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxin artificial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP)20as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip, especially in the central columella cells (C), and a Tryptophan Aminotransferase ofArabidopsisfusion (pTAA1::TAA1–GFP)21to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC). We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR–GFP),22to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatory role in auxin biosynthesis,11to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free-cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis Response Regulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarly distributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter (pARR5::GUS).23"

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nSkewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing.\nResults\nThis work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.\nConclusions\nThis study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root.

        "Title": "Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExperimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS,\nphyD\nplants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants, as much as any other complex eukaryotic organisms, mount specific transcriptional responses to an environment in order to accomplish physiological adaptation and survival in that environment. Heat shock, salt, cold, drought and hypoxia are among the most well studied environmental responses in plants, and mutant studies of these responses have been key to showing that a given aspect of the response is necessary and appropriate for survival (e.g. [1,2–8]). However, in each of these examples, the environmental stress was a part of the evolutionary history of plants and the development of a stress response for survival seems logically appropriate. Knocking out those appropriate responses has a negative effect on survival under that environmental stress (e.g. [9,10,11]), and manipulation of the response can modify the degree of stress that can be overcome (e.g. [12,13–15]). Spaceflight, however, presents an environmental situation that is well outside of the evolutionary history of plants, wherein plants have had no exposure to develop adaptive strategies, and this situation creates the possibility that environmental signals in spaceflight could be inappropriately activating non-adaptive responses.The possibility of non-adaptive responses to spaceflight presents an added dimension to the goal of understanding plant growth in space and the fundamental biological questions of adaptation to truly novel environments. What is the measure of successful adaptation to a new environment? Is it possible to gauge the impact of a novel environment on the basis of molecular responses? Can inappropriate responses be genetically removed, thereby reducing the transcriptome costs of developing appropriate adaptation responses? In this study, these questions were explored simply on the basis of measuring the intensity and complexity of the patterns of differential gene expression in response to spaceflight in different genotypes. The data presented here look at a very specific set of cells–the last 2 mm of the primary root of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which represents the primary gravity-sensing region of the plant root (e.g. [16,17]. These data compared specific genotypes in order to dissect the spaceflight responses of plants as they germinated and continued their development on the International Space Station. These plants were not undergoing transitional physiological adaptation to a new environment, but rather, from the moment of germination, they experienced an environment that is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism.This study therefore identifies the genes engaged by the cells of the root tip in the spaceflight environment compared to similar plants on the ground, and then asks how variations in genetic background, and the lighting sub-environment on the International Space Station, impact the differential expression of genes.The experimental design extrapolates primarily from the APEX01 (Advanced Plant Experiment 01) Arabidopsis spaceflight experiment. APEX01 illustrated that during spaceflight in microgravity, Arabidopsis plants utilized the gradient of light established in the growth hardware to orient the directional axis of growth, and demonstrated unique, genotype-specific patterns of root growth [18,19]. On the ground, the roots grew vertically down the surface of the plate, but surprisingly, so did the roots on orbit, but not straight “down” in a negatively phototropic direction; the roots instead progressed in a distinctive skewing pattern, such as seen on Earth when grown on tilted surfaces (e.g. [20]. The skewing growth pattern was interesting from the perspective that skewing was long thought to require gravity, but also from the perspective that the two genotypes flown–Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia-0 (Col-0)–exhibited distinctly different skewing morphometrics, which were enhanced over what was typical on the ground. WS and Col-0 are genotypically distinct and therefore possess potentially different tools to respond to any given set of environments [21,22]. Spaceflight studies by Blancaflor and colleagues demonstrated that Col-0 skews more dramatically in the dark than in the light, and that genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton can impact root morphology in microgravity [23,24]. Spaceflight studies by Kiss and colleagues established that the interplay of specific wavelengths of light and manipulation of light-receptor genes can have a dramatic impact on the morphology of seedling growth in microgravity and fractional gravity, and have shown that the Arabidopsis cultivar Landsberg also exhibits skewing [25–29]. Light plays a larger role in root behavior in the spaceflight environment, and nuanced impact of the genomic background appears to be more easily revealed when gravity is not the dominant tropic force acting on the plant.Among the genes that differ between WS and Col-0 is phytochrome D (PhyD), which encodes a PHYB-like member of the family. PHYD appears to work in conjunction with PHYB for shade avoidance in terrestrial habitats [30,31], but appears to have virtually no role in gravitropism [32]. However, although WS lacks PhyD transcription it does contain normal levels of PhyA, PhyB, and PhyC [30]. There is considerable overlap in the roles of the members of the phytochrome family, but a mutation in PhyD in a Col-0 background mimics some of the phenotypic features of the WS ecotype (e.g. [33]). The role of PhyD in shade avoidance, and also its lack of a role in gravity sensing, contributed to our interest in the gene, but the fact that the deletion of a single, seemingly inconsequential gene in Col-0 could also phenocopy features of the wild-type WS cultivar was especially intriguing, and led us to choose the Col-0phyDline for inclusion in a transcriptome comparison of the wild type WS and Col-0 genotypes in the spaceflight environment.The experiment described here examined the influence of genotype on the physiological adaptation to spaceflight as measured by gene expression patterns. RNAseq transcriptome profiling provided the metric by which to measure the impact of the environment, and address whether it is possible to eliminate all or part of the spaceflight response by manipulating the genotype of the plant."

Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from two\nArabidopsis thaliana\necotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant differential alternative splicing. This study provides the first evidence of a role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionDuring growth on the International Space Station (ISS), plants encounter a suite of abiotic stressors largely owing to the effects of microgravity, cosmic radiation, and other less-characterized stresses associated with the spaceflight environment. Similar to observations made in response to terrestrial plant stresses, exposure to the spaceflight environment triggers a unique transcriptional response.1–4Patterns of spaceflight-induced gene expression have been analyzed in a variety of experiments carried out onboard the ISS, with focus on dissecting the transcriptome at the resolution of individual genes rather than transcript isoforms.1–4Alternative splicing (AS) is the phenomenon by which exons and introns can be differentially joined together to result in the production of multiple distinct transcript isoforms derived from a single parent gene locus (reviewed in ref.5). AS greatly enhances the diversity of the eukaryotic transcriptome. In the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, as many as 60% of intron-containing genes undergo AS.6In addition, unique AS patterns arise in response to terrestrial plant stressors.5,7–11To investigate the role of AS during spaceflight adaptation in plants, RNA sequencing data collected during the APEX03 experiment fromA. thalianaseedlings grown on board the ISS in comparison to seedlings grown as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline specifically developed to be aware of AS events (adapted from ref.12).The APEX03 experiment featured two differentA. thalianaecotypes, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS), and involved RNA sequencing of root tissue from both 4- and 8-day-old seedlings grown on 10 cm2petri plates containing Phytagel then preserved in RNALater on orbit. These time points were chosen because by 8 days of growthArabidopsisseedlings will transition to photosynthesizing using true leaves, which is a major shift during seedling development. Root morphological differences between Col-0 and WS cultivars have been studied in spaceflight previously: Col-0 is known to exhibit much weaker root skewing in microgravity, compared to the strong rightward root skewing observed in the WS ecotype.13Following RNA sequencing, the raw reads were processed using a bioinformatics pipeline designed to analyze the transcriptome with resolution at the level of individual transcript isoforms (Fig.1a) (adapted from ref.12). This pipeline differs from standard pipelines utilized to assess differential gene expression in that three distinct transcript assembly programs are used to maximize the robustness of transcript isoform discovery.12Presence/absence variation (PAV) of AS isoforms was then performed utilizing extremely stringent criteria to identify the expression level differences in AS isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls. To count an AS isoform as present in each condition, the isoform was required to be expressed at an FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) ≥10 in all four biological replicates of a given condition and was required to come from a parent gene that undergoes AS as identified by the pipeline used in this analysis. By using a high FPKM value as a strict expression level cutoff and eliminating results with biological variation, lists of AS isoforms strongly present in each condition were generated with high confidence (Supplementary Data File1). Consequentially, AS isoforms considered absent in each condition may not be entirely absent but rather not expressed at a high enough level to be classified as present in this analysis. This PAV analysis resulted in the identification of AS isoforms with expression-level differences between spaceflight and ground control samples in both ecotypes and developmental stages tested (Fig.1b). Orthogonal validation of AS isoforms counted as present or absent was performed by re-aligning the RNA sequencing reads to the reference genome utilizing a separate alignment program. Sequencing depth and splice junction coverage were then assessed using Integrative Genomics Viewer14to experimentally validate a subset of the isoforms counted as present or absent in each condition (Supplementary Fig.1–4). PAV analysis therefore enabled the identification of AS isoforms with expression-level differences in spaceflight, which reflects behavior of the transcriptional machinery within the cell.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabDetection of spaceflight-induced alternatively spliced transcript isoforms.aBioinformatics pipeline utilized to identify all transcript isoforms and significantly differentially spliced genes present in the original RNA sequencing dataset. Steps inside the dashed outline were performed on each individual replicate. See Methods for more detail on gtf merging.bComparison of alternatively spliced isoforms present or absent in spaceflight in both ecotypes and developmental ages tested.cCount of differentially alternatively spliced genes and the associated count of transcript isoforms observed in each condition.dComparison of the differentially alternatively spliced genes observed in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) or the Wassilewskija (WS) ecotype background. Differentially alternatively spliced genes observed at both 4- and 8-day time points in either ecotype background were pooled for this analysis. (C Columbia-0, W Wassilewskija, 4 4 days of age, 8 8 days of age. C4 Columbia-0 4 days of age, W8 Wassilewskija 8 days of age)Specific genes that undergo significant differential AS (dAS) were identified using CuffDiff15to investigate whether decisions made by the splicing machinery differ in response to spaceflight. In both ecotypes and both developmental stages tested in this analysis, genes that undergo significant dAS between spaceflight and ground control samples were identified (Fig.1c). Genes were identified as dAS if the isoform ratio differs significantly between the conditions examined (Supplementary Data File2). A difference in isoform ratio between conditions is indicative of a difference in splicing decision between conditions, which is independent of transcription-level differences.Interestingly, fewer genes undergo dAS in the Col-0 ecotype background collectively as compared to WS, which is opposite of the pattern observed in the literature between these two ecotypes regarding differentially expressed genes.2Comparison of the genes that undergo dAS in either the Col-0 or the WS background reveals very little overlap in the identity of the genes alternatively spliced in response to spaceflight (Fig.1d). Furthermore, gene ontology analysis does not reveal any obvious conclusions regarding the function or localization of the genes undergoing AS during spaceflight exposure.An example of dAS between spaceflight and ground controls in both Col-0 and WS is presented as an Integrative Genomics Viewer14image that visualizes differences in sequencing coverage between AS isoforms of the gene AT2G33770 (Fig.2a). This gene locus produces three AS transcript isoforms that utilize the same transcription start site—TCONS_00029094, TCONS_00029095, and TCONS_00029096. One AS isoform, TCONS_00029094, is only very lowly expressed in all conditions tested. However, AS isoform TCONS_00029095 is more common in spaceflight samples, whereas AS isoform TCONS_00029096 is more common in ground control samples (Fig.2a, b). This example highlights a difference in pre-mRNA processing in response to spaceflight—a spliceosome-specific behavior as opposed to a difference in transcription.Fig. 2.Open in a new tabVisualization of switch in isoform ratio between spaceflight and ground controls for gene AT2G33770.aScreenshot from Integrative Genomics Viewer16displaying sequencing coverage spanning the AT2G33770 gene model in spaceflight and ground control samples from either the 4-day Columbia-0 (Col-0) or 8-day Wassilewskija (WS) backgrounds.

Isoform ratio was calculated by FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads)This study represents the first observation of transcriptome-wide spaceflight-induced AS not only in plants but also in any living organism yet exposed to microgravity. The results presented here serve as strong evidence that AS has a role during the molecular adaptation process to the spaceflight environment in higher eukaryotic organisms such as plants and provides methods that can be used to identify AS isoforms from RNA sequencing datasets generated from other spaceflight-exposed organisms. However, the full role of AS during spaceflight adaptation must still be investigated by examining changes in the abundance of AS isoforms present in both conditions, the types of AS events occurring in spaceflight, and the functional implications of AS isoforms present or absent in spaceflight. In addition, it would be interesting to analyze the overlap between spaceflight differentially expressed genes and spaceflight-induced AS isoforms. Dissecting the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with both gene- and AS isoform-level resolution will elucidate better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leveraged by plants to adapt to the radically novel environment, that is, spaceflight."

        "Title": "The Plant Health Monitoring System of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 experiment phase",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m\n2\ncultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m\n2*\ns) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m\n2\n, which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m\n2*\nd). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season.\nKeywords:\nbio-regenerative life support system (BLSS), plant cultivation chamber, space plant growth facility, space food and nutrition, space analog studies, controlled environment agriculture (CEA)",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionFood production during human space missions to and on Moon and Mars is a necessary step to reduce resupply mass from Earth and thus long-term mission costs. Growing plants for food production also offers the advantages of producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as the recycling of water. Because of these advantages, experiments in growing plants in space began as early as the first manned space stations and continue to the present day (Zabel et al., 2016a).Several research teams conducted experiments in cultivating plants in a closed controlled environment on Earth for the application in future space missions in the past (Wheeler, 2017). Notable are NASA’s Biomass Production Chamber (Wheeler et al., 2003;Dreschel et al., 2018), the Russian BIOS facilities (Gitelson et al., 2003), the Japanese Closed Ecology Experimental Facility (Nitta, 2005) and the Chinese Lunar Palace 1 (Fu et al., 2016).The EDEN ISS project is the newest space greenhouse analog project to test subsystems, technologies, operation procedures, plant health monitoring devices and plant cultivation for future space missions. The EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility (MTF) (Figure 1) was setup in Antarctica to achieve these goals. This paper presents detailed values on food production (edible biomass) and inedible biomass production of the vegetable crops cultivated in the experimental phase in 2018.FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabThe EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility in Antarctica around 400 m south of the German Neumayer Station III.The difference of the EDEN ISS MTF to the other facilities is its unique location. The MTF is positioned in the vicinity of the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica. This continent offers several conditions which are favorable for space analog test campaigns (Bubenheim et al., 1994). While most of the other facilities were built to conduct research on humans living in a closed loop life support system, EDEN ISS focuses on cultivating plants in controlled conditions, testing the necessary hardware and investigating microbiology, food quality and safety aspects. Furthermore, most of the facilities mentioned earlier were built and operated in the 1980s–2000s and are no longer available, except for Lunar Palace 1 which was built only a few years ago and is still in operation. EDEN ISS also uses technologies which were not available in the past (e.g., LED lighting for plant cultivation).The novel aspect of the EDEN ISS project is its approach to work with a compromise climate in which all crops are grown simultaneously. This is more realistic for near-term space greenhouses as compared to studies were each crop has its own optimized climate. Despite not having the optimal climate for each crop the food production of the MTF in the 2018 season was higher than expected. In 2018, for the first time a comprehensive set of measurements were performed in an analog space greenhouse. These measurements encompass the biomass production data presented in this paper, but also data on the microbial environment inside the greenhouse, the quality and safety of the produced food, the resources (e.g., carbon dioxide, nutrients, consumables) necessary to grow the crops, the amount of electrical energy and crewtime required and the acceptance of the food to the station crew. The biomass production dataset presented in this paper can be used to improve simulation models for space greenhouses. It can also be used for cultivar selection, because the dataset includes values on different cultivars (e.g., for lettuce and tomato) which is helpful to assess which cultivar should be grown in the next space greenhouse. The data is also a valuable contribution to the recently developed Crop Readiness Level evaluation method (Romeyn et al., 2019) for crop candidates for space greenhouses."

        "Title": "Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both\nsku5\nand\nspr1\nmutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The\nspr1\nmutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas\nsku5\nshowed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in\nsku5\nplants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by\nSKU5\nand\nSPR1\nhave unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The\nspr1\nresponse is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the\nsku5\nresponses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, root, skewing, transcriptomics, abiotic stress, acclimation, physiological adaptation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight studies offer unique insights into plant biological processes, and enable the exploration of the relationships between root morphology, gene expression and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The developmental patterns of plant organs are continuously altered through perception of the environment, signal integration, and response to environmental stimuli. A diversity of tropic gradients influence the path of growth in roots by initiating localized, asymmetrical changes in cell elongation. These changes are primarily brought about through hormonal interactions and subsequent remodeling of cell physiology (Roy and Bassham, 2014;Vandenbrink et al., 2014;Schultz et al., 2017). Root skewing and waving are phenomena in which root growth deviates from a gravity vector throughout its development, and which vary between theArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) ecotypes Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS) (Rutherford and Masson, 1996;Roy and Bassham, 2014;Schultz et al., 2017). Although once thought to be a gravity-dependent growth behavior (Oliva and Dunand, 2007), skewing occurs in the microgravity of spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012a). This suggests that skewing is independent of both the tropic force of gravity and the gravity-induced contact forces between roots and growth media (Millar et al., 2011;Paul et al., 2012a,2013;Nakashima et al., 2014). Therefore, the spaceflight environment provides a unique and relevant context in which to study genes associated with skewing phenotypes.Plants grown in the spaceflight environment exhibit complex and unique gene expression patterns (e.g.,Paul et al., 2005;Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). The predominant feature of the spaceflight environment is microgravity. The lack of gravity has a direct effect on plant cells and signal transduction; this direct effect represents a novel environment for plants, and any terrestrial organism, and appears to be generally perceived as stressful. In addition, microgravity imposes secondary environmental stresses due to the disruption of fluid movement, and any processes influenced by convection, such as gas exchange and temperature redistribution. Combinatorial stresses induce changes in gene expression and tolerance that are not fully recapitulated by exposure to the individual stressors (e.g.,Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015;Suzuki et al., 2016). Thus it is important to think of the spaceflight environment as more complex than microgravity alone. Several classes of stress response genes have been identified as consistently involved in the response to spaceflight across ecotypes of Arabidopsis via analyses of gene expression. Heat shock genes are often induced by spaceflight (Paul et al., 2005,2012b;Salmi and Roux, 2008;Shagimardanova et al., 2010;Zupanska et al., 2013,2017,2019;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and scavenging processes are also common in the spaceflight response, though ROS-associated genes have been observed as both up- and downregulated in spaceflight (Shagimardanova et al., 2010;Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013,2017;Kwon et al., 2015;Choi et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2019). Some stress gene expression changes are also associated with spaceflight-induced changes in the Arabidopsis methylome (Zhou et al., 2019). Cell wall remodeling processes are enriched in spaceflight gene expression datasets (Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017). Cell wall remodeling genes, typically associated with biotic stress and pathogen defense pathways, also contribute to spaceflight acclimation (Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Choi et al., 2019). Spaceflight also affects abundances of proteins of defense pathways and cell wall remodeling (Mazars et al., 2014;Ferl et al., 2015). However, the particular genetic pathways activated and repressed in spaceflight vary among ecotypes of Arabidopsis, demonstrating that there are significant genotypic contributions to spaceflight physiological adaptation (Paul et al., 2017;Beisel et al., 2019;Choi et al., 2019).Mutations in genes associated with stress response and signaling pathways can significantly alter the differential gene expression profiles of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Single gene mutations in heat shock transcription factors, gravity perception genes, and light signaling genes in Arabidopsis seedlings and cultures exhibit altered spaceflight responses (Paul et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017,2019). Therefore, we sought to understand better the relationships among spaceflight responses, root morphology, and spaceflight adaptation by exploring the spaceflight responses of two single gene skewing-related mutant lines:spiral1andsku5.Spiral1(Spr1) is a skewing-related gene that contributes to the process of anisotropic cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. Thespr1mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in the roots as skewing to the left when viewed, according to convention, from beneath their growth medium (Rutherford and Masson, 1996;Furutani et al., 2000;Nakajima et al., 2004;Sedbrook et al., 2004;Galva et al., 2014). The SPR1 protein is a microtubule plus-end tracking protein that localizes to the plus ends of actively polymerizing cortical microtubules, dissociating upon a shift to microtubule depolymerization (Sedbrook et al., 2004;Galva et al., 2014). This association is mediated by two similar motifs on the N- and C-termini of the protein, which allow SPR1 to act as an intermolecular linker (Nakajima et al., 2004;Sedbrook et al., 2004;Galva et al., 2014). The protein END-BINDING 1B (EB1b) co-localizes with SPR1 at the microtubule plus-end, where each protein interacts with the other as well as tubulin subunits (Galva et al., 2014). This creates the dual effects of SPR1 and EB1b increasing microtubule stability and polymerization rate, while also enhancing the rescue rate of depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). However, thespr1mutation also leads to a decreased rate of shrinkage among depolymerizing microtubules (Galva et al., 2014). The regulation of microtubule dynamics is critical to many environmental responses, such as in salt stress where 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 is known to occur in conjunction with microtubule reorganization to enable stress acclimation (Shoji et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2016). In addition to these micro-scale changes, the skewing phenotype ofspr1is significantly enhanced by cold treatment, and suppressed by both salt and heat stresses (Furutani et al., 2000;Sedbrook et al., 2004). This connectsSPR1to processes regulating morphology in both optimal and stressful environments.Sku5is a skewing-associated gene that encodes a protein in the SKU5-SIMILAR (SKS) family, which is related to known Arabidopsis copper oxidases, but which contains only one Type-II copper-coordinating domain of unknown specificity (Sedbrook et al., 2002). Thesku5mutant was originally noted for the rightward skewing it exhibits on vertically oriented growth media, which manifests in both WS and Col-0 backgrounds (Sedbrook et al., 2002;Swarbreck et al., 2019).Sku5seedlings exhibit reductions of root length but not of cell size, and SKU5 is hypothesized to act in the process of cell division as a result (Sedbrook et al., 2002). SKU5 localizes to the plasma membrane, but is also present in soluble and cell wall-binding forms in the extracellular milieu (Sedbrook et al., 2002;Borderies et al., 2003;Baral et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2018). SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP), and as such is a component of discrete plasma membrane nanodomains known as “lipid rafts” (Borner et al., 2005;Elortza et al., 2006;Chen et al., 2018;Mamode Cassim et al., 2019). These nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play roles in stress response signaling at the interface between the cell wall and membrane, where they are envisioned to help shape the “signatures” that activate downstream plant adaptive responses to the stresses they experience (Minami et al., 2008;Takahashi et al., 2013,2016,2019;Shabala et al., 2015;Yeats et al., 2018;Miki et al., 2019). The endocytosis of SKU5 and other GPI-APs is modulated across the root tip by salt and auxin treatments, linking the movement of these proteins to stress responses (Baral et al., 2015). The expression of SKU5 is itself regulated by boron deprivation, cold, salt, and immune responses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) treatment (Keinath et al., 2010;Elmore et al., 2012;Li et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2016;Shi et al., 2018;Miki et al., 2019). While SKU5 interactors are unknown in Arabidopsis, a maize homolog of SKU5 interacts with a C-terminal peptide of AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1)in vitro(Shimomura, 2006). ABP1 is associated with auxin signaling pathways that activate the plant TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) regulatory complex, remodel the cortical microtubule network, and induce expansive growth by triggering cation influx (Xu et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2016;Dahlke et al., 2017;Schepetilnikov et al., 2017). This further connects SKU5 to characterized pathways which affect stress responses and regulate the balance between growth and autophagic processes under stressful conditions, such as that of spaceflight.SKU5 and SPR1 are therefore very different proteins in seemingly unrelated physiological processes, but both proteins have roles in root skewing. Both of these proteins are also associated with cell wall remodeling, a process that is regularly involved in spaceflight acclimation. As such, these genes offer an appropriate initial genetic dissection of root skewing and the effect of skewing pathways in the microgravity of spaceflight environments. Extensive discussion of the relevance of skewing and waving in microgravity has been presented elsewhere (e.g.,Paul et al., 2012a), but to paraphrase from that paper, prior to spaceflight research, the consensus was that gravitropism was the directional driver in skewing (e.g.,Simmons et al., 1995;Oliva and Dunand, 2007). Yet we now know that gravity is not required, and root skewing in spaceflight appears to be an inherent feature of many Arabidopsis ecotypes, even in conditions lacking both light and gravity (Millar et al., 2011;Paul et al., 2012a,2017;Nakashima et al., 2014). These observations suggest a testable relationship among root morphologies governed by skewing regulation pathways. The hypothesis is that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via the inherent cell wall remodeling that accompanies those morphologies and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. This relationship was examined by growingspr1,sku5and their wild type controls for 4 and 8 days on the International Space Station and at the Kennedy Space Center, then observing both their growth morphologies and gene expression profiles in response to spaceflight as measures of response quality and complexity. A change in gene expression or morphology during spaceflight would suggest a significant role for these skewing genes in the physiological adaptation process.Differential gene expression profiles are often deployed as measures of the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation and developmental changes within an organism. Differential gene expression responses, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment (e.g.:Chan et al., 2016). Therefore gene expression profiles morphologies were used to examine the relationships between skewing genes and the resulting complexity of spaceflight acclimation. SKU5 and SPR1 function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, which enabled a test of the relevance of contrasting skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. Growth morphologies were used to examine the productivity and developmental success of these genotypes in spaceflight."

        "Title": "Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe major load-bearing tissue within the joint is articular cartilage (AC). AC is exquisitely sensitive to changes in biomechanical loading (reviewed by Sanchez-Adams et al.1). Under normal conditions, chondrocytes synthesize a balance of extracellular matrix (ECM) components so that the ability to resist tensile and compressive forces is maintained. Deviation from the normal range of biomechanical forces,2–5including complete unloading,6–8tips the balance from maintenance to pathology typically leading to cartilage erosion and later osteoarthritis. While the effects of the biomechanical unloading environment of spaceflight on bone and skeletal muscle are well-studied,9,10the effects on AC are largely unknown. The responses of AC to microgravity are important to define because it is clear from clinical studies that load-bearing AC is different from bone and skeletal tissue in that has a very poor capacity to restore damaged tissue.11Consequently, microgravity-induced joint pathology could compromise flight crew mobility, interfere with mission activities, and accelerate short- and long-term joint degradation in flight personnel.To investigate the effect of extended microgravity on AC, joint tissue from mice exposed to 30 days of Spaceflight in the BION-M1 flight was assessed for evidence of cartilage degradation. Our data suggest that spaceflight results in tissue degradation in load-bearing AC, but not in minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.\nKeywords:\nhost-microbe interactions, microgravity, microbiome, space flight",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight impacts all living organisms from their genome to physiome. Whether it is the reduction in gravity, increased exposure to low dose radiation, chronic elevated CO2levels or time dislocation, the physical factors associated with the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of stresses on biological systems. Of these physical factors, the reduction in gravity, or microgravity, is one of the most widely studied [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Gravity represents one of the most constant evolutionary drivers of life on Earth [8,9], and understanding how organisms respond to the absence of this ever-present force not only provides information on how gravity has shaped life on Earth, but also provides key insight into potential mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of microgravity during spaceflight. The large-scale physiological effects of microgravity-induced stress on animals and plants are relatively well known. For example, in humans, microgravity conditions result in bone loss, upwards to 3% per month [4,10,11], permutations to both the adaptive and innate immune systems [12], and an increased potential risk of bacterial and viral infections [13,14]. Plants also have an increased susceptibility to pathogenic colonization in microgravity [15], as well as altered rates of cell division, changes in morphological structures of cell tissues, such as root hairs, and induced chromosomal aberrations [16,17,18]. Although these overarching phenotypes associated with microgravity exposure have been observed for decades, ascertaining whether the phenotypes are specific to microgravity or other environmental variables, as well as the underlying etiology of these effects at the cellular and biomolecular level are not yet fully delineated.Compounding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these physiological effects is the relatively unknown impact of microgravity on the microbiome associated with eukaryotic organisms. A microbiome is typically defined as the sum of the microbes, genomes and community interactions that occur in a particular environment. The term was first applied to humans to understand the ecology of those microbes that interact with the body [19] but has been quickly adopted to represent a holistic approach to understanding the connectivity and interactions within any complex host-microbe association [20]. In humans, the recent human microbiome sequencing project has revealed that the collective metagenome of those microbes that associate with humans dwarfs the size of the human genome and contains a consortia of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, the specific contributions of which are not yet fully delineated (Figure 1) [21]. Initial surveys indicate that for every one human gene there are approximately 360 bacterial genes, thereby providing humans with millions of genes of additional metabolisms and cellular activities [22,23].Figure 1.Open in a new tabOverview of the complexity of human microbiome. Circle size reflects the approximate relative abundance of the various microbes known to associate with humans. Relative gene abundance is derived from the human microbiome sequencing project [19,22]. Question marks reflect uncertainty or potential underestimation of gene abundance.Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the importance the microbiome plays in maintaining plant and animal health [22,24]. Aspects previously attributed to the host are now recognized as being the result of interactions with microbes [22,25,26]. For example, analyses of germ-free and normally colonized mice have shown that the gut microbiota is responsible for most of the metabolites found in mammalian blood [27]. Additionally, some species of bacteria within human gut have been recently correlated to the onset of several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes [28,29,30,31]; colorectal cancers [32]; and obesity [33] suggesting that perturbations to the gut environment (e.g., antibiotic treatments) can increase the potential risk of disease. However, in many of these same cases, modulations of the gut microbiota and probiotic therapies have been shown to attenuate the condition and treat the host organism [24].Together, these studies indicate that stable diverse microbial communities and functional gene redundancies can provide resiliency to the host’s microbiota to withstand temporary community disturbances and potentially resist invasion by exogenous pathogenic microbes [24,34]. However, continuous or regular perturbations to the environment, such as exposure to microgravity, may result in loss of biodiversity or extirpation (i.e., the extinction of a species in localized areas of the microbiome), potentially driving the community towards disease.Although the short- and long-term resilience (i.e., susceptibility of community to disturbances or extirpation) of animal and plant microbiomes in response to microgravity is virtually unknown, microbial exchange and transfers do occur between microbiomes during spaceflight [35,36] and there is increasing evidence that microgravity induces physiological and developmental changes within specific host-microbe interactions as discussed below. Assessing the impact of microgravity on a host organism and its microbiota requires a comprehensive analysis that includes the study of both pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria as cultures andin situto fully understand the requirements needed to maintain host health in the space flight environment."

        "Abstract": null,
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPerhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, seeFraune and Bosch, 2010;Hooper, 2015). At these interfaces, the partners influence one another’s form and function. For example, enteropathogenicEscherichia coli(EPEC) efface the brush border and hijack the cytoskeletal proteins of the epithelia to create features that promote pathogenesis (Celliet al., 2000). The microbiota of both invertebrates and vertebrates can induce an increase in the density of microvilli (Cerezuelaet al., 2012;Chichlowskiet al., 2007;Kuhlweinet al., 2013;Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998;Ringøet al., 2007;Shuklaet al., 2012) and, reciprocally, microvillus-derived vesicles of the brush border help to communicate with and control bacterial populations (Shifrinet al., 2012). In addition, it has long been known that epithelial tissues associated with microbes, such as the gut, are on profound daily rhythms. Only recently, however, has it been demonstrated that the microbial partners play a role in the control of these rhythms (Heath-Heckmanet al., 2013;Leoneet al., 2015;Rosselotet al., 2016;Wieret al., 2010), but the extent to which daily rhythms affect the microarchitecture of the brush border has not been characterized.TheEuprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischerisymbiosis offers an opportunity to explore how and when symbiont-induced changes of the brush border are induced in early development and how they interface with the daily rhythms of the symbiosis. Early studies of the association demonstrated that colonization of the host animal induces ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells of crypts where symbionts take up residence. The epithelium of the newly hatched juvenile host begins as a simple, columnar epithelial layer with sparse microvilli (Fig. S1A). Upon symbiont colonization, these epithelial cells increase in volume fourfold to take on a cuboidal morphology (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994;Visicket al., 2000). In addition, the density and complexity of microvilli increases such that symbiont cells, while remaining extracellular, become surrounded by host membranes (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998;Fig. S1A). These observed changes were derived from data taken at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following colonization, i.e., at times that would not capture daily rhythms.Concomitant with these studies of the juvenile, it was discovered that the symbiosis in adults has a daily rhythm; animals expel ~95% of their symbionts into the surrounding seawater each day around dawn (Graf and Ruby, 1998;Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). A recent study of the adult transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrated that host cytoskeletal genes are highly regulated in the hours around dawn (Wieret al., 2010). These changes in gene expression correlate with a blebbing off of the microvilli of the crypt epithelial brush border, not unlike that observed in EPEC pathogenesis; this effacement is followed by a re-formation of the microvillous brush border (Fig. S1B). A subsequent study of the system revealed that the symbionts control transcriptional regulation of clock genes of a peripheral circadian rhythm specific to the light organ (Heath-Heckmanet al., 2013). Taken together, these data showed that the squid-vibrio symbiosis displays a profound daily rhythm.Whether the daily changes in the adult brush border occur in juveniles, and how such changes interface with symbiont-induced development of the juvenile crypt epithelia, have not been characterized. In addition, while it is known that increase in crypt cell volume requires symbiont light production (Visicket al., 2000), the feature(s) of the symbiont that trigger(s) brush-border remodelling has remained unknown. This study was undertaken to address these questions. The data show that the remodelling of the crypt brush borders begins in juvenile animals and this activity requires influences from both an environmental light cue and interaction with the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of symbiont cells."

        "Title": "Modeled microgravity alters lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane vesicle production of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nReduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium\nVibrio fischeri\nwas examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from\nV. fischeri\nis known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of\nV. fischeri\ndefective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of\nV. fischeri\n, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.\nSubject terms:\nMicrobiology, Zoology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAll animals form beneficial associations with microbes, and these symbioses, collectively called the microbiome, constitute a powerful determinant of development, health, and fitness1,2. Indeed, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, its secretion of bioactive metabolites, as well as the symbionts’ resultant with host systems (e.g., nervous, immune, endocrine) have been found to correlate with a variety of illnesses and disorders2–4. Understanding how mutualistic microbes adapt to stressful conditions within animal hosts, including humans, therefore, represents a crucial topic for microbiome research.One environment that presents numerous challenges to host–microbe homeostasis is spaceflight5. In particular, the microgravity conditions (10−6× g) that astronauts experience during spaceflight have been shown to disrupt the normal physiology of the human body, including the intestinal microbiome6,7. This dysbiotic response is characterized by a decline in gut bacteria predicted to be protective, includingBifidobacteriumandLactobacillusspp.; the increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens likeEscherichia coli, Enterobacteriaspp., andClostridiaspp.; as well as shifts in the relative proportions of dominant taxa from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes6–12.In addition to measuring the relative abundance of various bacterial populations, many studies have also sought to determine the impact of the spaceflight on the physiology of those taxa. In this regard, microgravity and microgravity-analog conditions have been found to increase the resistance of opportunistic pathogens, such asE. coliandPseudomonas aeruginosa, to acid, heat, osmotic, and oxidative stresses13–15. Cultivation in these conditions is also known to promote biofilm formation and enhance the virulence of certain pathogens, includingSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium16–19andSerratia marcescens20. Though much progress has been made in delineating how pathogenic microbes respond to this unique stressor, the larger discussion of how beneficial microbes respond to microgravity has only recently begun to be examined21–27.One mutualistic association that has emerged as a tractable model by which to examine beneficial host–microbe interactions under modeled and natural microgravity conditions is the monospecific symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid,Euprymna scolopes, and its bioluminescent partnerVibrio fischeri21,24,28. Upon hatching,V. fischericolonizes a specialized organ, known as the light organ, within the host animal and induces an irreversible remodeling of the symbiotic tissues29. The remodeling is marked by a pronounced apoptotic cell death event throughout the light organ’s superficial, ciliated epithelium30,31, a structure that is used to recruit symbiosis-competentV. fischerifrom the environment and facilitate the onset of the association.Two microbe-associated molecular pattern signals (MAMPs) that have been identified as the primary mediators of theV. fischeri-induced apoptotic event inE. scolopesare LPS and the peptidoglycan-derived monomer, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT)32,33. These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset of symbiosis33,34. Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues, however, is primarily attributed to LPS32, and most of the LPS released byV. fischeriis embedded in outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed, polar, flagella (Fig.1a–c)35,36. The rapid onset of MAMP-inducible phenotypes, combined with the binary nature of the light organ symbiosis, has rendered the squid-vibrio system a uniquely informative model for the study of animal-microbial mutualisms in microgravity22.Fig. 1.

HARVs mimic the quiescent, low-shear, fluid conditions of spaceflight when rotated around a horizontal axis (Fig.1d)22,37. Alternatively, rotation around a vertical axis is used to control for system-specific effects under normal Earth gravity conditions22,38. This low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment has been used to successfully mimic microgravity for decades, and has been correlated to results obtained during actual spaceflight13,23,37.Previous work with the squid-vibrio symbiosis using LSMMG has found that the normal symbiont-induced development of the light organ is altered by LSMMG21,23,24,27. Specifically, modeled microgravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings21. Given the role of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development ofE. scolopes, these findings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a crucial component of both beneficial and pathogenic interactions39; therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the release of LPS and OMVs byV. fischeri, and assessed the overall physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on beneficial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interactions during spaceflight."

        "Title": "Emergence of novel cephalopod gene regulation and expression through large-scale genome reorganization",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nColeoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid\nEuprymna scolopes\n, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.\nSubject terms:\nEvolutionary developmental biology, Evolutionary genetics, Molecular evolution",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionCephalopods have the largest invertebrate nervous systems and possess many lineage-specific adaptations such as rapid adaptive camouflage, arms with suckers and camera-type eyes. Many cephalopod characteristics evolved convergently to those of vertebrates, which makes them an attractive system to study the genetic basis of wide-scale organismal innovations and the pathways behind their evolution.On a genomic level, the emergence of novel genes, extensive gene duplications, and wide-ranging RNA editing have been described in cephalopod genomes1. Expansions of gene families such as C2H2s, Protocadherins, and GPCRs, and extensive RNA editing allowed the diversification of protein-coding transcripts in the nervous system and is proposed to have played an important role in its evolution. While similar innovations are known from vertebrate genomes, the mechanisms driving the evolution of these features are different: vertebrates went through several rounds of whole-genome duplications that produced large sets of multi-copy genes and the diversification of their functions, there is no indication for similar events in cephalopods1–3. In contrast, it has been suggested that the coleoid cephalopod (squids, cuttlefish, octopus) lineage went through large-scale genome reorganization2,3.A property of metazoan genomes is that local gene order or microsynteny is conserved between even distantly related species4–6. This conservation is supported by functional studies of regulatory constraints, shown in genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs)4,5,7, as well as co-expression of neighboring genes in tissues or cell types8. Early genome assemblies in several coleoids indicate that local gene order has been greatly disrupted, breaking ancient microsyntenies and bringing previously unlinked genes together2,3. This event, potentially at a whole-genome scale, could have affected hundreds of gene families, disrupting the order of genes in comparison to the last common ancestor of coleoid cephalopods and other molluscs. The extent of this event is difficult to estimate due to the lack of chromosomal-scale assemblies in cephalopods. To begin to understand the extent of the genome reorganization and its impact on cephalopod genome biology and evolution, we study the emerging model speciesEuprymna scolopes(Hawaiian bobtail squid). This species has been at the center of symbiosis research for over 30 years9,10, but is also an attractive model system for evolution and development research due to its small adult size, large egg clutches, and relative ease of culture.To reconstruct the regulatory landscape in theE. scolopesgenome, we applied chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C) and open chromatin profiling techniques (ATAC-seq) as well as collected additional expression data. Hi-C allowed us to both improve the previously publishedE. scolopesgenome assembly as well as to capture the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Using comparative genomic approaches, we describe the global nature of the genome reshuffling in coleoid cephalopods and demonstrate the emergence of many microsyntenic regions that were previously unlinked in other species. Our data also reveals interactions between distant genomic loci (the topological organization of the genome) shedding light on the three-dimensional organization of theE. scolopesgenome, as well as identifying genes located in regulatory loops and topologically associating domains (TADs). Our open chromatin data reveals regions accessible to transcription factors and thus potentially constituting regulatory elements. Together, these data allow us to gain insights into the impact of evolutionary changes in gene linkages and the emergence of novel gene regulation. This study provides the basis for the understanding of the evolution of cephalopod genomes and possible implications on morphological novelties in this clade."

One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid,\nEuprymna scolopes,\nand the gram-negative bacterium,\nVibrio fischeri,\nwas studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.\nResults\nAnalysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.\nConclusions\nThe outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases.

We hypothesized that\nin vitro\nculture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions.

In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionArticular cartilage possessesa complex, zonal architecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone. Since bone-to-bone interfaces are known to integrate better and faster than cartilage-to-bone interfaces, tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs are a promising technique for articular cartilage repair.1,2Indeed, various composite grafts have been explored for osteochondral tissue regeneration utilizing a variety of cell-seeded scaffolds, including hyaluronan sponges with calcium phosphate supports,3nonwoven poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) meshes with collagen-hydroxyapatite supports,4three-dimensional (3D) printed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(lactide) scaffolds with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/tricalcium phosphate supports,5agarose gels with devitalized trabecular bones,6and collagen gels with hydroxyapatite supports.7Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising cell source for osteochondral tissue engineering, due to their multilineage differentiation potential.8,9Moreover, dynamic interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (i.e., chemical, mechanical, and temporal) factors determine the developmental fate of hMSCs10,11and tissue-engineered constructs.12,13Appropriate control of these factors may lead to favorable outcomes in osteochondral tissue engineering. The present work describes cartilage and bone tissue engineering using hMSCs and a 3D woven scaffold that we recently developed.14Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as the scaffold material because it degrades relatively slowly15and possesses an appropriately high bulk stiffness to facilitate MSC differentiation toward skeletal lineages.16In our recentin vitrostudy17chondrogenesis and mechanical functionality were clearly evident for 21-day constructs made from hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and cultured statically on 3D woven PCL scaffolds, with average aggregate and Young's moduli (HAof 0.37 MPa andEof 0.41 MPa, respectively) approaching values reported for normal articular cartilage (HAof 0.1–2.0 MPa;Eof 0.4–0.8 MPa).18–20In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression in engineered skeletal tissues generated using hMSCs and 3D woven PCL scaffolds. On the basis of our recent finding that static culture supported chondrogenesis in thisin vitromodel,17all constructs in the present study were cultured statically. We selected to seed the PCL scaffolds with hMSC mixed in a type I collagen gel such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency and helped to maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis.21In one group of constructs, the medium was supplemented with soluble molecular mediators associated with chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs (i.e., transforming growth factor [TGF]-β, insulin, and dexamethasone),22whereas in the other group the medium contained additives associated with osteogenic differentiation (i.e., serum, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone).23Properties of the resulting engineered tissues were assessed at multiple levels at culture days 1, 21, and 45."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions.Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9.Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10and mesenchymal stem11cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown ofsbp-1andmdt-15reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids.The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza andPseudomonas aeruginosahave been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37.Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the generaStaphylococcusandTyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p<0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the generaClostridium,Romboutsia,Ruminiclostridium, andShuttleworthia, and decreases inHungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment ofDoreasp. and the speciesLactobacillus murinus.In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig.1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight.Fig. 1.

        "Title": "Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhile studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium,\nSerratia marcescens,\nin simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the\nDrosophila melanogaster\nhost when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated\nS. marcescens\n. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in\nS. marcescens\nand that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated\nS. marcescens\nand provides a potential mitigation strategy.\nKeywords:\nLow shear modeled microgravity,\nDrosophila melanogaster\n,\nSerratia marcescens\n, Asparagine, Virulence",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHuman pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns [1]. One such environmental condition is spaceflight, which has been demonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during spaceflight [2,3]. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of significant phenotypic shifts during spaceflight, including increased antibiotic resistance [4,5,6,7], increased virulence [8,9,10,11], and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity [12]. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Specifically, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how these mechanistic changes might be influencing the host immune response during infection.Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bacteria,Serratia marcescens,has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance [13,14].S. marcescensis a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains [14,15,16]. Furthermore,S. marcescenswas found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station [17,18]. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the complications with antibiotic resistance [2,18].Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a significant shift in virulence withS. marcescens(Db11) after spaceflight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station,S. marcescensDb11 killed healthy ground-rearedDrosophila melanogasterhosts significantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground [11]. However, the specific mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reducedD. melanogastersurvival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies withSalmonella[19], andStaphylococcus aureus[20], which pose a threat to astronaut health during spaceflight. Our prior research has shown thatSerratia marcescensalso shows a significant increase in host lethality ofD. melanogasterafter growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions [11].Since spaceflight studies are costly and can be difficult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of spaceflight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity [21,22,23]. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low fluid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the spaceflight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate findings from spaceflight studies [10,11].Drosophila melanogaster, as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for spaceflight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies [11,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35].In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the specific mechanisms that enable microgravity-treatedSerratia marcescensbacteria to kill the hostD. melanogastermore quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to knownS. marcescensvirulence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMG compared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B (asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria [36,37]. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence [38]. Amino acids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection [38]. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-rearedS. marcescenskilled the host faster after infection [11] than controlS. marcescenscultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment.Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes inS. marcescenswith a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we find that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-specific manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more specifically, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such asS. marcescens, asan essential consideration to maintain host health during spaceflight."

        "Title": "Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA single strain from the family\nPaenibacillaceae\nwas isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus\nCohnella\n, designated as F6_2S_P_1\nT\n. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1\nT\nstrain places it in a clade with\nC. rhizosphaerae\nand\nC. ginsengisoli\n, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al.,2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019; Urbaniak et al.,2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al.,2004; Checinska et al.,2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al.,2016; Venkateswaran et al.,2017; Urbaniak et al.,2018; Bijlani et al.,2020; Daudu et al.,2020; Solomon et al.,2020; Blachowicz et al.,2021; Simpson et al.,2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al.,2018; Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019; Urbaniak et al.,2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the generaBacillusandPaenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genusCohnellahas been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al.,2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1Twas isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1Tin the genusCohnella.The genusCohnella(familyPaenibacillaceae, orderBacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genusPaenibacillus, with the description ofCohnella thermotolerans(type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification ofPaenibacillus hongkongensisasCohnella hongkongensis(Teng et al.,2003).Cohnellaspecies are differentiated fromPaenibacillusdue to high iso-C16:0content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al.,2006). Members ofCohnellaare rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive.Cohnellaspecies have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al.,2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Flores-Felix et al.,2014) and compost heaps (He et al.,2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al.,2020; Hero et al.,2021; Chen et al.,2022; Mohammadi et al.,2022). As with the genusPaenibacillus, many members of the genusCohnellaare strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al.,2018). Multiple novelCohnellaspecies have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Wang et al.,2012,2015; Flores-Felix et al.,2014; Takada et al.,2019).Cohnellaspecies are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al.,2010; Hameed et al.,2013; Hero et al.,2021; Johnson et al.,2021). Overall, whileCohnellaspecies have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al.,2003; Abou Abdallah et al.,2019; Kim et al.,2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals.In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1Tand describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establishCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tas a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1Tshowed that it was most closely related to fourCohnellaspecies without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al.,2010; Kampfer et al.,2014). Thus, the strainsCohnella ginsengisoliDSM 18997TandCohnella rhizosphaeraeDSM 28161Twere acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species.The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1Twithin the genusCohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genusCohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1Tis part of a branch of the genusCohnellawhich is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1Tis a member were characterized."

Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (\nKalamiella piersonii\n) and one novel bacterial species (\nMethylobacterium ajmalii\n). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space.

Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the\nEnterobacter bugandensis\nMAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSince the publication of the first metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) in 2004 [1], MAGs have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host-microbe relationships [2]. When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms likeCandidatus Amarolinea aalborgensisgen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera likeSpiribacter[6] andKalamiella[7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12].Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13].Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species,Kalamiella piersonii[7]. We have retrieved fourK. piersoniiMAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related generaPantoeafromKalamiellaand facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n= 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species,Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14].The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures.

This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.\nKeywords:\nindoor microbiome, biocontrol, probiotic cleaning, bacillus, antibiotic resistance, built environment, AMR, metabolic modelling",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionCleaning and disinfection practices in homes and hospitals to combat bacteria, fungi, and viruses have a long history. Ancient civilizations used various disinfection methods to remove “pestilence,” from the rudimentary practices of boiling and sunlight exposure to the use of natural substances like vinegar and sulphur [1]. However, it was not until the 19th century that the age of modern infection control began to take shape with targeted cleaning practices. For example, Ignaz Semmelweis introduced hand disinfection in hospitals [2], and Florence Nightingale introduced best practices to decrease infection rates and improve patient healing [3]. In the following decades, the use of carbolic acid by Joseph Lister for surgical instrument sterilization, in conjunction with other antiseptic methods, further enhanced pathogen control in clinical settings [4]. By the early-to-mid 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics and the development of chemical disinfectants, such as phenol and bleach, provided a newfound defence against infectious agents [5]. Though antibiotics have been highly successful and saved many lives, the overuse of these drugs has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus, making traditional antibiotics less effective [6]. Additionally, pathogens are evolving resistance to biocidal compounds used in traditional cleaning solutions [7]. However, chemical treatments such as phenol and bleach remain effective despite providing only temporary removal of pathogens on surfaces.To reduce the risks associated with various disinfection cleaning agents, hospitals now more frequently use a variety of cleaning strategies for disinfection, including advanced technologies like exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide vapour [8]. Despite these powerful treatments, outbreaks ofClostridioides difficile[9] and other antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms [10-14] have continued to rise within healthcare settings, highlighting the enduring challenge of simultaneously disinfecting an area while avoiding selection for traits that increase pathogenic potential. Reducing the spread of AMR pathogens is a crucial priority for global human health. In 2019, 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by AMR pathogens globally [15], and they are projected to cause an additional 10 million deaths annually by 2050 [16]. We must therefore bolster our defences against persistent and emerging pathogens, safeguarding global health and well-being amidst the evolving landscape of microbial threats [17].The inability of current hospital disinfection methods to fully combat these challenges emphasizes the crucial need for continuous research, development, and adaptation of infection control methods. Although traditional cleaning methods have helped to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in the built environment, using microbes sourced from different environments to inhibit pathogen survival and transmission is an intriguing new tool that is posed to further improve the health of people indoors. Reintroducing specific microbes into buildings can potentially revolutionize how we prevent the emergence and persistence of unwanted microbes. However, deploying what could be called a microbial biocontrol product is hampered by a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of action for this ecological strategy to control disease. Despite this knowledge gap, cleaning products containing bacteria that demonstrate antimicrobial activity have been developed [18] and are already publicly available for purchase.Bacillusspores are often used because many species are generally recognized as safe, nonpathogenic, produce a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds [19], and remain viable over long periods of time [20]. Though it is unknown how effectively these spores germinate on dry, nutrient-depleted surfaces in built environments, it is important to determine why they are found to be associated with a reduction in the abundance of hospital-associated pathogens [21-24]. It is unclear whether there is an actual competitive exclusion or inhibition effect or if the spores occupy niches on surfaces, thereby denying this space to pathogens. Alternatively, the spores may mask any detectable signal of the pathogens, as determined via DNA sequencing methods. If the latter is true, this could mean that the pathogens remain viable and can cause infection. Answering this open question and moving the field towards improved public health objectives will require using a diverse suite of experimental and analytical approaches, including techniques that have been so far underutilized in built environment research.In the last decade, there have been critical innovations in the methods, study approaches, and experimental designs used to characterize diversity, survival, distribution, transmission, and health risk of microbes found in our buildings. A rapid explosion in observational studies over the last 15 years has provided a baseline analysis of the microbial diversity in built environments. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes has demonstrated that microbes colonize and spread throughout buildings in predictable ways [25-30]. In addition, shotgun metagenomic sequencing has been used to characterize the spread of AMR genes [31] and to quantify the relative abundance of microbial taxa across surfaces and on the skin of indoor environment occupants [32]. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been employed to determine the absolute abundance of specific AMR genes [33,34] or species of interest [35] in a diverse set of environments such as soil, water, air, faeces, and sediments. Further, targeted and untargeted metabolomics have been employed to characterize the distribution of chemicals around built spaces and infer the metabolic ecology of species interactions in experimental systems and real-world environments [36-38]. These methods can be enhanced using specialized DNA extraction techniques and internal standards to compensate for the low biomass typically recovered in built environment samples [32,39,40].Investigations in real-world built spaces have led to numerous new hypotheses regarding microbial survival and transmission, and the metabolic interactions that underpin these properties. Robustly testing these hypotheses has required innovations in experimental laboratory-based studies. Despite laboratories being built spaces themselves, recreating the inherent ecological dynamics that define the indoor microbiome has proven difficult and has required a reimagining of traditional microbiology techniques. Microbes in the built environment are generally assumed to be starving, dying, or dead [41]. We are, therefore, attempting to study life on the edge of survival. Many microorganisms are unable to survive on surfaces, but some pathogens have demonstrated the ability to survive on surfaces common to the built environment. For example, MRSA shows robust viability on surfaces such as vinyl and plastic over days [42]. Traditional microbiology cultivates microbes using media optimized over decades of experimentation to encourage their growth. Such conditions are unlikely to replicate microbial interactions in the built environment. So, it is necessary to use techniques that more closely reproduce the harsh conditions of most built environment surfaces to more accurately examine how microbes survive, grow, and interact in this environment.Observational studies and laboratory investigations inform intervention studies in ways that help determine the potential benefit of removing species of concern or introducing potentially beneficial microbes, both for the integrity of the building structure and the health of the occupants. Intervention studies have been performed in mock built environment microcosms, as well as in full-scale field trials, and are now elucidating the ecological dynamics of these environments. Unfortunately, due to the cost and added risk of conducting an intervention within buildings such as hospitals, only a few full-scale tests of these intervention techniques have been completed. This review will discuss recent advances in built environment microbiome research, with a focus on strategies related to the understanding and translation of biocontrol practices used to reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogens on surfaces in real-world clinical settings."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExtracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around\nArabidopsis thaliana\nroots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.\nKeywords:\nabscisic acid, ADP, ATP, calcium, channel, glutamate, root",

        "Title": "Salt stress-induced Ca2+ waves are associated with rapid, long-distance root-to-shoot signaling in plants.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTheir sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca\n2+\nwaves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the\nArabidopsis thaliana\nroot, Ca\n2+\nwave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca\n2+\nwave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between distant sites within the organism.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchiet al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (Massonet al., 2002). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes (Fukakiet al., 1998). This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots (Fukakiet al., 1998), (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism (Kisset al., 1997;Weise and Kiss, 1999;Fujihiraet al., 2000), (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants (Fitzelle and Kiss, 2001), and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation (Saitoet al., 2005;Hashiguchiet al., 2014). The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin (Rakusovaet al., 2011). The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003).The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response (Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Hashiguchiet al., 2013). Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles ofSHOOT GRAVITROPISM6(SGR6),VTI11/ZIGZAG-1(ZIG-1)/SGR4,SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22(SYP22)/SGR3andKATAMARI2(KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis (Fukakiet al., 1996b;Yamauchiet al., 1997;Katoet al., 2002;Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Saitoet al., 2005;Hashiguchiet al., 2014). A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case ofzig-1mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced (Yanoet al., 2003). Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion (Chen and Scheller, 2001;Wickner, 2010;Zhenget al., 2014b). Two mutant alleles ofVTI11,zig-1andimpaired traffic to tonoplast3(itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell (Zhenget al., 2014a,b). Treatment ofitt3andzig-1with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism (Zhenget al., 2014b). This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype ofzig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein (Tamuraet al., 2007), and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling (Hashiguchiet al., 2014). The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown.A tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane (Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Morita, 2010). Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time (Saitoet al., 2005;Moirtaet al., 2012). TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments (Gaoet al., 2005;Leitzet al., 2009;Moirtaet al., 2012). It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception (Morita, 2010;Blancaflor, 2013), but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs (Saitoet al., 2005). However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences (Saitoet al., 2005). Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly,kat2mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles (Tamuraet al., 2007), but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified.In addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Blancaflor, 2013). Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002;Yamamotoet al., 2002), reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells (Palmieri and Kiss, 2005) or have no effect in experiments with live cells (Saitoet al., 2005). An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of theshoot gravitropism9(sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin (Nakamuraet al., 2011).SGR9encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation (Nakamuraet al., 2011). The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts.Here we used live-cell imaging on a vertical stage microscope to demonstrate the role of the large central vacuole in shoot gravitropism in seedlings. Our results identified the upper hypocotyl endodermis as the gravisensing tissue and highlight a novel tight interaction between the vacuolar membrane and amyloplasts. The fragmented vacuoles in endodermal cells ofzig-1hypocotyls restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to the agravitropic phenotype of this mutant. We show that application of Wm tozig-1enhances their gravitropic response, restores amyloplast sedimentation and enhances the formation of TVSs. Additionally, we show that the tight association between vacuoles and amyloplasts observed inzig-1hypocotyls involves neither F-actin nor microtubules."

        "Title": "A ROS-assisted calcium wave dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1 propagates the systemic response to salt stress in Arabidopsis roots",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (\nROS\n) and cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\ntraveling throughout the plant. For the Ca\n2+\nwave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca\n2+\nwave originating from Ca\n2+\nrelease involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n). We conclude that a Ca\n2+\ndiffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds.

        "Title": "Real-time In Vivo Recording of Arabidopsis Calcium Signals During Insect Feeding Using a Fluorescent Biosensor",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nCalcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants.

This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionCalcium (Ca2+) is one of the most ubiquitous signaling elements in plants. A transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is decoded by a complex network of downstream components and is involved in the response to both abiotic and biotic stresses1,2. A rise in [Ca2+]cytis one of the first responses to microbial elicitors, forming a common part of the plant defense response3,4,5. Rises in [Ca2+]cythave also been observed in response to wounding caused by chewing insects, such as lepidopterans6,7. However, the potential role of plant Ca2+signals in response to live biotic threats that cause damage to only a few cells has not been explored. The green peach aphidMyzus persicaeis a hemipteran insect that represents a significant threat to world agriculture8,9, and Ca2+efflux from the extracellular space has been observed in leaves infested withM. persicae10.This protocol outlines a robust and repeatable method for measuring plant Ca2+signals whileM. persicaefeed from leaves using a fluorescent Ca2+biosensor, with both aphids and GCaMP3 offering novel tools with which to dissect the role of Ca2+during biotic interactions.Ca2+-selective microelectrodes were formerly used to measure [Ca2+] in plants11,12. More recently, bioluminescent and fluorescent approaches have become standardized. These biosensors bind Ca2+and emit light, allowing for un-paralleled opportunities to study Ca2+dynamics in both cells and whole tissues. Ca2+biosensors can be injected as dyes or stably produced upon the introduction of the biosensor coding sequence into the genome of the organism via transformation (i.e.,genetically encoded biosensors). The latter offers the major advantages of being easily expressed in live tissue and capable of subcellular localization13. The aequorin protein, isolated fromAequorea victoria(jellyfish) was the first genetically encoded Ca2+biosensor deployed in plants14. As a bioluminescent protein, aequorin does not require excitation by external light, which avoids chromophore bleaching and autofluorescence15. Aequorin has been successfully used to measure [Ca2+] fluxes in response to various stimuli, including temperature16, pathogens17,18,19, salt stress20,21, and wounding7. However, it is disadvantaged by the relatively low signal intensity, making the detection of [Ca2+] fluxes in individual cells and from tissues with poor sensor expression difficult13.The development of Ca2+biosensors that can fluoresce has complemented aequorin by allowing for detailed subcellular and tissue-level analysis of Ca2+dynamics. One of the most common fluorescent biosensors are the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cameleons. FRET Cameleons are composed of two proteins, typically CFP and YFP, which are brought into close contact by the conformational change induced by the binding of Ca2+to a calmodulin domain in the CFP-YFP linker region. This contact allows the transfer of energy from CFP to YFP, and the resulting change in the fluorescence of these fluorophores allows for the accurate quantification of [Ca2+] through the calculation of the ratio of the fluorescence signals from the two fluorophores22. FRET Cameleons are superior to aequorin and non-ratiometric florescent dyes, as they are less affected by the expression level of the protein23and often have a greater fluorescent yield, allowing for cellular and subcellular imaging23. For example, FRET Cameleons have been recently used to identify long-distance Ca2+signals in plants and to resolve these to the cellular level24,25,26.A recent breakthrough with fluorescent GFP-based Ca2+biosensors has been the development of highly sensitive single-fluorophore (single-FP) biosensors. Single-FP biosensors consist of a single circularly permutated GFP linked to a calmodulin and M13 peptide, with Ca2+binding to calmodulin, resulting in a water-mediated reaction between calmodulin and GFP so as to protonate GFP and increase fluorescent yield27,28,29. Single-FP sensors offer several advantages over FRET Cameleons, including simpler experimental design and a potentially higher temporal resolution of imaging30. Although single-FP sensors cannot quantify absolute [Ca2+] as simply as FRET sensors, they are superior for the analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of Ca2+signals5,23. GCaMPs are one of the best-established single-FP sensors28and have undergone several revisions to enhance their fluorescent yield, dynamic range, Ca2+affinity, and signal-to-noise ratios31,32,33,34. The GCaMPs have been successfully used in animal systems, such as zebrafish motor neurons35and fruit fly neuromuscular junctions34. Random mutagenesis of GCaMP3 has resulted in additional classes of single-FP sensors, including the ultrasensitive GCaMP636and the GECOs29. The GECOs were recently used inArabidopsis thaliana(henceforth referred to as Arabidopsis) to measure Ca2+fluxes in response to ATP, chitin, and the bacterial elicitor flg22. This study also demonstrated that the R-GECO biosensor outperformed the FRET Cameleon YC3.6 in terms of maximal signal change and signal-to-noise ratio5.Because of the ease of use, high fluorescent yield, and high temporal resolution that can be achieved with GCaMP biosensors, GCaMP3 was genetically encoded in Arabidopsis under theCauliflower mosaic virus35S promoter. The genetic tools available for Arabidopsis research allow for the detailed molecular analysis of the Ca2+signals measured by GCaMP3. In addition, the GCaMP3 biosensor can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope rather than a costlier confocal system. This protocol allows for whole-tissue imaging, essential when conducting experiments with live biotic stresses. The experiment is designed such that detached leaves from35S::GCaMP3plants are floated in water, to prevent insect escape and to restrict feeding to a specific tissue. The method outlined in this paper therefore allows for the analysis of leaf Ca2+dynamics during feeding byM. persicae, resulting in the characterization of a novel plant signaling response. This method can also be adapted to work with other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species and microbial pathogens, and with other plant tissues, such as roots."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAnimals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4.Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues5. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs)6–9, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt)10–15, and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants7,8,11,12,16–18.Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response6,7,11.

        "Title": "Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A discovery environment to explore multiple plant biology spaceflight experiments.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nRecent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast\n) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.\nKeywords:\nArabidopsis thaliana\n, spaceflight, transcriptomics, RNAseq, microarray, proteomics, bioinformatics, Qlik",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs a possible integral feature of life support systems, plants offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the mental health of the crew during long-duration missions in space. Therefore, at a practical level, plants are being intensively studied to assess their ability to adequately fulfill these roles in the spaceflight environment [reviewed in (Wheeler, 2017)]. In addition, a growing number of plant spaceflight studies are addressing the quest for fundamental knowledge about how plant biology operates. Thus, the spaceflight environment provides conditions that are inaccessible on Earth, such as growth in microgravity and exposure to cosmic radiation, providing a unique opportunity to dissect responses under conditions that plant biology has not encountered during its evolutionary history [reviewed in (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016;Paul et al., 2013a)].These studies are now generating extensive characterizations of the responses of diverse plant species to spaceflight. As part of the output from this research, there is an ever-increasing set of genome-scale analyses that range from transcriptomics [e.g., (Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Paul et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019;Herranz et al., 2019;Vandenbrink et al., 2019)] and proteomics [e.g., (Mazars et al., 2014;Ferl et al., 2015;Basu et al., 2017)] to epigenomics [e.g., (Zhou et al., 2019)]. These datasets help catalog the plant response to growing in space. For example, the omics database maintained by The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab program (GeneLab, 2019) contains, at the time of writing, data from over 200 spaceflight-related experiments, with about 20 plant-focused studies, mainly from research conducted using the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. In addition, similar spaceflight and related data from e.g., the Japanese, Chinese, and European space agencies have been deposited in a range of other publicly accessible data repositories such as NCBI GEO (Barrett et al., 2013) and the European CATdb (Gagnot et al., 2008). Each experiment has multiple spaceflight samples and often compares the responses of wild-type and mutants in spaceflight to parallel ground-based controls performed on the Earth. Research groups have then mined, e.g., the patterns of transcriptional change seen in individual experiments to reveal potential underlying plant responses to spaceflight. Thus, changes in the expression of heat shock proteins [e.g., (Zupanska et al., 2013;Johnson et al., 2017;Li et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019)], cell wall peroxidases [e.g.,(Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019)], and a general response to oxidative stress [e.g., (Sugimoto et al., 2014;Choi et al., 2019)] have all emerged as response signatures identified in some, but not all, plant spaceflight transcriptomes. However, the scale of the available data now poses challenges when making such comparisons between diverse experiments. Thus, (1) the datasets are distributed across multiple repositories, posing potential issues with accessibility and interoperability, (2) the bioinformatics-based analytical approaches used between published studies are often very different, making robust comparisons of differences drawn from the literature challenging, (3) the sheer scale of the data makes it hard to perform more than a few comparisons between experiments before its volume becomes limiting, and (4) it is often difficult to present these kinds of broad-scale comparative analyses in a visually accessible, intuitive manner for use by a broad scientific audience.To address these challenges, we have developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST; a compilation of the abbreviations and terms used throughout, along with a brief definition of each is presented as a glossary in theAppendix) database. TOAST uses a database management software called Qlik (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) to aggregate and visualize plant spaceflight omics-level data from multiple repositories. It applies a uniform set of analytical steps to the data and makes visualization of massive datasets accessible, allowing for interactive comparisons between experiments. The database also provides links to experiment metadata and a suite of online tools to enhance the scope of potential further analysis. In this publication we present an overview of the TOAST database and provide examples of how it can both validate previously published inferences as to likely spaceflight-imposed stress responses and mine across the plant spaceflight transcriptomics data to facilitate the generation of new hypotheses."

        "Title": "Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps regulate Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca\n2+\ninto the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca\n2+\nare recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca\n2+\ntransients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca\n2+\ntransporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca\n2+\ndynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca\n2+\n-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca\n2+\nfrom the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca\n2+\nsignaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout\naca4/11\nexhibited increased basal Ca\n2+\nlevels and Ca\n2+\nsignals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca\n2+\ndynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the\naca4/11\nseedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the\naca4/11\nphenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca\n2+\nsequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca\n2+\npumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.",

        "Title": "The fast and the furious: Rapid long-range signaling in plants.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants live in a complex and dynamic environment and thus have evolved systems that monitor multiple stimuli and then integrate this information into an appropriate plant-wide response. To accomplish this feat, plants require signaling systems driven by local stimulus perception and response combined with a communication network to broadcast this information throughout the plant body. In this way, responses to even highly localized stimuli, such as an insect chewing on one leaf, can play out in distant tissues. There are numerous chemical signaling molecules used to perform this systemic signaling ranging from mobile hormones and peptides to metabolites and RNAs. Additionally, evidence for a parallel informational system built around changes in ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and electrical signaling has begun to emerge. In this update, we will briefly introduce some recent ideas about the multiple, systemic communication pathways operating over different scales and timeframes within the plant. In particular, for the rapid ionic/ROS/electrical systemic signaling system, key progress has now been made in defining the molecular identities of some of the channels, pumps, and enzymes involved in driving signal propagation.AdvancesConfirmation of the extensive use of mobile peptide signaling in plants and identification of the protein kinases that act as their receptors adds important new context for understanding plant systemic signaling.Discovery that GLRs and CNGCs act as critical elements of the systemic wound VP/Ca2+signal provides a key anchor point from which to start building a mechanistic understanding of how systemic signaling is triggered and propagated.Defining the involvement of ROS as a central regulator of systemic signaling highlights a potentially central integrator of systemic responses.Development of technologies to visualize the ROS wave and Ca2+changes have provided a clearer understanding of the speed and patterning of systemic signaling within the plant.Cell-to-cell and long-range chemical signaling in plants: slow and steadyPlants have long been known to integrate their physiology and development through mobile chemical signals. The hormone auxin is a classic example, where the coordinated activity of membrane transporters such as the AUX/LAX, PIN, and ABCBs move auxin in a polar fashion from cell to adjacent cell (Grones and Friml, 2015). The auxin flux then provides both temporal and spatial information to the plant, e.g. driving local patterning within the developing vegetative meristem (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2020). In addition to hormones, various other regulators are also now known to similarly integrate development and physiology by moving from cell to adjacent cell. For example, in the root, the SHORTROOT protein must move from where it is made in the root xylem, procambium, and xylem-adjacent pericycle to other nearby cells, such as the phloem poles and quiescent center, where it then acts to, e.g. control phloem development (Kim et al., 2020).In addition to such systems providing relatively “local” communication between nearby cells and tissues, there are also a host of mobile signaling molecules that integrate activities over much larger distances within the plant, such as between organs. The polar transport of auxin once again provides an example of one kind of machinery for this long-range exchange of information. Thus, the movement of auxin across many cells within the shoot system allows the apical meristem to integrate its activities with axillary meristems through the process of apical dominance (Barbier et al., 2019), or enables the shoot to communicate with roots about its CO2environment (Zhou et al., 2019). In other cases, such long-distance communication systems are thought to use the mass flow within the vascular system to support their more rapid transport throughout the plant. Thus, movement of RNA, proteins, peptides, hormones, metabolites, and even nutrients within the xylem or phloem allows one part of the plant to communicate and coordinate its activities with distant organs (reviewed inHam and Lucas, 2017;Winter and Kragler, 2018). For example, Ca2+moving up in the transpiration stream may couple stomatal responses in the leaf to Ca2+supply from the roots (Han et al., 2003). This mobile Ca2+signal acts through a plastid-based receptor system in the guard cells that itself may further integrate these responses with, e.g. photoacclimation (Cutolo et al., 2019).The potential scope of the vasculature as an information highway for chemical messengers is exemplified by studies on the RNAs found to be mobile in the phloem. In addition to mRNAs, micro RNAs, silencing-induced RNAs, transfer RNAs, and even ribosomal RNAs are also found moving in phloem sap (Kehr and Kragler, 2018), with estimates of approximately 20% of the protein-coding RNAs found to move systemically. The presence of many of these RNAs in the translocation stream may reflect non-specific leakage of companion cell contents into sieve tubes (Calderwood et al., 2016) or remnants from sieve tube differentiation (Knoblauch et al., 2018). Even so, motifs such as transfer RNA-like sequences can tag RNAs for selective transport in the translocation stream (Zhang et al., 2016), and there does appear to be selectivity in the macromolecules found to be moving within the phloem (Garg and Kühn, 2020).Of note in systemic signals moving in the xylem and phloem is the rising profile of mobile peptides as a theme in how plants integrate their activities between organs. Systemin was discovered as the first plant (wound) signaling peptide several decades ago (Pearce et al., 1991), and now small secreted peptides are known to underlie a host of developmental and physiological responses ranging from guard cell differentiation and meristem function to gravitropism (reviewed inMatsubayashi, 2014;Blackburn et al., 2020). This recent characterization of the extent of such mobile peptide signaling by the plant, along with defining the array of plasma membrane receptor-like kinases that underlie many of their perception machineries (reviewed inChen et al., 2020), represents an important and exciting recent step forward in our understanding of plant systemic signals.For example, an array of peptides released to the vascular system in the root are now known to carry information such as drought (CLAVATA3/ESR-related 25 peptide;Takahashi et al., 2018) or nitrate status (C-terminally encoded peptides; CEPs;Tabata et al., 2014) to the aerial parts of the plant. In the case of nitrogen signaling, CEP DOWNSTREAM peptides (Ohkubo et al., 2017) appear to complete the circuit, carrying information from the shoot to the roots through the phloem. Although CEP and CEP DOWNSTREAM are integral to coordinating plant-wide nitrate responses, plants likely use multiple parallel signals in these long-range communication systems. For example, the plant hormone cytokinin is known to operate alongside these peptide signals in the systemic nitrogen status signaling network (Ruffel et al., 2016;Poitout et al., 2018).Undoubtedly, such chemical exchanges of information between adjacent cells and through the vascular highways explain many key components of the systemic signaling occurring within the plant. However, the speed seen in the plant’s internal communications suggests additional signaling networks must be operating. Auxin moves through the plant at rates of only micrometers per second (Kramer et al., 2011) and small molecules passing through plasmodesmata likely travel at a similar speed (e.g.Rutschow et al., 2011). Although mass transport in the xylem or phloem is much faster, typically in the 200–400 µm/s range (e.g.Peuke et al., 2001;Savage et al., 2013;Knoblauch et al., 2016), systemic signals to, e.g. wounding or high light stress can move at rates in excess of 1,000 µm/s (Table 1and see below). Systems using self-reinforcing waves of ROS, Ca2+, electrical, and potentially even hydraulic signals are thought to support this much more rapid propagation of systemic information.Table 1.Some examples of the speeds of systemic propagation of signals described in the textOrganismStimulusSignalSpeedNumber of 50-µm cells/sReferenceVenus flytrapTouchAP54–115 mm/s1,080–2,300(Sibaoka, 1966)M. pudica(rachilla)TouchAP3–7 mm/s60–140(Sibaoka, 1966)M. pudica(petiole)TouchAP6–44 mm/s120–880(Sibaoka, 1966)M. pudica(petiole)WoundVP1–4 mm/s20–80(Houwink, 1935)ArabidopsisWoundVP vasculature1–2 mm/s20–40(Mousavi et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2018)VP mesophyll0.4 mm/s8(Mousavi et al., 2013)Ca2+wave vasculature1–2 mm/s20–40(Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018)Ca2+wave mesophyll0.4 mm/s8(Toyota et al., 2018)ROS wave vasculature∼1 mm/s20(Miller et al., 2009;Lew et al., 2020)ROS wave mesophyll0.4 mm/s8(Lew et al., 2020)ArabidopsisNaClCa2+wave root0.4 mm/s8(Choi et al., 2014)Open in a new tabFor context, the speed has also been converted to the number of 50-µm plant cells that the signal would be able to traverse in a single second.Rapid systemic signaling: the need for speedThe rapid systemic signaling and response in leaf movements of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) provide a dramatic illustration of how fast plant systemic signals can travel. The Venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant that traps insects between two modified leaves that are joined at the base by a hinge that allows them to snap together to form a cage. The adaxial surface of each leaf possesses exquisitely sensitive sensory hairs that, when mechanically stimulated, trigger the trap to close (Scherzer et al., 2019). The hairs activate distant motor cells in the hinge region that levers the two halves of the trap together in approximately 100 ms (Forterre et al., 2005). This speed is required by the plant in order to catch fast moving insects, but how is it achieved? A combination of the elastic structure of the lobes of the trap and rapid turgor-driven changes in motor cell volume drive the physical movements of the trap lobes (Forterre et al., 2005), but what mediates the rapid communication from the sensory hair to the motor cells? The signal is electrical, i.e. mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair generates a transient depolarization of the membrane potential (an action potential, AP) in the cells at its base that propagates throughout the leaf at the rate of 54–115 mm/s. It is the arrival of this AP at the lobe that triggers the leaf closure (Sibaoka, 1966).Similarly, the sensitive plantM. pudicafolds its leaflets and moves its petioles quickly (∼1 s) in response to a variety of mechanical and other physical stimuli (Hagihara and Toyota, 2020). Again, the movements are driven by a turgor-powered motor, in this case an organ called the pulvinus, and the rapid signaling appears linked to propagating electrical signals. Non-damaging stimuli (e.g. cold shock or touch) generate an AP that transmits through the plant and then induces the leaflets to move upon its arrival at the tertiary pulvinus (Figure 1, A;Sibaoka, 1966). The AP propagates at 3–7 mm/s in the rachilla (the shaft to which the leaflets are attached) and 6–44 mm/s in the petiole at the base of the whole compound leaf structure (Sibaoka, 1966). These electrical signals are likely moving through the sieve tubes and the parenchyma cells in the protoxylem and phloem (Sibaoka, 1962;Samejima and Sibaoka, 1983;Fromm and Eschrich, 1988). By contrast, damaging stimuli (e.g. cutting or burning leaflets) generates both the AP and an additional electrical signal called a variation potential (VP, also known as a slow wave potential;Figure 1, B;Houwink, 1935). The VP appears to be related to the flow of stimulating chemicals in the xylem vessels and propagates at the rate of 1–4 mm/s in the petiole (Houwink, 1935), i.e. more slowly than that of the AP. Moreover, the existence of a non-electrical (possibly hydraulic), even faster signal is also implied (Houwink, 1935;Malone, 1994). Thus, when the entire organ is strongly damaged (e.g. pruning off of a collection of leaflets or pinna), the primary pulvinus and petiole move earlier than the arrival of either the APs or VPs (Houwink, 1935). In addition, when leaflets are extensively damaged by burning, the thickness of distant leaves is almost immediately changed by a signal moving in excess of 15 mm/s (Figure 1, B; Malone, 1994), possibly linked to wound-related pressure changes propagating through the vasculature. Thus, physical damage that breaks the integrity of the xylem is expected to release the tension in these vessels and due to the relatively incompressible nature of water, this pressure change will be almost instantly transmitted through the vasculature. Indeed, such a hydraulic wave has been proposed to mediate wounding events in a range of plants, where it is thought to propagate through the xylem and potentially phloem vessels. The pressure wave may act to either disperse a stimulating chemical from the wounded tissues or directly trigger mechanically responsive signaling systems within the systemic tissues (e.g.Boari and Malone, 1993;Farmer et al., 2014;Evans and Morris, 2017). However, such hydraulic effects are thought likely to move at speeds up to 100,000-fold faster than the observed propagation of wound-induced electrical and Ca2+signals, making it complex to relate their kinetics to these other systemic signals (Evans and Morris, 2017). The action of hydraulic signals transmitted through the plant vasculature represents a rapid signaling mechanism seemingly well-tailored to plant anatomy. However, definitively showing such a mechanism in action has been, and remains, a significant challenge in experimental design. For excellent discussions of this area, seeEvans and Morris (2017)andFarmer et al. (2020).Figure 1.Open in a new tabRapid signaling and response in Mimosa. A, Non-wounding stimulus (ice, 0 s) causes rapid movement of leaflets driven by turgor changes in the pulvini at their bases. Cold shock generates only an AP (orange arrows) that cannot propagate past the secondary pulvinus at the base of a pinna (20 s), leading to a local response of the stimulated pinna only. B, Damage (flame, 0 s) triggers rapid closing of a leaf. Such damage causes a putative hydraulic wave (blue arrows), a rapidly propagating AP (orange arrows), and a slower moving VP (red arrows). Once these signals arrive at the pulvinus, movements of ions and water cause changes in pulvinar cell volume that in turn causes the leaf to move.Channels, pumps, and systemic signalsJust as for the potential hydraulic signal, the electrical signals that appear central to the rapid systemic signaling in Dionaea and Mimosa are thought to play similar roles in fast, long-distance communication within many plants. For example, an insect chewing on a leaf causes both APs and VPs propagating from the damaged leaf toward distal sites in many species (e.g.Mousavi et al., 2013;Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014). Importantly, being able to study these phenomena in Arabidopsis has allowed the field to begin to define the machineries driving these changes with molecular precision.Plants maintain an approximately −200 mV potential across their plasma membranes, largely through the action of ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Tester, 1990). Propagating changes in this potential, as seen in Mimosa and Dionaea, may act as signals to rapidly carry information throughout many plants. APs are transient depolarization and repolarization events with set amplitude, velocity, and durations that last on the scale of seconds (Figure 2, A;e.g.Favre et al., 2001;Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, VPs are characterized by variable initial amplitude and a much slower repolarization (sometimes with superimposed spikes similar to APs) that last for minutes (Figure 2, B). VPs also differ from APs in that the shape of their change in potential over time, and their velocity are dependent on the intensity of the triggering stimulus and decrease with distance from the location of their initiation (Fromm and Lautner, 2007;Sukhov et al., 2013;Vodeneev et al., 2016). Thus, VPs have the potential to encode information about the strength and distance of the stimulus that triggered them, whereas APs have the characteristics of an all-or-nothing, rapid, long-range signal. Both VPs and APs reflect the fluxes of ions that cause both depolarization and successive repolarization of the plasma membrane. Therefore, such electrical signaling is intimately related to the regulation of membrane ion channels, pumps, and other transporters. The recent elucidation of the molecular identities of some of these components has proven a key step forward in our understanding how systemic signals may be propagating.Figure 2.Open in a new tabPlant electrical/ionic systemic signaling. A, Change in electrical potential of an AP is characterized by a short depolarization followed by a repolarization. B, Change in electrical potential of a VP is typified by a sharp depolarization and slow repolarization often with AP-like spikes superimposed. The magnitude of the VP diminishes with distance from the originating stimulus. C, Model for possible series of events related to wound-induced VP and Ca2+wave. Dashed lines represent speculative regulatory activities. Cation channel activation (through ROS and/or ligand binding) triggers Ca2+influx with contributions from CNGCs and potentially from plasma membrane-localized GLRs. The molecular identity of the proposed ROS-activated Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane channel in this system remains unknown. GLRs on internal membranes, along with TPC1 on the tonoplast, may be operating in an amplification system that reinforces the cytosolic Ca2+change. When coupled with Cl−efflux and inactivation of H+-ATPases, these events lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Ca2+-dependent processes would be likely candidates to coordinate these activities but precise molecular machineries await to be defined. The accompanying rise in apoplastic pH from inhibition of the H+-ATPase further activates putative GLR Ca2+conductances at the plasma membrane. The resultant cytoplasmic Ca2+elevation should then lead to activation of RBOHs and further apoplastic ROS production, and thus to a feed-forward loop supporting cell-to-cell propagation of the signal. D, Slow influx of ROS into the cytosol via aquaporins could then inactivate TPC1, inhibiting the cytosolic Ca2+amplifier. Repolarization would then be driven by H+-ATPase reactivation and K+release, restoring the membrane potential. A reduction in apoplastic pH would inhibit GLR activity, further contributing to the resetting of the system.The glutamate receptor-like channelsWhereas it has long been known that fluxes of Ca2+, K+, Cl−, and H+are all contributing to the production of APs and VPs (Figure 2, C and D;Vodeneev et al., 2016), the specific channels and pumps involved have only just begun to be defined. We currently have perhaps the most detailed model for channel involvement in the systemic wound response in Arabidopsis, where cation channels of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been confirmed to be integral to generating VPs. The GLRs are ligand- (amino acid-) gated, non-selective (Na+and Ca2+permeable; e.g.Wudick et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2020) cation channels, with 20 isoforms in Arabidopsis. Mutants inGLRs 3.1,3.2,3.3, and3.6disrupt the duration of the wound-related VP in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). The associated systemic cytosolic Ca2+signal (Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2020), spread by a systemic increase in ROS (Lew et al., 2020; and see below) and electrical signaling in the phloem (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014), are also disrupted by mutations inGLR3.3andGLR3.6(Figure 3, A), suggesting a role for GLRs in the cation influx during the depolarization phase of the wound-triggered VP. Wound-induced APs and local wound-triggered Ca2+increases are still generated in the directly damaged leaves in these mutants; however, they fail to propagate throughout the plant (Salvador-Recatalà et al., 2014;Hedrich et al., 2016;Toyota et al., 2018), implying their role in events specifically related to VP propagation. In contrast, GLR3.5 is thought to act to limit the extent of electrical signaling, with mutants in this channel showing much more extensive spread of damage-induced APs (Salvador-Recatalà, 2016). Similarly, GLR3.1 may play a role in determining the extent of the spread of systemic Ca2+increases across distal leaves (Nguyen et al., 2018). This role for GLRs in systemic signaling does not appear limited to Arabidopsis. For example, a CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutation that prematurely stops translation of the AtGLR 3.6 ortholog in tomato (Solanum-lycopersicum; SlGLR3.5) blocks wound-induced systemic VPs and increases in ROS (Wang et al., 2019). Mutations in eight other Arabidopsis GLRs tested byMousavi et al. (2013)did not have a significant effect on the dynamics of wound-triggered VPs, suggesting specificity within the GLRs for activities in the systemic electrical signaling system. However, as a note of caution, it takes a double mutant in both GLR3.3 and 3.6 to effectively ablate the wound-induced Ca2+wave and VP. Therefore, we must await a systematic analysis of the role(s) of the GLRs alone, and in combination, to robustly define how much of the temporal and spatial dynamics of systemic signaling can be explained by the actions of this channel family.Figure 3.Open in a new tabModel for systemic wound signaling in Arabidopsis. A, Local wounding rapidly triggers production of JA in the directly damaged tissues and also in distant tissues. JA signaling then triggers both local and systemic anti-herbivory defenses. Damage at the wound site (putatively signaled by release of glutamate from damaged cells;Toyota et al., 2018) triggers VP propagation and a wave of increased ROS and Ca2+that moves through the vasculature to distal leaves where it spreads through plasmodesmatal connections to trigger systemic defenses (Toyota et al., 2018). Transmission is dependent on the action of the GLR ion channels and the plasma membrane H+pump AHA1. B and C, In the systemic leaves, the Ca2+rise in the nucleus of target cells triggers phosphorylation of the JAV1 transcriptional inhibitor in a calmodulin-dependent manner. This change then targets JAV1 for ubiquitinylation by the JUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26S proteasome. Loss of JAV1 disrupts the inhibitory complex it forms with WRKY51/JAZ8, relieving transcriptional repression ofAOS, which is an enzyme integral to JA biosynthesis. Arabidopsis image: modified from Eric Belfield, Eurekalert.org.GLRs 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6 have been reported in a range of subcellular sites in plants, including the ER, tonoplast, and plasma membrane (e.g.Singh et al., 2016;Nguyen et al., 2018;Wudick et al., 2018), suggesting a potentially complex interaction of organellar signaling machineries and the plasma membrane ion fluxes behind VPs. These channels are also expressed in different cell types in aerial tissues, with e.g. GLR3.6 (and GLR3.1) being predominantly produced in xylem contact cells (xylem parenchyma cells adjacent to the conducting vessels) and GLR3.3 in the phloem sieve tubes (Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018). One explanation for the observations that mutating both GLR3.3 and 3.6 is required to fully ablate systemic wound signals, even though they are in different cell types, is the presence of a putative electro-osmotic signal that couples hydraulic changes in the xylem and phloem during propagation of the systemic wound signal (Farmer et al., 2020). Alternatively, two independent systemic wound signaling pathways may be operating in the vascular tissues: one in the xylem mediated by GLR3.6 and one in the phloem using GLR3.3, where each is sufficient to trigger a systemic wound response on its own.Other candidate channels in systemic signaling networksIn addition to the GLRs, there are a host of other promising candidates for systemic signaling-related channel activities such as the Ca2+permeable CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNELs (CNGCs). CNGCs are a family of 20 cation channels reported to be found on both the plasma and internal membranes. CNGCs have already been linked to responses to stimuli that are known to trigger systemic signaling, such as heat stress, wounding, or pathogen attack (e.g.Ali et al., 2007;Meena et al., 2019;Tian et al., 2019;Jogawat et al., 2020). Indeed, CNGC19 has been shown to be a Ca2+-permeable, plasma membrane- (Meena et al., 2019) and possibly vacuolar-localized (Yuen and Christopher, 2013) channel required for propagation of the systemic wound-induced Ca2+signal across the wounded leaf (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, mutants in this gene show a failure to efficiently transmit the wound-triggered Ca2+wave within the damaged leaf, and are also compromised in plant-wide defenses against insect herbivory (Meena et al., 2019). Whether the CNGC family as a whole plays as integral a role in these systemic events as the GLRs appear to do remains to be investigated.K+channels are also thought to be integral elements of electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D), but again, we have only just scratched the surface as far as analyses of their potential role(s) in systemic signal propagation. Mutants in the ubiquitously expressed GUARD CELL OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+channel (GORK) do have altered kinetics of membrane depolarization and repolarization and generate altered dynamics of APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By comparison, although mutants in the ubiquitously expressed ARABIDOPSIS K+TRANSPORTER 2 (AKT2) do not alter AP characteristics, they do reduce the proportion of plants that produce stimulus-evoked APs (Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, the STELAR OUTWARD RECTIFYING K+channel (SKOR), a close relative of GORK that is expressed in the vasculature (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010), does not appear to play a role in wound-related VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013).Similar to this limited knowledge of systemic signaling-related cation channels, the channels and transporters moving anions such as Cl−across the plasma membrane during systemic electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D) also remain to be fully explored. Thus, although the anion channels CLC-b (tonoplast;von der Fecht-Bartenbach et al., 2010) and CLC-e (thylakoid;Herdean et al., 2016) do not appear to be involved in wound-induced systemic VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013), the roles of other plant anion channels in systemic signaling are yet to be characterized.H+pumpsH+-ATPases have long been known to be inactivated during the depolarization phase and then reactivated during the repolarization phase of electrical signal propagation (Vodeneev et al., 2016). However, the specific H+-ATPases involved have only recently begun to be defined. In Arabidopsis, there are 12 H+-ATPases (AHAs) with AHA1-5 and -11 showing widespread expression throughout the plant. AHA1 (predominately shoot) and -2 (predominately root) are especially highly expressed (Gaxiola et al., 2007). Mutants in AHA1, -2, and -3 were not originally thought to play roles in wound-induced VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013). However, recent analysis has shown that AHA1 is involved in repolarization of the plasma membrane following a wound-induced VP (Kumari et al., 2019). Additionally, inaha1, the duration of the wound-triggered systemic Ca2+signal is extended, providing further mechanistic links between the Ca2+wave, ion fluxes, and VP propagation. The GLRs themselves are regulated by pH (Shao et al., 2020), providing a further link between H+pumping and Ca2+signal. Direct wounding is accompanied by cytosolic acidification, suggesting a likely coupled apoplastic alkalinization (Behera et al., 2018) that would be predicted to activate plasma membrane-localized GLRs (Shao et al., 2020). However, precisely how cytosolic and apoplastic pH change as systemic signals propagate and how this might relate to the activity of GLRs potentially acting in organelles as well as at the plasma membrane remains to be defined.aha2mutants do not show equivalent disruption of the wound VP, suggesting that only specific H+-ATPases may be involved in supporting these kinds of electrical signals (Kumari et al., 2019). The AHAs are known to controlled by a complex network of elements, including interaction with lipids, ions, protein kinases, and regulators such as 14-3-3 proteins (Falhof et al., 2016). Considering its central role in wound VP dynamics, defining how the factors controlling AHA1 activity relate to the generation of VPs could offer important insight into the underlying regulatory networks driving propagation of systemic signals.Thus, there are some tantalizing clues as to how channels and pumps may make contributions to different aspects of systemic signals, such as to their thresholds or dynamics of propagation. However, we must await a much more comprehensive exploration of the role(s) of the large number of candidate channels, pumps, and exchangers to build a picture of the network of elements that are supporting the fluxes of ions that underlie the systemic signaling network.ROS: The great integrator?In addition to Ca2+waves and electrical signals, plants additionally employ waves of ROS (seeBox 1) as part of their systemic signaling apparatus. These waves are likely being maintained through a ROS-induced ROS release machinery (reviewed inZandalinas and Mittler, 2018). As seen for systemic electrical signals and the Ca2+wave, the ROS wave can propagate through both vascular and nonvascular tissues, depending on the stimulus (Fichman et al., 2019;Lew et al., 2020). For example, a wound-induced wave of ROS accumulation and response has been seen to move at speeds in excess of 1 mm/s throughout the vasculature in aerial parts of Arabidopsis (Miller et al., 2009;Fichman et al., 2019;Lew et al., 2020), or at ∼400 µm/s in non-vascular tissues of the root (Evans et al., 2016) and leaves (Lew et al., 2020; seeTable 1andChoi et al. [2016]for summary of propagation speeds). In Arabidopsis, these propagating ROS signals appear dependent on RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE D (RBOHD) and RBOHF (Zandalinas et al., 2020), both plasma membrane, ROS-producing NADPH oxidases known to be central to a range of signaling systems from pathogen defense to drought (Kadota et al., 2015). The ROS wave is detected as both ROS production in the apoplast (Evans et al., 2016;Lew et al., 2020)—as expected for the product of RBOH action—and in the cytoplasm (Miller et al., 2009;Fichman et al., 2019;Zandalinas et al., 2020). The observation of cytoplasmic changes implies either RBOH-derived apoplastic ROS subsequently enter the cell across the plasma membrane, likely through aquaporins (Bienert et al., 2007;Dynowski et al., 2008), or that another, cytoplasmic ROS producing system is also being engaged by the systemic signaling network.Box 1.What are the RBOHs and ROS?The Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) are a family of NADPH oxidases. Their enzymatic activity is to take an electron from cytosolic NADPH and transfer it across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen to produce the superoxide radical (seeBox 1figure). Superoxide dismutases then act on this highly chemically reactive species to produce the much more stable H2O2that can be further processed by catalase to produce water and oxygen (Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Superoxide and H2O2are both forms of ROS, reactive chemical species that contain oxygen. Other ROS include the hydroxyl radical, peroxides, and singlet oxygen. ROS are produced during reactions within the cell and can cause damage to biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids due to their highly reactive nature. However, ROS are also used by biology as ubiquitous signaling agents. For example, in Arabidopsis, HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE INDUCED Ca2+INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) is a plasma membrane leucine-rich receptor kinase that was recently discovered to link H2O2perception in the apoplast to Ca2+signaling in the cytoplasm (Wu et al., 2020).The Arabidopsis RBOH family shows regulation by a host of modulators such as a wide range of kinases (including members of the calcium-dependent protein kinase [CDPK] and Calcineurin B-Like/CBL interacting protein kinase [CBL/CIPK] families), small GTPases, and the lipid-based signal phosphatidic acid (e.g.Kadota et al., 2015;Qu et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2020). Of note, the CDPKs, the CBL/CIPKs, and the RBOHs themselves are all directly regulated by Ca2+. Further, the stability of the RBOHD regulating BOTRYTUS INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) is modulated through Ca2+-dependent regulation of CDPK action (Monaghan et al., 2014). Thus, RBOH-based ROS production should be inextricably linked with Ca2+dynamics. Indeed, mathematical modeling byEvans et al. (2016)supports the idea that it is the interaction of ROS-induced Ca2+influx at the plasma membrane with the direct and indirect Ca2+regulation of the RBOHs that sustains cell-to-cell propagation of both the Ca2+and ROS waves.A direct mechanistic relationship of ROS to the propagating systemic electrical signal remains less clear. In addition to ROS production, RBOHs should alter both apoplastic pH and membrane potential as they move an electron from cytosolic NADPH to the apoplast in order to generate the superoxide radical (seeBox 1;Segal, 2016). However, whether the magnitude of these effects is at all significant relative to the activity of channels and pumps driving electrical changes at the plasma membrane is unclear. There are also a number of identified channels and electrophysiologically measured membrane conductances where ROS regulation has either been inferred or directly monitored, including SKOR, GORK, the annexins, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1; see below), and the CNGCs (reviewed inDemidchik, 2018), providing hints at how ROS could modulate electrical signaling phenomena. RBOHD function is known to be required for the systemic propagation of high light- or heat stress-induced VPs (Suzuki et al., 2013); however, a mutant inRBOHDdid not alter wound-triggered VP characteristics in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a RBOH mutant in tomato does abolish wound-induced, root-to-shoot VP transmission (Wang et al., 2019). Recent experiments driving tissue-specific RBOHD expression in therbohDknockout background suggests that systemic signaling to local high-light stress requires this enzyme to be located in the xylem parenchyma or phloem (Zandalinas et al., 2020). These are the same tissues where GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are expressed and are required for systemic wound signaling via VPs and Ca2+(Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018). Such observations reinforce the idea that plants are likely employing complex and multifaceted propagation mechanisms that may vary from organ to organ or stimulus to stimulus.ROS, RBOHD, and systemic signaling: it’s complicatedThe RBOHs are multigene families in plants. For example, in Arabidopsis, there are eight other RBOH isoforms in addition to RBOHs D and F. Similarly, although the NADPH oxidases have received the most attention as components of this ROS-based systemic signaling network, ROS dynamics are in reality modulated by a much more complex interplay of ROS producing, degrading, and scavenging processes, including respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport and photorespiration, enzymatic systems involving superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidases, catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, as well as the action of non-enzymatic scavengers such as glutathione, ascorbic acid, and flavonoids (Mittler et al., 2004;Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Further, specific receptors for ROS, such as HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INCUCED Ca2+INCREASE 1 (HPCA1) are beginning to be defined (Wu et al., 2020). Dissecting the potential roles of these other ROS-related elements in systemic signaling systems remains an important goal for future research as it offers the possibility to provide some of the missing linkages between Ca2+, ROS, and electrical responses.Propagation of systemic signals also implies a directionality to their transmission and here ROS regulation of tonoplast channels could play a role. Thus, the systemic spread of both the wound- (Kiep et al., 2015) and NaCl- (Choi et al., 2014) driven systemic Ca2+increases is known to involve the action of a tonoplast channel, TPC1. Activation of RBOHs produces apoplastic ROS that are then expected to trigger ion fluxes (such as Ca2+influx) at the plasma membrane by gating currently unidentified channels (Demidchik, 2018). TPC1 is then thought to act either directly or indirectly to facilitate Ca2+release from the vacuole, providing an amplifier for the initial cytosolic Ca2+increases (Figure 2). The resulting elevated cytosolic Ca2+could then further trigger RBOH activation, and so cause propagation of the signal from cell to cell (Choi et al., 2014;Evans et al., 2016). TPC1 is inhibited by cytosolic ROS (Pottosin et al., 2009), suggesting a mechanism whereby the initial ROS produced by RBOH activation could enter the cell to inhibit TPC1, leading to a refractory period for the calcium-induced calcium release amplifier. The time delay between activation of the RBOH/TPC1 system and ROS-dependent TPC1 inactivation would then lead to the propagating, wave front-like character to the transmission events. However, although mutants inTPC1disrupt systemic wound defense responses, local wound-induced Ca2+increases are not altered (Kiep et al., 2015;Lenglet et al., 2017). In addition, although experimental addition of ROS does trigger Ca2+increases, the resulting elevated Ca2+and ROS levels do not propagate systemically (Miller et al., 2009;Evans et al., 2016), suggesting the model described above is likely missing some important elements. For example, TPC1 appears to act in concert with TANDEM PORE K+Channel 1 (TPK1) and -3 to mediate electrical excitability of the tonoplast (Jaślan et al., 2019). However, TPK1 and -3 are not thought to play roles in wound-induced VP dynamics (Mousavi et al., 2013). Clearly, we are just at the beginning of unraveling the complexities and capabilities of the vacuole as a signaling hub.Systemic responses: what happens at the finish line?Following the propagation of a signal, the response in the distal tissues ranges from the physiological, such as rapid systemic stomatal responses (e.g.Devireddy et al., 2020;Ehonen et al., 2020), alterations in photosynthetic activity (Guo et al., 2016), and leaf movements (Kurenda et al., 2019), to the molecular, with shifts in metabolites (Suzuki et al., 2013;Choudhury et al., 2018), hormone levels (e.g.Glauser et al., 2009;Koo et al., 2009;Toyota et al., 2018), and gene expression levels (Suzuki et al., 2015;Zandalinas et al., 2019). For example, in Arabidopsis, local high-light exposure to a single Arabidopsis leaf triggers a systemic change in metabolites such as glucose, sucrose, and glycine within minutes, and a suite of transcriptional changes within seconds (Suzuki et al., 2013;Suzuki et al., 2015;Choudhury et al., 2018;Zandalinas et al., 2019). Both these metabolic and transcriptional phenomena are dependent on the action of RBOHD, again suggesting an integral role for ROS in the signaling system. However, precisely where the ROS are operating in the circuitry of signal generation, propagation, and rapid response remains to be fully defined.Wound-induced JA production: integrating Ca2+and wound signaling responsesThe response to the arrival of the systemic VP and Ca2+signal triggered by wounding provides one example of the molecular machinery whereby systemic signaling molecules may be fairly directly turned into the target cell response. In this case, the systemic effect is a rapid (within minutes) increase in the level of the wound hormone jasmonic acid (JA;Glauser et al., 2009;Koo et al., 2009;Toyota et al., 2018). Once the Ca2+increase arrives at the systemic tissues, it activates the Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein calmodulin, which in turn activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1;Figure 3, B and C;Yan et al., 2018). JAV1 is part of a repressor complex that along with JAZ8 and WRKY51 inhibits expression ofALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS; encoding a key enzyme in JA biosynthesis). The phosphorylation of JAV1 causes this complex to dissociate and triggers JAV1 ubiquitinylation via the E3-ubiquitin ligase JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE 1 (JUL1), targeting JAV1 for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The disruption of the inhibitory complex removes repression ofAOStranscription and so leads to JA production. There are seven calmodulin genes in Arabidopsis, which encode only four different proteins (CaM1/4, -2/3/5, -6, and -7).In plantaJAV1 interacts strongly with CaM1/4 and CaM7, but not with the others (Yan et al., 2018). CaM7 differs from CaM6 and CaM2/3/5 by a single, but different, amino acid, suggesting an exquisitely tailored protein–protein interaction underlies response to the arrival of the systemic Ca2+signal in this system. Further, as discussed above, CNGC19 plays a role in propagating the wound-induced Ca2+wave. This channel is also thought to be regulated by CaM, but in this case the CaM2 isoform (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, different CaMs appear to be allowing the plant to both respond to the propagating Ca2+signal by supporting its transmission and also to translate this same Ca2+wave to the triggering of systemic JA-mediated defenses once it arrives at its target."

For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.\nSubject terms:\nDatabases, Physiology, Plant sciences, Microbiology, Molecular biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe space environment introduces organisms to a unique range of challenges. For example, for humans the closed environment of space vehicles alongside enforced confinement, and the isolation inherent in the vast distances traveled all have important impacts on the functioning of the crew’s physiology and psychology (Fig.1). Many of these effects are being explored in Earth-based analogs, such as the Hawaii Space Analog and Simulation and the Scientific International Research in Unique Terrestrial Station missions1,2. However, some features of space are complex or impossible to simulate on the Earth’s surface, requiring exploration through the relatively rare opportunity of a spaceflight experiment. For example, exposure to sustained microgravity and to the increased ionizing radiation in space are both beyond the experience of terrestrial biology, and currently almost impossible to mimic on the Earth’s surface. Thus, their individual and combined effects on biology remain poorly understood, yet these are likely to be critical factors in how organisms respond to living in space.Fig. 1. Physical and biological factors affecting human space exploration and their associated stressors including isolation, long confinement in closed environments, microgravity, and ionizing radiation.Open in a new tabThese factors are likely to act both alone and in combination to impose effects on the crew in space.A combination of the shielding effects of the atmosphere and the ability of the magnetosphere to deflect radiation around the planet means, that for most of Earth’s history its organisms have been relatively protected from space radiation. Although terrestrial life does encounter natural background radiation from geological sources and UV radiation from the Sun, it is low by comparison to space, with an average annual dose equivalent per person in the US of around 6 mSv3, depending on altitude and soil composition (e.g., the presence of minerals that produce radon gas). In deep space, the radiation exposures will be much higher and include highly ionizing single particles not normally found on Earth. Based on data from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during its cruise phase from Earth to Mars and the measurements it made on the Martian surface, the crew on a ~1000 day mission to Mars, assuming “quiet” periods of solar activity throughout, would receive ~360 mGy absorbed dose, much of it from highly ionizing galactic cosmic ray (GCR) ions4,5. This is similar to several decades of absorbed background dose on Earth, but as noted, from a very different spectrum of radiation and delivered at a very different dose rate. All of these factors are likely to play into the precise effects this radiation exposure will have on the crew of such a mission, making it complex to extrapolate from terrestrial models to the spaceflight environment.Indeed, the effects of exposure to space radiation have been shown to induce more deleterious effects in tissues than similar doses of ionizing radiation on Earth, with, e.g., as much as 40 times more biological effectiveness to induce Harderian gland cancers in mice6. However, in addition to inducing cancer, radiation exposure in mammals can lead to a wide array of cellular and microenvironment effects such as chronic inflammation, tissue degeneration and impaired nerve function (e.g., refs.7,8). Indeed, all organisms are subject to radiation effects, with animals, microbes, and plants experiencing a variety of radiation-induced cellular events ranging from DNA damage and oxidative stress to shifts in metabolism9,10. Different species exhibit varying degrees of radiation tolerance and within a species radiation response is modulated by an individual’s genetics11–14. For example, bacteria in the genus Deinococcus can survive radiation doses far in excess of those that would be lethal in humans15. Predicting such effects are further confounded by the influence of the spaceflight environment, such as living in microgravity, which itself modulates an organism’s radiation response (e.g., refs.16–18). These complexities in potential biological effects coupled with the relatively limited opportunities to perform direct spaceflight experiments make assessing the risks of radiation exposure to crew members on extended, deep space missions extremely difficult19,20. Yet, as the duration and distances of spaceflight missions increase, the question of how different organisms respond to the effects of increased space radiation exposure and the potential for interactions with, e.g., the microgravity of spaceflight becomes increasingly important to address.To date, much biology-focused spaceflight experimentation has been published without its associated radiation data and though radiation exposure has usually been recorded, it is often not readily accessible. This gap has been recognized by the NASA GeneLab project, which acts as a repository for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from experiments flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors21–23. Alongside the raw omics datasets, the GeneLab data repository organizes associated metadata into a publicly accessible database called the GeneLab Data System (GLDS21,22). Mining of GeneLab’s omics data then enables exploration of the network of molecular responses to space environments as a function of experimental factors described in the metadata. GeneLab has now aggregated much of the radiation metadata associated with its spaceflight-related datasets24. In other words, the GLDS now provides the raw materials of data and metadata for making broad inferences about radiation effects across multiple sets of spaceflight experiments and in different organisms. The GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) also enables access to these data by external web applications, with the aim of allowing the scientific community to deploy custom tools to visualize and explore these data in ways complementary to the capabilities available in GeneLab’s own data visualization portal.In the work presented here, we introduce one such custom visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astro-rad-bio-app). Rad-Bio-App capitalizes on the “FAIRness” standards and rich data curation of the GLDS25to provide an interactive graphical interface through which investigators can visualize, filter, and compare radiation dosimetry and other metadata across the GLDS. The reiterative filtering capabilities of Rad-Bio-App further allow the user to define datasets with potentially common radiation effects, or to explore interactions between radiation exposure and a variety of space-related experimental conditions. These datasets then provide targets for further in-depth analyses using a variety of bioinformatics-related tools.Overall design and goals of the Rad-Bio-AppThe overall goal of the Rad-Bio-App is to allow users to develop filtered, curated lists of omics datasets within the GeneLab data repository, that can then be explored for predicted radiation-related responses. Therefore, documenting the origin of such data is of paramount importance and is central to the Rad-Bio-App’s data structure outlined in Fig.2. Sources of these spaceflight datasets include experiments performed on the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), satellites (including the Russian Bion and Foton) and the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Ground data are typically from experiments that use terrestrial radiation sources such as particle accelerators and gamma, x-ray, and neutron sources. We have also incorporated summary information from high altitude balloons on Earth26and orbital and surface data from the Moon, from the journey from Earth to Mars and from the Martian surface by importing data from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)27, the RAD instrument of the Mars Science Laboratory4,5,28, the Lunar Lander Neutrons and Dosimetry (LND) experiment mounted on the Chang’E 4 lunar lander29–31and aggregate data from the Apollo astronauts’ Radiation Survey Meters (RSM)32. CRaTER provides data on radiation in lunar orbit and LND for the lunar surface. The RAD measured radiation exposure while both in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface. Supplementary Table1presents a summary of these balloon, lunar and Mars-related data.Fig. 2. Rad-Bio-App’s data structure.Open in a new tabRad-Bio-App imports datasets from ground-based space radiation simulations, spaceflight experiments, the RAD detector of the Curiosity Rover, the CRaTER instrument on the lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the LRD of the Chang’E 4 lunar lander, the RaD-X high altitude balloon and dosimetry from Apollo missions. These datasets are linked in a relational database within the Qlik data management system. At the time of writing, the App contains data from 132 accessions, each with associated metadata including: Accession #, GeneLab GLDS-Accession #, Radiation Sub-Accession (individual GLDS accessions contain data from multiple treatments, which we define as sub-accessions and denote as GLDS#.#, e.g., GLDS-93.1, GLDS-93.2 etc.), organism, analysis type (trancriptomics, genomics, metabolomics etc.), radiation type, particle charge, particle mass, radiation source, particle LET (keV/µm), energy (MeV classified to ions, gamma-rays, or x-rays), minimal radiation group, total absorbed radiation dose (Gy), summary dose rate (Gy/day), exposure duration, general radiation group, vehicle (for spaceflight experiments), sample location, (for spaceflight experiments), and dosimeter type.When combined with the linked GeneLab metadata of features such as species, hardware, and radiation type, this data architecture allows the user to explore, filter, and compare the radiation environments experienced across many different types of space biology studies and even those of likely future missions. The resulting lists of GLDS datasets selected for specific characteristics of radiation exposure, then offer the possibility of further interrogating the associated omics data within GeneLab, employing either GeneLab’s visualization portal tools or other custom techniques (e.g., for plants, exploration within the TOAST database33). Such approaches allow the researcher to search for molecular fingerprints between experiments that are associated with common or different radiation exposures, and also ask how other factors within the experiment may be impacting these responses. The Rad-Bio-App should therefore help the scientific community both explore how biology responds to ionizing radiation exposure in the context of spaceflight, and also help identify space radiation conditions currently not being simulated on the ground.It is important to note here that within the data visualization portal on the GeneLab website users can search for omics datasets related to specific radiation metadata classes: radiation type, energy, dose, and dose rate. Rad-Bio-App complements these capabilities by extending the range and details of the searchable radiation metadata, and providing an interactive ability to apply quantitative filters simultaneously across all datasets. To give one example of the utility of implementing such extended capabilities: for operational reasons related to the available radiation source, there is a great deal of data from ground-based studies on a number of different organisms exposed to iron ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Fig.3). Thus, these datasets potentially provide a wealth of insight by comparing experiments with similar irradiation characteristics. A user who is expert in this area would know to search for this type of radiation exposure to aggregate this extensive set of results, a task addressable through GeneLab’s visualization portal. Using the Rad-Bio-App, a biologist relatively new to the space radiation field would quickly identify iron as a radiation type that is rich in datasets through simple exploration of the graphical representation of the aggregate terrestrial radiation data (Fig.3). Further, they could rapidly define whether their species of interest lie within these datasets. Thus, Rad-Bio-App should also help to broaden access and usage of these kinds of data23by allowing researchers who do not specialize in radiation biology to begin to incorporate potential radiation effects into their analyses and experimental designs.Fig. 3. Datasets for terrestrial experiments exposing biology to different radiation types that are deposited at GeneLab and cross-referenced within the Rad-Bio-App.Open in a new tabShown inset is the distribution of species for the Fe datasets. Mixed LEO represents the varied array of spaceflight data. Output extracted from elements of Rad-Bio-App’s graphical interface.The characteristics of the radiation data within Rad-Bio-AppSpace radiation comprises a mix of particles and energies arising from the Sun and the background galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that originates outside of the Solar System34. Therefore, Rad-Bio-App provides filtering tools to help navigate some of these intricacies. Solar particles consist of an intense flux of mostly protons and electrons with energies up to about 100 keV, but sporadic solar particle events can accelerate these particles to higher energies (about 1–10 MeV35). GCR consists of protons and heavier ions ejected from supernovae and can be even more energetic (above 100 MeV/nucleon). Nuclear or electromagnetic interactions of such primary radiation with other materials, such as the hull or shielding within a spacecraft can also lead the production of secondary particles. These secondary particles include protons, neutrons, and light charged fragments, which can themselves be highly penetrating and, as for solar particles and GCR, biologically damaging6. To help address this complexity in the spectrum of the types of radiation that may be present in an experiment, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering of the data for specific energies and doses and, for the terrestrial studies with well-defined radiation sources, by the radiation quality (e.g., alpha, Fe nucleus, proton, etc.).In relation to effects on biological systems, a further key characteristic of radiation is the energy it can deliver over a distance traveled (its Linear Energy Transfer, or LET, typically expressed in kiloelectron volts per micrometer; keV/µm). Low LET radiation is loosely defined to consist of particles with <10 keV/μm, such as protons and electrons, whereas high LET radiation is composed of energetic nuclei with greater penetrating power and consequently a greater potential to damage biological molecules36. However, even low LET radiation can still readily disrupt biological processes through effects such as DNA damage and oxidative stress37,38. Therefore, the Rad-Bio-App allows filtering on the LET of the radiation quality when known.The dose vs. dose rate challengeOne other major challenge in studying the effects of space radiation on biology is the difficulty of simulating the spectrum of space radiation conditions in the laboratory, whether on the ground or in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This issue makes it important to place the inferences a researcher can draw from Rad-Bio-App-based analyses in this context. Particle accelerator facilities on Earth, such as the NSRL, can provide low absolute doses to try to mimic expected radiation exposure in space but generally these have to be delivered in an acute manner, i.e., at dose rates on the order of Gy/min, compared to the typical rates of hundreds of µGy/day that are experienced in Space. In addition, until recently, exposures in these ground-based experiments were limited to one particle type at one energy at a time, whereas, as discussed above, space radiation represents a complex mix of radiation types. Rad-Bio-App provides filters for dose rate and particle types, when known, to help place these space radiation analog experiments in context. Fortunately, ground facilities, while still limited to relatively high dose rates, are developing more sophisticated mixed field capabilities that promise to more closely mimic the spectrum of particles eliciting space radiation effects. However, it remains a significant challenge to perform faithful space radiation-related analog experiments on the ground, and so it is critical to remember these issues when conducting Rad-Bio-App analyses.Orbiting spacecraft offer dose rates more appropriate for understanding space-related effects on biology, but again when using the Rad-Bio-App for comparisons between datasets it is important to be aware of the effects of the locale on the radiation environment. Thus, although particle types are generally not recorded for experiments conducted in spaceflight (Rad-Bio-App classes these as “Mixed” radiation), the effects of shielding from the magnetosphere means that radiation exposures in LEO will likely have a much higher proton contribution than will exploration missions traveling to the Moon and beyond. Future missions such as Artemis39, Lunar Gateway40, and BioSentinel41promise to provide data from biology operating well beyond these confounding effects of LEO. Both the GeneLab data system and Bio-Rad-App are designed to readily incorporate information from these new facilities and missions as they become available to help more faithfully align future analyses to the range of likely space radiation profiles.Architecture of the Rad-Bio-App exploration environmentRad-Bio-App is built using the Qlik database management software (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA). Radiation data have been aggregated from NASA’s GeneLab data repository21,23and data recorded by the RaD-X high-altitude balloon mission, CRaTER, the RAD, the LRD and on Apollo missions. These datasets and associated metadata were then manually curated and linked through the Qlik software engine to provide a searchable relational database (Fig.2). Qlik provides customizable interactive representations of datasets, allowing for their presentation as a simple graphical user interface built around data-centric dashboards. Data filters are incorporated allowing the user to rapidly narrow searches and comparisons by e.g., organism, radiation type, or mission and these filters then spawn to all other datasets and analysis dashboards, allowing the user to reiteratively narrow their search and comparisons across the breadth of all the data within Rad-Bio-App as described below.Navigating the Rad-Bio-App: dashboardsRad-Bio-App is navigated through an initial menu or index page that presents icons and brief descriptions linking to additional pages or dashboards, as shown in Fig.4. Each dashboard simplifies the access to a particular kind of radiation data along with the visualization and filtering tools to be able to explore those datasets.Fig. 4. Navigation within Rad-Bio-App is through dashboards accessed from a central menu page.Open in a new tabEach data exploration dashboard allows for reiterative, interactive filtering on factors such as radiation type, mission, and spaceflight hardware and allows for both dynamic visualization of the filter effects and for export of the filtered data to a spreadsheet.Dashboard #1lets the researcher find datasets by radiation exposure level. Users land on a summary of the average radiation exposure each organism experienced during an experiment indexed to the relevant dataset within the GeneLab data repository. These radiation data can be further filtered on metadata factors such as radiation type, radiation source, and exposure levels.Dashboard #2lets the user find datasets by the type of radiation from different sources. One will notice in this dashboard that a large number of datasets are classified as LEO experiments (e.g., ISS, Space Shuttle), whereas radiation data related to terrestrial experimentation allows, e.g., selecting the particle of interest (e.g., 1 GeV/n Fe). The Rad-Bio-App provides additional filtering of these datasets on features such as organism and the analytical approach used to assess biological response (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics).Dashboard #3lets the user focus on experiments conducted in space, which typically have much lower dose rates than experiments on Earth and reflect chronic exposure lasting days to weeks. As such, the dashboard lands on a graph displaying radiation doses as a function of duration. One can sub-select these spaceflight-related experiments by filtering for, e.g., mission, dosimeter, and flight hardware. It is important to note that, unlike terrestrial radiation experiments that use defined radiation sources, the precise kinds of particles responsible for the radiation exposure in most spaceflight experiments are not measured and so, as noted above, they are grouped collectively as “Mixed” radiation exposures on this dashboard. Therefore, the filter for radiation source or group in dashboard #3 is based on the region of space, where the measurement was taken (such as LEO) rather than specific radiation type as available for the terrestrial studies in the previous dashboard.Dashboard #4provides an example of a comparative analysis between maximum, minimum and average lunar orbit, lunar surface, Martian surface, and Earth-to-Mars transit radiation doses versus the wealth of spaceflight and terrestrial biological experiments available at NASA’s GeneLab data repository. The long duration of data capture for these Moon-space and Mars-space measurements means that elements such as intense solar particle events, when the Sun emits extremely high levels of radiation for a short duration, can impact on average measurements. Therefore, in addition to maximum and minimum exposures, Rad-Bio-App presents several “average” exposure rates for the lunar and Martian datasets. These averages include both values with high intensity stochastic events included and measurements drawn from periods, when these events did not occur (summarized in Supplementary Table1). For the Martian data, we also present average measurements from the RAD’s Si detector and the Si detector data corrected for radiation penetration into water. This latter measurement provides a closer analog of how the radiation is likely interacting with biology than the Si detector’s raw output. This correction relies upon a calculation from the Si detector’s measurement using a dose conversion factor, and so should be taken as an approximation5.Glossary Dashboard:Finally, the App also presents a glossary of terms on the main dashboard index page and mousing over this table reveals a full screen expansion icon, allowing the glossary to be seen on a single browser page. The homepage of the Rad-Bio-App also links to a video tutorial, which leads potential users through accessing some of the basic functions of the App.Test case: understanding radiation biology on the lunar surfaceThe Rad-Bio-App is designed to allow researchers rapid access to data on the radiation environment of a particular study and to make easy comparisons across datasets to reveal new insight. As an example, we have used Rad-Bio-App to explore possible effects of the radiation in the lunar environment. Thus, as the sights of the spaceflight community begin to widen to include crewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars, it becomes crucial to ask how radiation will affect biology under these conditions. However, to date, with the exception of the 27 Apollo astronauts who travelled to the Moon and the short duration of the seedling germination experiment in China’s Chang’E-4 mission29,30, we have no data on the functioning of biology in the lunar environment. How then to make predictions about the radiation effects to inform the future missions to this destination? Rad-Bio-App incorporates direct radiation measurements made by CRaTER as it orbits the Moon, from the Chang’E-4 lander on the lunar surface and aggregate data from astronaut dosimetry on the Apollo missions. Thus, Rad-Bio-App allows filtering the array of LEO spaceflight and terrestrial data from NASA’s Genelab repository for radiation exposures lying close those expected for the lunar environs. An example of this kind of analysis is shown in Figs.5and6, using Dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App. For this analysis, we explored the lunar surface environment and so used the direct measurements of lunar surface radiation made by Chang’E 4 to ask, if there were datasets within the GeneLab data repository that might help inform on how biology would act under these radiation conditions. Briefly, we took the average mixed lunar surface radiation dose rate from the LRD detector on Chang’E-4 (0.55 mGy/day) and set limits of 2x − 0.5x (i.e., searching for <1.1 to >0.25 mGy/day—see Fig.5step 2), assuming it would broadly cover a likely lunar radiation dose rate. This approach identified 32 experiments (Fig.5, step 3), generating a table at the bottom of the dashboard which we downloaded by clicking on the download icon (down green arrow in Fig.5, step 4). Rad-Bio-App further showed that the corresponding datasets span ten different organisms. Here, we capitalized on the synergy possible between the well-curated data repository at GeneLab and the rapid dataset surveys possible through Rad-Bio-App. Thus, interrogating the GeneLab data repository revealed gene expression analysis was performed on flight samples versus a paired ground control in most of the studies identified in the above analysis. Rad-Bio-App also readily showed that the majority (15) of these studies were from mice, with analyses of whole genome gene expression performed using either microarray or RNAseq technologies. In addition, cross-referencing to the GeneLab visualization portal revealed that most of these datasets have been processed through GeneLab’s uniform microarray or RNAseq software pipelines (Overbey et al.42). That is, these datasets have been pre-processed within the GeneLab data system using the same computational approaches, and the analyzed results on differential gene expression deposited and made publicly available for download.Fig. 5. Example of use of Rad-Bio-App to define datasets within the GeneLab data repository mimicking a lunar surface exposure.Open in a new tabThe data within dashboard #4 of the Rad-Bio-App contains radiation data from Martian, lunar and spaceflight missions and ground-based radiation experiments. These data were filtered using radiation levels recorded on the lunar surface by the Chang’e 4 lander, with limits set to span a 2-fold range around the average dose rate (0.55 mGy/d). Results of this filtering were then exported to build a listing of spaceflight experiment datasets within the GeneLab data repository where their radiation exposure lies within this range of dose rates. Green numbers in table, datasets pre-processed by either the GeneLab uniform microarray or RNAseq analysis pipelines.Fig. 6. Analysis of radiation responsive mouse genes showing altered expression in spaceflight.Open in a new tabaLog2-fold change of differentially expressed genes (flight vs ground or flight vs. basal) from mouse RNAseq datasets identified from Fig.5(GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, 248) were cross-referenced to genes annotated as being radiation responsive in the RadAtlas database50.bOntology enrichment analysis performed using Metascape51. Ground control is sample harvested synchronously with flight samples, basal control are samples harvested immediately prior to flight.Briefly, for these analytical pipelines, the GeneLab analyses were implemented in the Galaxy software environment43, with the microarray analysis using the R/Bioconductor software package Limma44and RNA-seq using STAR (v2.7.1a45) and RSEM (v1.3.146). Further descriptions of the processing and links to the analytical codes used, along with the deposited analyzed datasets are available on the Genelab website22. Application of the same analytical steps for each dataset allows for much more robust comparisons between studies, and the free access to the deposited results greatly speeds and simplifies subsequent exploration.These analyses then provided us with target datasets within the GeneLab data repository to explore for common molecular signatures from biology experiencing radiation dose rates similar to what we might predict on future missions to the Moon. One must note here that comparing microarray and RNAseq datasets can be complex to perform and interpret due to potential artifacts generated by mixing results from these different analytical technologies (e.g., ref.47). Therefore, to increase the robustness of our further analyses, we focused on five RNAseq datasets derived from the same mission: Rodent Research 6 (RR6)48. These RR6 datasets were from five different tissues: dorsal skin, thymus, spleen, colon, and lung, respectively (i.e., GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, and 248) and they were processed using the GeneLab RNAseq pipeline42. These datasets had multiple controls: tissues were either collected from sacrificed animals and then preserved (i.e., euthanasia), versus where the whole animal was first frozen (to be dissected later by thawing) at the same time as carcasses preserved in space by astronauts (i.e., carcass). Another factor differentiating various controls were animals sacrificed just before the mission (i.e., basal control) versus animals sacrificed on the ground at the same time as in space (i.e., ground control—GC). Such experimental factors were recently described in detail and their impact on gene expression discussed49. These five different tissues provided ten flight-to-basal-control and five flight-to-GC comparisons within the pre-processed datasets deposited at GeneLab, and so we downloaded the gene expression data for these 15 comparisons from the GeneLab data repository for further analysis.We next interrogated the RadAtlas50, a tool that provides an aggregation of gene expression profiles of radiation-associated and radiation-responsive genes drawn from the ground-based literature. We downloaded the aggregated data from the RadAtlas and asked, which of the genes identified as transcriptionally responsive to radiation in that tool also showed transcriptional changes in the mouse spaceflight RNAseq datasets described above (Supplementary Data1). We then filtered this list to ask, of these genes, which of them showed agreement in either induction or repression in spaceflight to greater than 2-fold in at least four of the mouse datasets. To increase the rigor of this filtering, we set the further criterion that no dataset showed a conflicting response. i.e., if four or more datasets showed induction of a particular gene, none of the other datasets also showed repression at the 2-fold cutoff (Fig.6aand Supplementary Data1). This thresholding allowed us to identify putative shared radiation response genes whilst filtering out those showing small or inconsistent responses. We then used the gene network annotation and analysis tool Metascape51to visualize the functional groupings (ontologies) associated with these sets of genes (Fig.6b). This list showed enrichment in features ranging from T-cell apoptosis, to DNA repair and the regulation of the cell cycle, providing targets for future exploration of possible radiation effects in the spaceflight environment through e.g., targeted flight experimentation."

        "Title": "The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 participates in submergence and anoxia stress responses.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (\nOryza sativa\n) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional\nca\ntion/proton e\nx\nchangers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that\ncax1\nmutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified\ncax1\n-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and\ncax1\nexpressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in\ncax1\nduring reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that\ncax1\nanoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants are frequently exposed to limited oxygen availability, influencing plant growth and, in an agricultural context, plant productivity (Loreti et al., 2016;Pedersen et al., 2017;Schmidt et al., 2018). The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (Rawyler et al., 2002). To survive and limit post-anoxic injuries, plants often regulate the flow of the little energy produced under stress conditions to essential processes (Blokhina et al., 2001;Virolainen et al., 2002;Huang et al., 2008;Atwell et al., 2015). In a natural context, submergence leads to multiple abiotic stress-related constraints, including limited light availability and the occurrence of oxidative stress either during or after the period of hypoxic conditions (Sasidharan et al., 2018). Plants respond to submergence by responding to ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues because of the lower underwater gas diffusion rate. The perception and response to cellular oxygen (O2) levels per se is mediated by a subset of ethylene response factors (ERFs) belonging to the group VII of this large class of transcription factors (ERF-VII;Gibbs et al., 2015). ERF-VIIs induce a set of genes which are required to adapt plant metabolism and growth during low O2conditions (Paul et al., 2016). Calcium (Ca) signaling is another, less studied, component of plant responses to hypoxia (Igamberdiev and Hill, 2018;Huang et al., 2022). Ca signaling was proposed to control the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) and this would imply a cross-talk of this signaling pathway with the ERF-VII-dependent regulation of HRGs (Subbaiah et al., 1994), although this is not yet been demonstrated. In response to changes in O2levels, Ca signaling differs among plants, with marked differences between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) in the spatiotemporal parameters of the observed Ca signatures (Bailey-Serres and Chang, 2005;Behera et al., 2015). Ca signaling differences appear to precede gene expression differences and metabolic fluxes, although precisely how Ca is triggering downstream events remains unclear (Schmidt et al., 2018). Conceptualizing signaling events involved in anoxia perception and tolerance might be useful to improve plant performance both during and after anoxic conditions.Ca is at the nexus between many facets of plant biology (Ali et al., 2007;Ma and Berkowitz, 2007;Choi et al., 2017;Costa et al., 2018;Demidchik et al., 2018). Ca transporters on various membranes help to orchestrate responses to stresses such as changes in temperature and anoxia (Catalá et al., 2003;Wang et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2017;Costa et al., 2018;Weigand et al., 2021). Ca pumps and exchangers are found in multiple membrane systems, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuole, and plasma membrane (PM;Blumwald and Poole, 1986). Ca pumps are considered low-capacity, high-affinity efflux systems, but within this broad group of transporters, H+/CaeXchangers (CAXs) are distinct because they have high capacity and low affinity (Kong et al., 2020;Tian et al., 2020). While both Ca pumps and CAXs remove Ca from the cytoplasm, their individual contributions to the control of the magnitude or duration of different stimulus-specific Ca signals remains enigmatic.There are six CAXs in Arabidopsis, but onlyCAX1–4are expressed and appear to be predominately localized to the vacuole (Manohar et al., 2011).CAX2andCAX4are expressed at lower levels in plants, and most of the research on Ca signaling and homeostasis in plants has focused on the more highly expressedCAX1andCAX3(29).CAX1is expressed in aerial tissue and is the dominant mechanism for Ca accumulation in the leaf (Conn et al., 2011;Whitt et al., 2020);CAX3is primarily expressed in the roots (Hocking et al., 2017). The absence ofCAX1induces ectopic expression of otherCAXs, which is often sufficient to maintain mesophyll cellular uptake of Ca from the apoplast (Cheng et al., 2005). The numerouscax1lines characterized have subtle phenotypes throughout their life cycle and are virtually indistinguishable from controls in normal growth conditions (Manohar et al., 2011). These subtle phenotypes could be due to the interplay between CAX transporters and other transporters; deletions inCAX1reduce vacuolar H+/Ca antiport activity by 50%, decrease vacuolar V-type proton ATPase activity by 40% and increase vacuolar Ca-ATPase activity by 36% (Cheng et al., 2003).Plant responses to hypoxia and anoxia have been extensively studied (Atwell et al., 2015;Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2013;Voesenek et al., 2016); however, less is known about the contribution of Ca signaling processes governing a plant’s tolerance to low oxygen. Traditional approaches to study these events include differential gene expression studies and comparative genomic analysis (Yeung et al., 2018). Here, our analysis focuses onCAX1, a gene that is neither highly expressed during oxygen stress conditions nor thought to be modified in plants adapted to oxygen limitations. We demonstrate thatcax1plants are extremely tolerant to anoxia conditions and submergence. We established that during post anoxia,cax1showed reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealedcax1plants displayed apparent changes in transcripts and proteins for Ca transport and numerous signaling pathways. We also investigated howcax1changed the amplitude and duration of Ca signals during reoxygenation. Our work highlights a central role of tonoplast localized H+/Ca2+transport in anoxia responses while further defining the molecular choreography of anoxia signaling."

        "Title": "Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15\nArabidopsis thaliana\nspaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs.\nSubject terms:\nPlant sciences, Genetic databases",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight imposes a unique suite of environmental effects on biology. For example, microgravity severely curtails the signals normally generated on Earth from the intrinsic weight of a plant’s organs1and by its gravity perceptive cells2–4. By contrast, in the terrestrial environment, these are key factors driving normal growth and development. In addition, gravitational forces on Earth govern a host of physical processes including gas and liquid flow that are important for normal plant function. Thus, the microgravity environment can lead to the development of anoxic regions around metabolically active plant tissues and altered patterns of evaporative and convective cooling that can impact leaf function and physiology5–8. Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9.One way to probe the responses of organisms to spaceflight is by analysis of changes in their transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, genomes and epigenomes induced by exposure to this environment. In the field of plant biology the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab data repository10,11has aggregated many such omics datasets. Critically, the deposited data are associated with extensive metadata covering elements of each experiment’s design ranging from features of the hardware, radiation exposure and lighting regime to treatment duration, genotype and organism age. Such extensive and accurate metadata are critical to understanding the breadth of differences in experimental designs when making comparisons between studies. This insight is important as the flight hardware used, the analysis methodology employed (e.g., microarray versus RNA-seq for transcriptome studies) and other experimental parameters likely superimpose their own, often poorly defined, influences on the results (so-called batch effects12). Indeed, recent analysis of rodent spaceflight data suggests differences in sample preservation eclipsed spaceflight-driven differences in mouse transcriptional profiling13. However, given the relatively few opportunities to conduct experiments in space, making comparisons between existing studies represents a potentially powerful approach to identify common responses in the often-limited available spaceflight data.We have therefore imported 15 spaceflight-related plant transcriptome datasets from the GeneLab data repository and manually curated the associated metadata to develop a metadata matrix (hereafter, the Matrix). This approach allows the more robust design of comparisons between studies that share commonalities in experimental design. Our meta-analyses broadly confirmed the spaceflight-related changes in cell wall processes and oxidative stress that were highlighted in many of the original publications associated with each individual study. Additionally, Matrix-driven analyses helped reveal new response elements, such as conserved spaceflight-triggered changes in expression of the cold response geneCOLD RESPONSIVE 78(COR78), and likely shifts in ion transport processes. We also identified factors within the experimental design such as choice of flight hardware and especially assay technique (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) that can impose greater differences between datasets than the spaceflight treatment. Thus, the Matrix allows researchers to explore the wealth of plant biology transcriptomic data generated during spaceflight-related studies and provides an approach to better understand underlying factors impacting the robustness of comparisons made between the different datasets."

        "Title": "Low-dose, ionizing radiation and age-related changes in skeletal microarchitecture",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOsteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy\n137\nCs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months).\nEx vivo\nbone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionOsteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently affecting an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estrogen deficiency is primarily responsible for the rapid postmenopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility (type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or senile osteoporosis) affects both men and women late in life [1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively declines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the surrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of bone affected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and the spongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity; the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundly affected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in cancellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone to fracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structure occurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL/6J mice provide a well-established animal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancellous tissue [3,4], characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans.Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively differentiate from progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells culturedex vivoretain behavioral characteristics ofin vivofunction; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast differentiation (osteoblastogenesis) or osteoclast differentiation (osteoclastogenesis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposure to radiation [5–8].Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) both by the ionization of target molecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, also implicated in the development of osteoporosis [9–12]. The production of ROS/RNS causes oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and protein influencing key cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays, X-rays) at high cumulative doses (>200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cortical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility [13], while adverse effects of lower doses (100–200 cGy) appear to be confined to cancellous tissue in animal models [12,14–16]. Much less is known about how low doses influence skeletal health.Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive loss of microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structural changes in cancellous tissue within one month that occurred over 4 months in controls, with no further decrements following 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell populations to differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaffected."

        "Title": "Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (\n137\nCs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (\n56\nFe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (\nRankl\n), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly,\nRankl\nexpression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in\nRankl\nexpression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio,\nRankl/Opg\n, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor,\nNfe2l2\n, strongly correlated with expression levels of\nNfatc1\n,\nCsf1\n,\nTnf\n, and\nRankl\n. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionDuring a spaceflight beyondthe Earth's protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation. Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses (≤2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others1999; Parsons and Townsend2000) or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others2013; Hassler and others2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total volume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others2009; Willey and others2010). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast numbers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others2006; Alwood and others2010; Kondo and others2010; Willey and others2010; Yumoto and others2010; Lloyd and others2012). Doses in the range of 1–2 Gy also are relevant to radiotherapy; total therapeutic doses can vary, but total body doses of 10–15 Gy typically are fractionated into single doses of ∼2 Gy, which ultimately can lead to increased fracture incidence (Baxter and others2005). Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious effects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight (LeBlanc and others2000; Lang and others2004,2006; Keyak and others2009; Alwood and others2010; Yumoto and others2010).Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a transient (<2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tissue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time of radiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others2010; Willey and others2010; Alwood and others2012). Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others2009; Willey and others2010; Turner and others2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural integrity (Alwood and others2010). Radiation exposure transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteoclasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by osteoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), the principal osteoclastogenic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inflammatory cytokines (Kim and others2006; Takayanagi2007; Boyce and Xing2008) and oxidative stress is not fully understood with respect to the cancellous bone loss following radiation exposure (Kondo and others2009).Total body irradiation (≤2 Gy) causes time-dependent changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in bone mass observed following exposure to total body irradiation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others2010). Although radiation does affect osteoblast function within the first week of exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone formation rate (Kondo and others2010). Similarly, Willey and others (2010) also report increased MAR within the first week after exposure, but subsequently BFR/BS declines by 2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-induced changes in bone formation are more likely to contribute to later remodeling deficits rather than acute bone loss.To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expression within both marrow and mineralized tissue ofRankland select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various models of inflammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett2012) following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2,Nfe2l2), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto2005) and is known to play a role in dampening osteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others2013).We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces expression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inflammatory, and antioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissue compartments and increases markers of bone resorption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows an acute and time-dependent elevation ofRankl, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. These molecular changes precede (<3 days) the manifestation of bone loss (3–7 days) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions."

        "Title": "Preservation of Multiple Mammalian Tissues to Maximize Science Return from Ground Based and Spaceflight Experiments",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nEven with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved.\nObjectives\nThe goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage\nin situ\nat -80°C.\nMethods\nTissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH).\nResults\nFresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months.\nConclusion\nThese results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue\nin situ\nat -80°C. These findings have relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionChallenges continue to exist in regards to acquiring high quality samples from animal tissues despite recent technical advances. From the time spent collecting the samples to the use of stabilizing or preserving agents, and ultimately to the storage conditions and duration prior to actual analysis, each step is critical and requires attention. Timing plays a key role in obtaining high quality samples. Ideally, samples are harvested immediately post-euthanasia by trained and experienced staff, and the time between death and sample stabilization is minimized to limit sample degradation. If the samples are not analyzed at the time of euthanasia, then additional factors that may affect sample quality are of concern, including freezing rate and duration of storage. Understanding these challenges faced in the laboratory aids the researcher to optimize protocols to maximize sample quality and accomplish science objectives; translating those practices for use in the space environment, however, raises new challenges.Several factors potentially affect sample quality, and ultimately, the downstream experimental results. The procedure to obtain high quality RNA varies between different laboratories [1]. The most reliable source for obtaining high quality RNA is by purification from freshly dissected tissues [2–7]. A factor to be taken into consideration when tissues are not processed immediately at the time of harvesting is the time samples are exposed to periods of warm ischemia, which may occur during and after surgery, and between sample thawing and processing. In some instances, warm ischemia-induced degradation alters gene expression profiles and RNA quality in certain tissues, although the process appears to have selective effects on individual genes [4,8,9].RNA is subject to degradation by ubiquitous RNAses, and high quality RNA is needed for analysis of gene expression, next-generation sequencing, gene profiling and other “Omics” analyses in the study of molecular mechanisms. The addition of an RNA stabilization solution to tissues, either by immersion or perfusion, has become standard practice for RNA stabilization [7,10,11]. Studies where select tissues are frozen immediately upon harvesting, with or without stabilization buffer, show no significant detriment to the quality of the RNA [6,12–16]. Frozen tissues that are allowed to thaw at room temperature up to 16 hours show significant degradation in samples without a stabilization buffer such as RNAlater, versus those stored in RNAlater [14]. Recent work published by Gupta et al describe retention of RNA quality in rodent male and female reproductive organs when samples are placed into RNAlater up to 40 minutes after euthanasia and in RNAlater treated samples stored at -80°C for 10 months [17]. Other studies reveal severe degradation of RNA in frozen tissues when allowed to thaw for up to 30 minutes prior to analysis, suggesting the necessity for immediate processing of certain tissues [18,19].In the studies reported here, we investigated various time points and storage conditions for retrieving tissues from mice, and then determined the impact that these conditions had on sample quality. By measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and enzyme activities in tissues under various recovery scenarios, we have characterized and established an acceptable timeline for rodent tissue isolation, preservation, and storage to optimize science return from both ground based and on-orbit flight sample collection."

        "Title": "Hindlimb Unloading: Rodent Analog for Microgravity",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nProlonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats.\nMethods\nFirstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading.\nResults\nClustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions.\nConclusions\nThis study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionWith the increasing frequency of long-duration spaceflights, astronauts are confronted with a myriad of harsh conditions, including radiation, microgravity and circadian rhythm disruptions. These factors precipitate a cascade of cardiovascular changes, initially characterized by fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head. Subsequent phenomena include decreased circulatory blood volume, diminished diastolic arterial pressure, reduced left ventricular dimensions, and post-flight orthostatic intolerance. Furthermore, there is evidence of accelerated physiological aging in the CA, which appears to be reversible [1]. The structural and functional vascular deconditioning observed in spaceflight has been attributed to alterations in the arterial wall. Studies have documented increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA following 6 months of spaceflight, along with increased intima-media thickness in both CA and FA [2]. Several molecular regulators such as osteopontin [3], nuclear factor kappa B [4], and acid sphingomyelinase [5], have been implicated in the regional-specific arterial remodeling induced by weightlessness. However, a systematic genetic and molecular explanation for these vascular changes remains elusive.The vascular tissue is made up of several types of cells such as ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages, which exhibit different responsiveness to simulated microgravity. Traditional molecular biology techniques have struggled to discern the differential cellular responses to weightless environments, despite previous transcriptomic analyses of the vasculature under microgravity. While ECs and SMCs have been the focus of much research, the roles of fibroblasts and macrophages in vascular remodeling under simulated microgravity have not been well-defined. The advent of scRNA-seq has enabled the exploration of transcriptional heterogeneity across various vascular cell types. In this study, we conducted scRNA-seq on CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of tail suspension and compared them to age-matched controls under normal gravity conditions. This approach aimed to elucidate artery-specific and cell type-specific molecular signatures, identify key cell sub-clusters, assess intercellular communication networks, and identify important transcription factors. Our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the structural and functional vascular changes observed in space."

        "Title": "Influence of social isolation during prolonged simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4\n+\nT cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.\nKeywords:\nhindlimb unloading, microgravity model, bone loss, muscle atrophy, immune system, spaceflight, social isolation, HPA axis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe spaceflight environment poses significant challenges to multiple organ systems. Microgravity exposure leads to a cephalad fluid shift (Foux et al., 1976;Thornton et al., 1987) as well as osteopenia (Lang et al., 2004) and sarcopenia (LeBlanc et al., 2000). Spaceflight alters electrolyte balance (Vorobiev et al., 1995) as well as endocrine (Stowe et al., 2003,2011), vision (Zhang and Hargens, 2018) and baroreflex processes (Fritsch et al., 1992;Buckey et al., 1996;Meck et al., 2001). Cardiovascular changes include stiffening of the carotid arteries as seen in astronauts returning from a 6-month ISS mission (Hughson et al., 2016) and transient changes in heart rate variability (Yamamoto et al., 2015). Spaceflight also may lead to CNS changes including a decline in cognitive performance (Eddy et al., 1998). Immune system dysregulation also occurs, characterized by altered immune cell function and reactivation of viruses (Crucian et al., 2015,2018;Mehta et al., 2017). These findings from astronauts are the main motivation to study rodents flown into space with the rationale that rodents are used extensively to model human conditions on Earth and may prove useful for understanding mechanisms and anticipating human responses to spaceflight. However, limited opportunities for rodent spaceflight studies, along with other challenges of conducting microgravity experiments, stimulated interest in using ground-based rodent models of weightlessness.The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model was developed initially to simulate the responses of the musculoskeletal system to microgravity (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987;Morey-Holton et al., 2005;Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). To date, its use has expanded to study the responses of other organ systems to spaceflight, including immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). The HU model also is utilized to study disorders on Earth such as osteopenia and sarcopenia because features of the HU model mimic bedrest and disuse. Initial efforts to generate a rodent model for musculoskeletal unloading entailed use of a back harness for inducing a cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse of the hindlimbs in singly housed animals (Morey, 1979), which was then developed further to introduce tail suspension which improved outcomes (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987). This system employs non-invasive attachment of the tail via orthopedic traction tape onto a pulley system that allows for elevation of the hindlimbs; application with the custom-designed cage enables free movement of the animal about the cage (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002;Morey-Holton et al., 2005). Since then, other variants of the HU system emerged and include partial unloading of all four limbs using a custom body harness (Wagner et al., 2010;Ellman et al., 2013;Mortreux et al., 2018), various methods to induce unloading such as surgical piercing of the tail, alternative taping methods, simplified cage systems that restrict movement, and group housing (Ferreira et al., 2011;Maurel et al., 2016).Single versus social housing of rodents under standard, ambulatory conditions, can differentially impact multiple organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous system) known also to be affected by spaceflight (Beisel and Talbot, 1987;Schmitt and Schaffar, 1993;D’Aunno et al., 2003;Migeotte et al., 2003;Pierson et al., 2005;Hughson et al., 2016;Mehta et al., 2017). Social isolation causes anxiety and depressive-like behavior (Djordjevic et al., 2012), disrupted circadian rhythms (Spani et al., 2003), deficits in memory (McLean et al., 2010), activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and impairments in antioxidant responses in the brain (Djordjevic et al., 2015). Social isolation also can stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Jessop and Bayer, 1989;Ros-Simo and Valverde, 2012;Shetty and Sadananda, 2017), the main neuroendocrine regulator of mammalian stress responses (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014). However, other studies report that social isolation can lead to decrements in circulating corticosterone levels (Djordjevic et al., 2012;Ieraci et al., 2016) although it is not clear whether these reflect an initial downregulation of HPA axis activation or simply the induction of a negative feedback loop after a state of activation. In addition, social isolation in rodents leads to impairments in immune function (Jessop and Bayer, 1989;Clausing et al., 1994;Shanks et al., 1994;Wu et al., 2000;Krugel et al., 2014).Social isolation can be a confounding factor for interpreting experimental outcomes from both rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. In rats, 9 days of spaceflight reduced periosteal bone formation and bone mass (femur dry weights) in singly housed animals but had minimal effect on bone formation or mass in group housed animals (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). In an interesting study,Tsvirkun et al. (2012)report that HU (in standard, single housing) or social isolation (without unloading) each can perturb blood pressure and heart rate levels.The possible contribution of social isolation to the biological outcomes of HU has not been studied, leaving a number of knowledge gaps in our understanding of the model for simulating weightlessness. It is unclear whether social interactions (social versus single housing) during HU differentially impacts organ systems known to be responsive to HU. Rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), particularly those making use of the NASA Rodent Research habitat, are conducted in group housed conditions whereas most HU studies conducted to date entail use of the standard, single housed HU model. Other groups have developed variants of the HU model that accommodate social housing in pairs (Ferreira et al., 2011;Lloyd et al., 2012;Maurel et al., 2016). However, characterization of these models in side-by-side studies with the traditional singly housed HU model have not been conducted. Hence, there is value to further developing and characterizing the socially housed HU model for simulating weightlessness to better match rodent habitat conditions on the ISS. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will lead to an improved understanding of the contribution of isolation to observed responses to HU, which in turn will improve the ability to extrapolate HU results to humans in space.To address these knowledge gaps, we aimed to (1) develop a refinement to the NASA Ames HU system, which traditionally entails housing mice in isolation (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002;Morey-Holton et al., 2005) to enable housing in social pairs and (2) determine the contribution of social isolation to the HU responses of various tissues. We hypothesized that relative to social housing, single housing exacerbates HU-induced dysfunction in select organ systems. To meet these aims and test the hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side comparison of this alternative social HU system versus the standard NASA Ames single housed design and evaluated the responses of select spaceflight-relevant tissues to HU."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAnimal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen\nin situ\nfor later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.\nSubject terms:\nMicroarray analysis, Ageing, Homeostasis, Translational research",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace travel over the past five decades reveals that multiple organ systems are influenced by novel environmental conditions above the Earth’s surface. In addition to reduced gravitational acceleration, spaceflight confers other unique environmental challenges including confinement in a closed environment, altered gas composition and exposure to space radiation, each of which has the potential to have physiological effects. Protecting humans in space requires a clear understanding of the myriad of physiologic changes that can occur in response to these exposures and their associated medical risks. As on Earth, experimentation with rodents in space enables detailed exploration of physiology and mechanisms, as well as potential mitigation strategies using experimental approaches that are not possible with humans as subjects. All but two spaceflight rodent experiments, prior to the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission described here, have entailed sample collection only after return to Earth. In fact, some of the observed consequences of spaceflight on tissue structure1and gene expression2can be attributed to forces related to return and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery, rather than to habitation in space per se. Therefore, there is a pressing need for spaceflight hardware and operational systems to further explore the consequences of long duration space travel on rodents, while avoiding the confounding variables introduced by reentry and return of the animals to Earth.Previous Russian Cosmos and NASA Space Shuttle missions provided multiple opportunities to perform rodent experiments up to three weeks in duration, which contributed to our current understanding of how mammals adapt to the space environment. Rodent Space Shuttle experiments conducted between 1965 and 2011 demonstrated extensive changes in the immune, musculoskeletal, and central nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as endocrine, hematologic and metabolic changes3, although results between missions were sometimes inconsistent. Various independent variables such as strain, age, and duration may account for at least some of the mixed results obtained between different experiments; however, the relatively short duration of all Shuttle missions is likely to be a major factor explaining the discrepancies. Tissues adapt dynamically and at different rates to the allostatic load imposed in the course of a prolonged spaceflight experiment, which entails introduction into a novel flight hardware caging environment, launch, habitation in microgravity, then typically reentry and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery.There also have been a limited number of long duration (>3 wk), rodent spaceflight experiments. A recent unmanned, Russian biosatellite experiment (Bion M1) that entailed sample recovery after return to Earth revealed that 30 days of spaceflight caused muscle, thymus and spleen atrophy (4,5deficits in structure of various skeletal elements (6,7), altered structural morphology and changes in gene expression of several tissues5,8. The lengthy interval (13 hr) between capsule reentry and sample recovery for the Bion M1 mission may have affected at least some of these findings. The longest duration experiment with rodents in space completed to date (91d) in the European Space Agency’s Mouse Drawer System9revealed intriguing differences in oxidative damage to red blood cells10and skeletal decrements11, although this experiment had a limited sample size. Recently, the Japanese Space Agency performed important experiments with a newly developed flight hardware system supporting singly-housed mice, which can be centrifuged at 1 g to replace Earth’s gravity level while on the ISS12. Findings from their experiments reveal that 1 g artificial gravity mitigates the expected bone loss and muscle atrophy12as well as retinal changes13that occur after long duration microgravity. Each of the various flight hardware systems developed for long duration spaceflight has unique features, which have the potential to influence results obtained (Table1).Table 1.Rodent hardware utilized by space agencies.Space AgencyHardwareMaximum # of mice per chamberCamerasunique featuresReferenceJapanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)MHU (Mouse Habitat Unit)12 cages per unit; each cage accommodates 1 mouseYescentrifuge compatible, smooth walls to limit ambulation, temperature sensor, crew can access animals on orbit12,58–62Italian Space AgencyMDS (Mouse Drawer System)6 individually (max) or in groups (4 pairs)Yestemperature, humidity, CO2and NH3control system, smooth walls to limit ambulation, crew can access animals on orbit9,63–65Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russian Academy of SciencesBion-M1 Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS)3Yestemperature, humidity, CO2and O2controlled system, smooth walls to limit ambulation17,66,67National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)AEM (Animal Enclosure Module)up to 10 mice or 5 ratsNono sensors for temperature and humidity, metal grid walls, layered filter system, interior lighting, crew can access animals on orbit68,69NASARodent Habitatup to 10 mice (5 per side); 5–6 ratsYesmetal grid walls, temperature and humidity sensors, long duration filter for improved odor containment, LED lighting (day), infrared lighting (night), crew can access animals on orbit14,18–24Open in a new tabA brief description of rodent hardware, and its features and capabilities, utilized by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, Italian Space Agency, Institute of Biomedical Problems/Russian Academy of Sciences, and NASA.The main goal of RR-1 was to establish new capabilities for conducting reliable and reproducible long duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Important objectives included monitoring animal health and welfare, and recovering samples of sufficiently high quality for global gene expression analysis using current demanding methods. The RR-1 flight experiment consisted of two separate studies with a total of 20 mice; one NASA Validation study (10 mice) and one ISS National Lab Experimental study (10 mice). The NASA Validation study was designed to evaluate the capaibilities of the rodent hardware, on-orbit operations, and sample retrieval for conducting high quality rodent expeirments consistent with current standards. The Experimental study was sponsored by the ISS National Lab on behalf of Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, and was designed to determine spaceflight effects on muscle atrophy in MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice14–16. Results from both studies contributed to the findings described in this paper.The Rodent Habitat differs from other long duration spaceflight housing systems12,17in that it provides for both group-housing and internal wire grating that enable grabbing and purposeful locomotion throughout the cage, much like human crew do throughout the cabin. To accommodate unique aspects of the Dragon transport vehicle and the ISS, flight hardware was modified from the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), that was used successfully in 27 missions with rats or mice aboard the Space Shuttle3followed by multiple RR missions14,18–25.The RR-1 validation mission launched adult, female mice to low earth orbit in an unmanned Dragon capsule on SpaceX-4, then after 4 days the RR-1 mice were transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) where they resided for up to 33 days (total 37 days in microgravity). Female mice were selected for this mission for two reasons: first, because only female mice were flown on earlier missions that used the heritage AEM group-housed hardware system, and second, to avoid potential complications due to aggression which is more common in males than females. After this first Validation mission, pre-flight experiments were performed to optimize conditions for acclimating males in group-housed conditions22, and subsequently flight experiments were conducted successfully with males19.Important aspects of the study design included use of adult animals, a cage system that enabled purposeful locomotion of the animals throughout the habitat, and measurements of basic indices of animal health that were compromised in past spaceflight experiments. Animal health and behavior were monitored by daily downlinked video, and samples were dissected both on-orbit by astronauts and after return to Earth from frozen carcasses. Subsequently, tissue samples were distributed to multiple scientists across the world for detailed analyses. We found mice thrived in the housing, as assessed by behavior, body weights and organ mass (adrenal, thymus, spleen). Further, samples dissected on-orbit yielded high quality RNA and protein (select liver enzyme activities). Recovery of livers dissected from frozen carcasses yielded RNA with high RIN values, although further work is needed to determine conclusively if transcriptional profiles are the same in livers freshly dissected on orbit compared to livers recovered post-flight from frozen carcasses."

        "Title": "Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H\n2\nO\n2\naccumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe molecular mechanisms that govern the imbalance between pathways controlling protein synthesis and degradation in disuse muscle atrophy remain unclear, notwithstanding the large amount of work done (Bonaldo & Sandri,2013). Investigations of multiple models of disuse in animals have shown an up-regulation of genes related to protein degradation and stress response as well as a down-regulation of those related to transcription and translation, and energy metabolism (Leckeret al.2004; Bodine,2013).Debate is ongoing regarding whether and to what extent redox signalling can actually be the trigger of such phenomena (Pellegrinoet al. 2011a,b; Powerset al.2012). A growing body of evidence challenges oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy (Ikemotoet al.2002; Koestereret al.2002; Servaiset al.2007; Broccaet al.2010; Desaphyet al.2010; Gloveret al.2010; Kuwaharaet al.2010; Pellegrinoet al. 2011b; Powerset al.2012; Cannavinoet al.2014). We have recently reported that, in soleus muscle, notwithstanding an early persistent redox imbalance, a metabolic programme controlling muscle mass, rather than oxidative stress, played a major role in triggering hindlimb unloading (HU) muscle atrophy. A down-regulation of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression and protein content was, in fact, shown to activate catabolic systems by promoting ubiquitin ligase and autophagy gene expression through FoxO3 disinhibition (Cannavinoet al.2014).Although most studies on mice have focused on the anti-gravitary, slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a significant loss of mass following unloading (Kyparoset al.2005; Broccaet al.2010; Desaphyet al.2010). As fast muscles in mice have mostly a glycolytic metabolism and express low levels of PGC-1 (Linet al.2002), the metabolic programme supporting disuse-induced muscle mass loss in soleus might not be relevant in fast muscles.Data regarding PGC-1α during disuse in fast muscles are inconsistent: increases (Wagatsumaet al.2011), decreases (Mazzattiet al.2008) as well as no change (Nagatomoet al.2011) of PGC-1α levels have been reported. However, alterations of mitochondrial biogenesis (Liuet al. 2012b), mitochondrial respiration (Yajidet al.1998) and mitochondrial dynamics (Wagatsumaet al.2011; Liuet al. 2012b) have been shown after prolonged unloading in fast muscles. Moreover, in our previous study we demonstrated that antioxidant treatment during unloading did not prevent gastrocnemius atrophy, suggesting that oxidative stress is not the major cause of disuse atrophy also in fast muscle (Broccaet al.2010).A recent report has highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in cell and animal physiology. Mitochondria constantly fuse and divide, and an imbalance of these two processes dramatically alters overall mitochondrial morphology and function (Chen & Chan,2005). Mitochondrial fusion and fission have emerged as important processes that govern mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan,2007; Hoppinset al.2007). The mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, are located on the mitochondrial outer membrane and are involved in early steps in membrane fusion (Koshibaet al.2004; Meeusenet al.2006; Songet al.2009). The dynamin-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is associated with the inner membrane and is essential for inner membrane fusion (Meeusenet al.2006; Songet al.2009). In addition to its well-recognized function of controlling mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial fusion clearly protects mitochondrial function (Detmer & Chan,2007). Mice lacking Mfn1/2 function in skeletal muscle exhibit both mitochondrial dysfunction and profound muscle atrophy (Chenet al.2010).Mfn2 is a key target of the nuclear coactivator PGC-1α. Maintenance of a normal expression of Mfn2 is critical for the stimulatory effect of PGC-1α on mitochondrial membrane potential (Sorianoet al.2006) and PGC-1α may regulate mitochondrial fusion/fission events and hence mitochondrial function (Sorianoet al.2006). The latter phenomena could reduce ATP generating capacity, which in turn could shift signalling pathways toward catabolism through activation of 5’AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK, a cellular kinase, senses the energy level of the cell and causes atrogin-1 and muscle-specific ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) induction via a FoxO3-dependent mechanism (Tonget al.2009) determining muscle loss.The goal of the present study was to clarify whether mytochondrial dysfunction, recently indicated to play a major role in soleus (Cannavinoet al.2014), could trigger disuse-induced muscle atrophy also in a fast muscle, the gastrocnemius, which has different metabolism, much lower mitochondrial content (Jackman & Willis,1996; Berchtoldet al.2000; Linet al.2002), low PGC-1α expression (Linet al.2002) and different redox balance response to disuse (Broccaet al.2010). We show that: (1) HU resulted in the early down-regulation of pro-fusion protein expression and mitochondrial dysfunction; (2) energy stress activated the protein degradation pathway through AMPK activation; and (3) gastrocnemius atrophy was totally prevented by muscle-specific over-expression of PGC-1α through stimulation of Mfn2 expression."

        "Title": "Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIsolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.\nSubject terms:\nInterleukins, Physiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIsolation is an important feature of the spaceflight environment. Interplanetary missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will involve mission crew operating in isolated environments for prolonged periods of time. On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations1–3. In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits4.Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses5–8. International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function9and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels10. In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts11. Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight12, linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function.We showed previously that isolation in combination with simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) led to a reduction in the percentage of circulating CD4+ immune cells, which was not observed in social housed HU animals13. This finding suggests that isolation can modify immune responses to simulated spaceflight and that the combination of these two spaceflight stressors can lead to discrete immune deficits. However, the combined effects of isolation and microgravity on neuroimmune outcomes are not defined. Excess production of free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species, ROS) have been linked to neuroinflammation14. Yet there have been few studies exploring oxidative damage as a mechanism by which space environmental factors, singly or in combination, mediate aspects of CNS immune responses. To address these gaps in knowledge, HU was conducted on paired (social) and single housed wild-type and MCAT mice, a genetic model for mitochondrial ROS quenching. MCAT mice overexpress the human catalase gene targeted to the mitochondria15, a major site of cellular ROS production. MCAT mice display decreased oxidative damage and H2O2production.The MCAT transgenic model15was developed to enable testing various aspects of the free radical theory of aging16, which posits that cells, tissues, and organisms age due to an accumulation of oxidative damage via excess production of ROS. Overexpression of catalase when targeted specifically to the mitochondria, but not when targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm, prolongs murine lifespan and reduces age-related cardiovascular17–19and cognitive deficits20sharing features with known or anticipated effects of spaceflight21–25. Findings from human astronauts long ago led to the proposal that spaceflight and advancing age share physiological consequences26, leading us to question if they also share molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we determined whether the MCAT transgene also is protective using a ground-based model that simulates important aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, and isolation.MCAT mice show increased median and maximum lifespans (5 months, and 5.5 months, respectively)15and are protected from a number of aging-associated pathologies. For example, MCAT mice display protection from cardiovascular deficits17–19and Alzheimer’s disease-related amyloid deposition27. Further, the brains of MCAT mice indicate the rescue of simulated space radiation-induced decrements in neurogenesis28and neuronal spine morphology29. The overexpression of catalase also quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages30, suggesting that catalase can impact oxidative signaling in inflammatory cells. MCAT mice also exhibit enhanced hippocampal spatial learning, memory, and reduced contextual fear conditioning15,20.Altered cognitive function is thought to be one of the risks associated with long-duration spaceflight31. The production of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors are involved in hippocampal neuropathy. Prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity by HU is associated with increased hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers, which may increase injury32. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in HU mice reveals changes in structural proteins coupled with the loss of proteins involved in cell metabolism33. In addition, microgravity leads to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in animals34.Cytokines are important mediators of both innate and adaptive immunity. They are produced by resident immune cells in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and in circulation35,36. There is emerging evidence that cytokines contribute to the detrimental effects of isolation triggered by disease or injury37,38. For example, hippocampal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly increased 24 h after ischemia in isolated mice compared to untreated controls, but not in pair-housed mice37,38. In humans as well as animals, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity (bedrest) can lead to changes in cytokine expression10,12,39–42.Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that isolation and simulated microgravity lead to altered hippocampal cytokine expression via mitochondrial ROS-related mechanisms. Hippocampal alterations, e.g., oxidative damage, spatial changes, and genetic alterations have been reported in both actual and modeled microgravity32,43–46and linked to behavioral deficits47. These higher CNS functions are critical for astronaut performance during extended periods of spaceflight. Therefore, the hippocampus was selected as the focus of the current study. We found that quenching mitochondrial ROS mitigated the effects of both simulated microgravity and isolation in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial ROS mechanisms in CNS responses to these stressors, thereby providing a rationale for testing possible use of antioxidants to mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration as well as bedrest and isolation on Earth."

This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation [1–3]. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A2is activated [4,5]. The canonical pathway then diverges, depending on whether the fatty acid substrate is processed by a cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or a P450 epoxygenase (P450E). The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [6–8] whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins [9]. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) [10,11]. The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) [12]. These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes [2,3,12–14]The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans. The COX enzymes (prostaglandin G/H synthases) are encoded byCOX-1(PTGS1) andCOX-2(PTGS2) [6].COX-1is constitutively expressed at low levels by most cells. In contrast,COX-2is upregulated at sites of inflammation and during tumor progression [6,15]. COX-1 and COX-2 are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that catalyze the conversion of an 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, typically AA, an ω-6, 20-carbon fatty acid) into prostaglandins G2and H2[16]. Although AA is the preferred substrate, the COX enzymes are known to oxygenate eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with varying efficiencies [16–18]. This initial substrate choice is significant, as it determines whether the downstream prostanoid will tend to be pro- or anti-inflammatory. Fatty acids with two double bonds (e.g., AA) are converted into series-2 prostanoids (e.g., PGH2, PGE2), which are associated with pro-inflammatory signaling. In contrast, fatty acid substrates with three or four double bonds (e.g., EPA, DHLA, respectively) yield series-1 and 3 prostanoids (PGH1, PGE3), which are associated with anti-inflammatory signaling. Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes [8,10]. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate pro-inflammatory products, are particularly important. PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of downstream eicosanoids, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF1αPGF2α, PGI2(prostacyclin), and the thromboxanes TXA2and TXB2. The downstream processing route depends on the availability of enzymes in a given cell type. For example, endothelial cells primarily produce PGI2, whereas platelets mainly produce TXA2[19].The LOX pathway operates independently from the COX pathway, diverging at the initial fatty acid processing stage. In humans, LOX enzymes are encoded by several genes (ALOX5,ALOX12,ALOX12B,ALOX15). Mammalian LOX enzymes catalyze the stereospecific dehydrogenation and dioxygenation of a PUFA, such as AA or LA, leading to the formation of a hydroxyperoxide containing a 1-hydroxyperoxy-2-trans-4-cis-pentadiene fragment [13,20]. The mammalian LOXs have been named according to the position of the carbon at which the oxygen molecule is inserted into AA, the primary fatty acid substrate,e.g., as 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX) [21]. The primary products are 5S-, 12S-, or 15S-HPETE, which can be further reduced by glutathione peroxidase to hydroxy forms (5-, 12-, 15-HETE), respectively [20,21]. 5-LOX is the only LOX that produces leukotrienes, and it is notable that catalytic activity requires the presence of a second protein (ALOX5AP), though the precise function of Five-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) is not known [20,22]. Following conversion of a fatty acid into 5-HPETE, downstream processing results in the terminal leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The leukotrienes are clinically significant, as they are implicated in the allergic response and maintenance of chronic inflammation. 15-LOX (and to a lesser extent 5-LOX) produce the lipoxins LXA and LXB [23].CYP450Es convert fatty acid substrates (e.g., AA) into four EET isomers, 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs, which function as autocrine and paracrine mediators. CYP450Es also convert EPA into epoxy-derivatives, and endocannabinoids containing 11,12- and 14,15-EETs [12]. The CYP450E protein is not examined in this study.The COX family enzymes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom, with orthologs found in the primitive marine corals as well as the higher vertebrates [24]. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify COX orthologs in the known genomes of insects, unicellular organisms, or plants, although prostaglandins, their primary products, have been found in some of these organisms [25–28]. Recent studies have suggested that an insect cyclooxygenase may exist in orthologs of theDrosophilagenePxt[27,29,30]. LOX enzymes display an even broader degree of conservation, with orthologs found across the animal kingdom and in a variety of plants [9]. Sequence and biochemical analyses have failed to identify any insect LOX orthologs, with the exception of LOX activity in the primitive insect,Thermobia domestica[31] and one report inD.melanogaster[28]. Thus, there is conflicting information regarding the existence of functional COX or LOX pathway in insects. Given the complexity and biomedical importance of eicosanoid biology, defining the COX and LOX pathways in a model organism is a research priority. Identification of a functionally conserved COX or LOX pathway inD.melanogasteropens up exciting research avenues for understanding the genetic basis of eicosanoid-mediated inflammation in this well-established and simple model organism.To this end, we conducted a thorough computational analysis of the genome ofD.melanogaster. While an initial BLAST search revealed candidates for the most conserved enzymes, it failed to identify likely orthologs for some of these enzymes. A more rigorous approach using iterative sequence searches combined with structural modeling revealed a surprising degree of similarity between mammalian and fly enzymes and the apparent conservation of functionally important residues even in these most distant candidate enzymes. Although we could not identify any suitable candidates for lipoxygenase enzymes, other component enzymes of the LOX branch of the pathway were identified. This suggests the possibility that eicosanoid pathway may adopt a non-canonical form inD.melanogasterand insects in general. Our study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid pathway and opens up tremendous possibilities of utilizing a well-established model organism for eicosanoid research."

        "Title": "Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLeptopilina heterotoma\nare obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their\nDrosophila\nhosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of\nL. heterotoma\nMSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of\nL. heterotoma\nMSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the\nL. heterotoma\nMSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and\nde novo\nassembly of the 460 Mb-sized\nL. heterotoma\ngenome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.\nKeywords:\nExtracellular vesicle, whole genome sequencing,\nLeptopilina heterotoma\n, endoparasitoid wasp,\nDrosophila\n, VLP, host-parasite, organelle, immune suppression",

        "Title": "Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhile it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that\nSerratia marcescens\n(strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to\nDrosophila melanogaster\nafter growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of\nS. marcescens\ndid not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways\nImd\nand\nToll\n, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.\nSubject terms:\nInfection, Innate immunity, Microbiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response ofDrosophila melanogasteris highly similar to humans,25,27,28with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29The human opportunistic bacteriaSerratia marcescenshas only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31Furthermore,S. marcescenshas been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens.D. melanogasterhas been recently used as a model for studyingS. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes toS. marcescensusing a model system.Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogenSerratia marcescenswas sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infectD. melanogasterto investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence ofSerratia marcescensonD. melanogasterhosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of theD. melanogasterhost and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground."

        "Title": "A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe wasps\nLeptopilina heterotoma\nparasitize and ingest their\nDrosophila\nhosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for\nL\n.\nheterotoma\nEVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in\nDrosophila\n. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that\nL\n.\nheterotoma\ninfection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of\nL\n.\nheterotoma\ninfection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside,\nL\n.\nheterotoma\nEVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as\nRab5\nknockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for\nL\n.\nheterotoma\nare likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionParasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [1–3].Drosophilaand their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [4,5]. The generalistLeptopilina heterotoma(Lh) succeeds on theDrosophilaspecies within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative,L.boulardi(Lb), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. Both wasps are highly successful onD.melanogaster; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free-living adults [6].Oviposition into second-to-early-thirdD.melanogasterlarval hosts byLbandLhwasps yields divergent immunological effects.Lbinfection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity: Toll-NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells (also called hemocytes) in the lymph gland and in circulation. If the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [7–11].Lhinfection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [12,13].LbandLhfemales (and alsoL.victoriae, a sister species ofLh) produce discrete immune-suppressive extracellular vesicle- (EV) like structures in their venom glands (called multi-strategy extracellular vesicles, MSEVs inLhand venosomes inLb) [14,15]. Previously called virus like particles [16–18], these EVs lack clear viral features [15,19]. They are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. The secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non-spiked vesicle-like structures. In sister speciesLhandLv, these structures mature in the reservoir and assume a stellate morphology with 4–8 spikes radiating from the center. Mature EVs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, [14,16,20–22]. Packed with more than 150 proteins, EVs are, in part, responsible for divergent physiological outcomes in infected hosts [15,19,23].Among the most abundant in theLhEV proteins is a 40 kDa surface/spike protein (SSp40) [20]. SSp40 shares structural similarities with the IpaD/SipD family of proteins of the gastroenteric disease-causing Gram negative bacteria,ShigellaandSalmonella[15]. Similar to SSp40’s localization toLhEV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages [24,25]. These parallels betweenLhSSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest thatLhEVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems. Comparative transcriptomic/proteomic approaches revealed that SSp40 and a few other EV proteins are not expressed in theLbvenom [15].WhereasLhEVs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack,LbEVs do not have the same effect [7,16,26]. Our immune-inhibition experiments suggested thatLh’s SSp40 mediates EV interactions with lamellocytes [20].Lhinfection also uniquely promotes apoptosis of larval macrophages and of lymph gland hemocytes [13]. Macrophages make up more than 95% of all hematopoietic cells while differentiated lamellocytes are rarely found in naïve hosts [8–10,27]. Work in the field strongly suggests that the protein activities concentrated within theLhEVs are responsible for the destruction of these mature and immature blood cells. However, how a macro-endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes ofLhEV entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood.The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view ofLhEV interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection. The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles [28–30]. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes (Fig 1A). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors [31,32]. UponLbinfection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation [30,32–39]. The entire structure is covered by the acellular basement membrane [28,40].Fig 1.LhEVs associate with the larval lymphatic system.Open in a new tab(A) Anterior lobes (ALs, without lamellocytes) from a naïveAntp>mCD8GFP Dome-MESO-GFP(AntpDMG) animal shows medullary zone (MZ), cortical zone (CZ) and posterior signaling center (PSC).

(L) Circulating hemocytes from infected animals.UsingDrosophilagenetics, cell-specific markers and SSp40 staining as a proxy forLhEV localization, we have pieced together a broad view of this host-parasite interaction interface. We show an abundance ofLhEVs in (a) the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, (b) along the collagen/perlecan-based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors, and (c) inside the progenitor and mature macrophages. Moreover, high EV signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive PSC unit. PSC ablation limits EV internalization and loss of lymph gland hemocytes, while PSC inactivation viahedgehog(hh) knockdown (KD) does not have this effect. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytoseLhEVs using the classical Rab5-mediated retrograde transport (RGT) pathway. Surprisingly, Rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, asRab5KD leads to over-proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis;Rab5function is cell-autonomous. Thus lymph glands are not merely a source of mature blood cells but are themselves immune competent organs and can clear the immune-suppressiveLhEVs to defend the host. However,LhEVs proactively dislodge cells of the PSC, blocking differentiation of the protective immune cells.LhEVs target the endomembrane system of macrophages that ultimately results in their apoptosis, thus highlighting central and previously unrecognized roles of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. These observations help explain whyLhinfections target the larval lymph gland. The direct EV-macrophage interactions and cellular outcomes set the stage for future molecular analyses in both the hosts and parasites."

Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the\nDrosophila\nDrosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionIn host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [1,2]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [3]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [4,5,6,7].TheLeptopilina/Drosophilasystem is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [8]. To suppress host immunity,Leptopilinafemales introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [4,9,10]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms inDrosophila[11,12,13] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialistL. boulardiactivates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such asdrosomycinis activated afterL. boulardiinfection [14]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [15,16], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [17,18]. In contrast, infection by the generalistL. heterotomasuppresses both immune pathways [9,14], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [19,20].In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of anL. heterotomapeptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in theL. heterotomavenom but not inL. boulardivenom [21]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [21,22,23]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [24]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [25,26] to snails [27]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [28] and cone snail venom [27], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [26], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [25,26,29] and invertebrates [30].The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence [30]. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design [30], potentially even for cancer treatments [31].Various lines of experimental evidence demonstrate or suggest antimicrobial capabilities for different knottins [25,26,29,30,32,33] or gated ion channel interactions [28,34], although the molecular mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known if these antimicrobial functions share a common mechanism of action. Given its discovery from immune-suppressive particles from fly parasites, our goals were to (a) identify LhKNOT-related sequences from diverse organisms, includingL. heterotoma,L. boulardi, andGanaspisparasitoids, that attackDrosophilaand (b) identify any novel structural motif(s) present in the known or new LhKNOT homologs with the hope that the prediction of such a conserved motif might suggest possible functions for LhKNOT and guide future experimental research.We show that a theoretical model of LhKNOT possesses the hallmarks of the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta sheets, constrained by disulfide bridges. The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation) [35]. Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even theDrosophilaDrosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs fromL. heterotoma,L. boulardi, andGanaspisspp. wasps successfully onD. melanogaster. These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from threeDrosophilaparasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions."

This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with theDrosophilamodel organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight onD. melanogasterinfested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission.Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from.Drosophilalarvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7Encapsulation of the parasite egg byDrosophilalarvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful.Leptopilina heterotoma(Lh) is highly successful on manyDrosophilaspecies and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10LhEVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12L. boulardi(Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range thanLh.8,13LbEVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar toLhEVs.13,14,15,16There is no evidence that eitherLborLhEV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes ofLhEVs are present in the wasp genome.12While the venom EVs from bothLbandLhare immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly.LbEVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17LhEVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19LhEVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains: one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22,23,24Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23,24,25,26In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue.27,28Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation inhopTum-llarvae are sensitive to aspirin administration.24Thus, thehopTum-lbackground is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22,23,24In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity ofLhfrom space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of spaceL. heterotoma.Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms."

        "Title": "Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDuring space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μ\nG\n) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μ\nG\non the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μ\nG\n. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μ\nG\n. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μ\nG\nconditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μ\nG\nsimultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1\nG\ncondition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μ\nG\nconditions.\nKeywords:\nlymphoblast, microgravity, space radiation, chromosome aberration",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionAstronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity (μG) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceflight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative effective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv) [1]. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells [2]. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk [3,4], but also negatively affects the function of the cardiovascular [5,6], central nervous [7,8] and immune [9,10,11] systems. The effects of μGon mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that μGaffects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates [12,13,14,15].In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the effect of exposing cells simultaneously to μGand space radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts’ health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined effects of space radiation and μG, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.) [16]. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental effects), but some did not. Performing experiments in space is challenging since there is a limited number of opportunities (if any) to repeat the same experiment under the same condition. The sequential treatments, such as cells being irradiated and then exposed to simulated μG, have been used in some ground-based experiments. In these experiments, cells are not exposed to radiation and μGat the same time. There are only a few cases in which cells were irradiated while being under the simulated μGcondition. However, for the experiments of this type, it was often necessary to stop clinostat rotation in order to irradiate cells. Recently, we have developed a ground-based system for irradiating cells while they are under simulated μGusing a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat [17,18] as a new system for ground-based space environment studies. This system allows the irradiating of cells without stopping the rotation of the clinostat, hence it is truly simultaneous exposure. As the clinostat rotates, the platform on which cell culture chambers are mounted becomes perpendicular to the direction of the irradiation beam every minute. Cells are irradiated for 0.2 s with either X-ray or carbon ion (C-ion) beam. For X-ray irradiation, a high-speed shutter located in front of the beam port opens for 0.2 s. For C-ion bean irradiation, a respiratory gating system for heavy ion treatment is used.Using these experimental set-ups, we have earlier studied the combined effects of radiation and μGon human fibroblasts, which are adherent cells. We found that the expression of cell cycle-suppressing genes decreased, and that of cell cycle-promoting genes increased after C-ion irradiation under μGcompared with irradiation [19]. The cell cycle may pass through the checkpoints with DNA damage due to the combined effects of C-ion and μG, suggesting that increased genomic instability might occur in space [19]. Indeed, we also found an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cells exposed to both radiation and μG, compared to those treated by radiation only [20].In this work, we studied the combined effects of simulated μGand irradiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, which were originally isolated from spontaneous immortalized lymphoblastic WIL2 cells [21]. TK6 cells are relatively stable and express the wild-type tumor suppressorp53gene [22]. Unlike fibroblasts that are adherent cells, TK6 cells grow in suspension. TK6 cells are commonly used in radiation studies to investigate genomic instability [23,24,25] and known to be highly radiosensitive due to efficient radiation-induced apoptosis [26]. The endpoints measured in this study were cell survival and CA."

        "Title": "Genes required for survival in microgravity revealed by genome-wide yeast deletion collections cultured during spaceflight.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionPhysical effects of microgravity during spaceflight can often be described by equations that allow their quantification [1,2]. For example, microgravity has well-defined effects on sedimentation in association with reduced terminal velocity and shear in suspension culture [3] and reduced gravity-dependent convection of gases [4]. Biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are much harder to define [1,2]. For example, spaceflight also entails radiation exposure, which has been studied in diverse systems but whose effects are not fully understood [5]. What is needed is a robust, unbiased, quantifiable system that is relevant for translation to ground-based applications and that is able to clearly distinguish spaceflight effects. It is our premise that yeast deletion collections are ideally suited for this type of analysis as yeast can be precisely controlled genetically and readily grown under spaceflight conditions. Biological responses of yeast strains during spaceflight can be quantified and compared to well-established databases of ground-based stressors and the comparisons can reveal features that are unique to microgravity as well as features that are shared with ground-based perturbations. While yeast cannot completely reflect the complexities of mammalian cells organized into tissues, the high degree of homology shared with human (~70% of all essential yeast genes have a significant human homolog) provides hypotheses for the mechanism of many responses of interest [6,7].Previous studies have attempted to identify, isolate, and offset the various physical factors changing during spaceflight to demonstrate their effects in an iterative fashion [8–10]. Earlier studies on the effects of space radiation on yeast failed to find any change in point mutation rates, DNA replication and/or repair, heritable damage, or colony morphology [5,8,11,12]. However, those studies were limited by assay sensitivity. Here we applied the yeast deletion collection as a biological reporter to understand the metabolic pathways affecting survival during culture in spaceflight. In this fashion, we are able to make genome-wide comparisons and test for concordance against an extensive library of more than 3200 physical and pharmacological stressors [13].Yeast is the first, and to date only, organism for which a complete, genome-wide knockdown collection is available. This collection is comprised of a genome-wide set of strains where each strain carries a precise deletion of a single gene [14]. Assembled over a four-year period by a consortium of 35 laboratories, this collection has been used by hundreds of laboratories to test thousands of different environmental stressors to define the genes required for survival in those conditions (see [15] for review). The molecular barcodes present in each strain allow the yeast deletion collection to be grown as a pool in the presence or absence of the stressor of interest after which the relative abundance of each strain is subsequently quantified [16]. Strains carrying a deletion of a gene required for survival in the presence of the stressor grow more slowly and thus exhibit a fitness defect reflected by their reduced abundance at the end of the culture period. In this manner, all genes required for growth can be readily identified in a single experiment, revealing the genes and associated pathways affected by the stressor.To identify the metabolic and genomic pathways affected by spaceflight, the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections were grown in spaceflight and ground control conditions, with and without hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second stressor. In spaceflight alone, the homozygous deletion collection revealed the importance of processes linked to mitochondria, while the heterozygous collection highlighted genes involved in regulating translation and ribosomal RNA transport. Both homozygous and heterozygous collections highlighted DNA repair. With the addition of NaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed the importance of RNA-related processes including ribosome assembly and biogenesis and mRNA processing and decay, as well as modification of tRNAs. Moreover, the NaCl addition highlighted replication processes more clearly (compared to the homozygous collection without NaCl), suggesting that spaceflight has measurable effects on these core and evolutionarily conserved processes. With the heterozygous collection, the addition of NaCl led to the identification of a nuclear pore organization gene, potentially providing additional insight into how RNA transport is affected by spaceflight. Taken together, the deletion collections identified several biological processes associated with spaceflight, and the additional hyperosmolar stress emphasized the importance of related processes.In a follow-up analysis, we queried the effects of spaceflight against a database of drug effects on yeast to search for those that are most concordant, thereby suggesting similar mechanisms of perturbation. Not only do the effects of spaceflight have relatively high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents, but also there is tight agreement amongst multiple therapeutic agents in this drug class, providing additional support for these findings."

        "Title": "Physical Forces Modulate Oxidative Status and Stress Defense Meditated Metabolic Adaptation of Yeast Colonies: Spaceflight and Microgravity Simulations",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBaker’s yeast (\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.\nKeywords:\nYeast, Microgravity, Reactive oxygen species, Spaceflight, Shear stress, Random positioning machine, Apoptosis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaehas broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al.2014; Kachroo et al.2015; Nislow et al.2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al.2009a; Ayer et al.2014; Herker et al.2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al.2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al.2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaegrown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small moleculesin vivoincluding chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al.2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al.2009a,2010,2012a,d).Yeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified thatS. cerevisiaeremains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz1979) and phenotype [e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al.1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al.2007,2008a,b; Hammond et al.1999; Johanson et al.2002; Nislow et al.2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al.2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al.2008a).Little is known about the effects of spaceflight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al.2009b,2012b,c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al.2009a; Palkova et al.1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process.To answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (e.g. spaceflight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond and Hammond2001; Lee et al.2014; Birdsall et al.2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al.2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al.2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al.2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al.2004; Murdoch et al.2013; Wuest et al.2017).Metabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al.2009a; Palkova et al.1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media.Three major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table1lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al.2012a,d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in spaceflight (Walther et al.1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al.2016; Cap et al.2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker2004).Table 1.Clones selected for studyStandard nameSystematic nameDescriptionReason for selectionATO3YDR384CPutative ammonium transporterUpregulated in the upper cells of giant yeast coloniesINO1YJL153CInositol-3-phosphate synthaseUpregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast coloniesTRR1YDR353WThioRedoxin ReductaseKey control enzyme in redox which is altered in spaceflightBEM1YBR200WInvolved in buddingBud scarring is altered in spaceflight in liquid culturesEDC3YEL015WEnhancer of mRNA DeCappingConstitutive controlRPL34BYIL052CStress response geneUpregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; Dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid culturesSSA4YER103WStress response geneUpregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid culturesSfp1YLR403WStress-responsive transcriptional regulatorDifferential effect on SSA4 and RPL34B in microgravity vs ground-based liquid culturesMsn4YKL062WStress-responsive transcriptional regulatorDifferential effect on SSA4 and RPL34B in microgravity ground-based liquid culturesOpen in a new tabSecond, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters, Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al.2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during spaceflight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al.2008a).Third, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al.2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known.We have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al.2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of spaceflight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation."

Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, microgravity, gene expression, liver, kidney, gene array, gene expression, transcriptome, apoptosis, Cdkn1a, CYP4A1",

Many gene and gene pathway changes associated with changes due to the diverse stimuli of spaceflight have been identified: microgravity, radiation exposure, reduction, and reduction of convection, to say nothing about the effects of launch, maneuvers, and landing.By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we can test a unique hypothesis: Are there tissue specific gene expression pathways activated in individual tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? For pathways that are common, do the same genes predominate, or is the distribution of contributing pathway specific genes differ? Using liver and kidney harvested from the same mice after spaceflight and identically housed ground controls, direct comparison can be made between tissues without confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in microbiome and epigenetics.The mice flew on space shuttle flight STS-108, also known as Utilization Flight 1 (UF-1), to the International Space Station. Data were not published immediately due to a laboratory loss occurred during Hurricane Katrina. We present the data now because contemporary analysis methods can be applied to this unique data set to directly address unanswered but relevant questions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace exploration is a long-term dream and pursuit of humanity, and it is also one of the important fields of technological development. In long-term space flight, astronauts face many problems. One of them is the reduction of gravitational force. Terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and long-term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological changes1. Numerous studies have shown that long-term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and nervous system2. Prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. One of the crucial issues is the impact of long-term spaceflight on brain function. Studies have shown that astronauts experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment3. The high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. Currently, tail-suspension hindlimb unloading is the most classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system4. However, this model has certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal. Besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption5.Three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device that generates multi-directional G forces. By controlling the rotation on both axes, it can offset the cumulative gravity vector at the center of the device6. Previous studies have shown that 3D clinostat have been widely used on plants, cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to simulate microgravity effects7–9. Our previous studies suggest that the central nervous system probably changed in mice trained with 3D clinostat10. Therefore, the aim of our work is to systematically assess 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice by behavioral and multi group analysis, focusing on the changes in central nervous system and cognitive function."

        "Title": "Role of shear stress on renal proximal tubular cells for nephrotoxicity assays",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIncreased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm\n2\nor higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.\nKeywords:\ncontrast-induced nephropathy, kidney-on-a-chip, acute kidney injury, contrast media",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionContrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major health problem that manifests as an abrupt decline in renal function after iodine contrast exposure. CIN is known as the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [1]. CIN contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and prolonged length of hospital stay. Moreover, the rapidly increasing use of computed tomography scans or interventions using contrast agents, such as angiography, is raising concerns regarding CIN. In addition, there are limited options for the prevention and treatment of CIN, including fluid therapy and avoidance of additional nephrotoxins. Potential pathogenic mechanisms of CIN include vasoconstriction, medullary hypoxia, direct cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and increased tubular fluid viscosity [2]. Previous experimental studies have mainly focused on direct tubular toxicity, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress following contrast exposure [3].Many researchers have linked the physicochemical properties of iodinated contrast materials to CIN. The administered volume, osmolality, and viscosity of contrast media (CM) may be related to nephrotoxicity [4]. Indeed, high-osmolar ionic CM is no longer used because of the high risk of adverse drug reactions and renal toxicity [5]. Currently, two types of contrast agents are widely used in clinical practice: high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) and low-viscosity low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM). IOCM has an osmolality similar to that of blood (290 mOsm/kg), while LOCM has a higher osmolality (600–900 mOsm/kg) than IOCM. Some studies have suggested the superiority of IOCM over LOCM in the prevention of CIN [6,7]. However, there was no difference in the overall risk of CIN according to the type of CM in meta-analyses [8,9]. It still remains unclear which of these two types of CM is better for renal safety.To date, the effect of CM viscosity on renal function has not been fully investigated due to the difficulty in experimental methodology. Accurately controlling and measuring fluid viscosity and shear stress is challenging in conventional experimental designs. Under in vivo conditions, the high viscosity of IOCM can be harmful to renal function. IOCM is further concentrated in the renal medulla with increasing viscosity, particularly in dehydrated individuals, which increases intraluminal pressure and decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [10]. Nevertheless, previous in vitro studies in static conditions showed that LOCM has more cytotoxic effects than IOCM [11]. However, this static condition does not reflect the rheological effects of CM. Given that animal models for CIN are not well established and clinical trials are much harder to implement due to high cost and ethical issues [12], alternative experimental approaches are warranted. In the field of nephrology, organ-on-a-chip technology is gradually being utilized for physiological in vitro disease models [13]. One of the key features of the organ-on-a-chip is the exposure of cells to easily controlled microfluidic conditions, which could enable rheological studies. Therefore, organ-on-a-chip experiments could be an alternative approach to bridge the gap between the in vitro and in vivo findings in CIN. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of the rheological factors of LOCM and IOCM using a kidney-on-a-chip platform."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe researches and clinical application of otoendoscope in otologic surgery are increasing, which not only expands otologists’ understanding of otologic anatomy and pathophysiology but also provides a new way for the treatment of otologic diseases.1,2Otoendoscopic surgery is now considered as a safe and feasible surgical method. Natasha Pollak et al found that it could not only enhance the visibility of surgery but also reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis of some ear diseases due to its minimally invasion.1,3However, the surgical field under otoendoscope is relatively narrow, and the light is easily absorbed by dark tissues or objects such as blood, which affects the brightness of the surgical field. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to operate in the narrow ear canal with 1 hand. Therefore, a clearer surgical field and better hemostatic effect are beneficial for the otoendoscopic surgery.Currently, the vasoconstrictor epinephrine is often used as a hemostatic drug in endoscopic surgery of otorhinolaryngology.4,5Some of the most common methods include local injection and submucosal infiltration administration, both of which are effective in reducing the risk of intraoperative bleeding and improving field clarity.6,7But the concentration of epinephrine used by different surgeons varies. Regardless of the administration method or concentration, as epinephrine is absorbed through the mucosa, the patients’ hemodynamics will have changes accordingly.8-11In studies related to otoendoscopic surgery, Ali Moshaver et al found that the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increased 1 to 2 minutes after nasal mucosal injection of 1:200,000 epinephrine and returned to baseline after 5 minutes.12Bi Zhang et al found insufficient evidence to support the use of low concentration of epinephrine in the nasal submucosa to improve surgical clarity and hemostatic effect.13In the researches of otoendoscopic surgery, Marna List et al found that the hemostasis effect of topical application of 1:1000 epinephrine was equivalent to that of 1:10,000 epinephrine, and the safety factor was also similar in 2 groups.14Given the limited research on the use of epinephrine in otoendoscopic surgery, there are also issues such as fewer enrolled patients. We designed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) study to evaluate the effect of 4 different concentrations of epinephrine on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics in otoendoscopic surgery. Our goal was to select an appropriate concentration of epinephrine, while ensuring the safety of patients’ hemodynamic changes, and a clear surgical field can be obtained."

        "Title": "Back pain in space and post-flight spine injury: Mechanisms and countermeasure development",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND CONTEXT:\nProlonged microgravity exposure is associated with localized low back pain and an elevated risk of post-flight disc herniation. Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population.\nPURPOSE:\nThis study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS).\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nThis is a prospective longitudinal study.\nSAMPLE:\nSix astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample.\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\nFor\nmultifidus\nand\nerector spinae\nat L3–L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1–S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up.\nMETHODS:\n3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired\nt\ntests and regression analyses.\nRESULTS:\nSupine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r\n2\n=0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r\n2\n=0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r\n2\n=0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOn Earth, the lumbar spine bears the load of the upper body in upright posture and is stabilized by both passive and active systems [1]. Passive postural stability is provided by the osteoligamentous lumbar spine, which includes the intervertebral discs, vertebrae, synovial facet joint cartilage, and ligaments. This passive system serves to constrain motion via a mixture of complex tissue material properties and geometries. By contrast, active postural stability is provided by muscle tendon complexes that generate force, both locally at the vertebral segments and globally [2,3]. Some muscles act primarily to induce gross trunk movements, whereas others act as stabilizers to support posture and prevent excessive or unwanted motions [4]. Harmony between the passive and active stability systems is coordinated by neural control mechanisms ([1]).Diurnal loading patterns of activity and rest are critical for maintained spine health and function. For instance, as a poro-viscoelastic material, the disc undergoes significant dehydration, height loss, and concomitant decreased bending stiffness after sustained loading [5]. Decreased bending stiffness can lead to increased tissue strains that trigger paraspinal muscle hyperexcitability [6], thereby increasing active stiffness to compensate for deficient passive stiffness. Rest periods allow the disc to osmotically recover water, height, and bio-mechanical properties. Diurnal periods of activity and rest also facilitate transport of nutrients and metabolites to and from cells within the disc matrix and avascular nucleus pulposus.Microgravity exposure removes physiological diurnal loads from the lumbar spine, which can hypothetically disrupt lumbar stabilization by deconditioning both the passive, active, and neural stabilizing systems. Prolonged microgravity is known to cause global muscle atrophy [7] and bone loss [8,9]. It is not surprising therefore, that spaceflight puts astronauts at risk for low back pain and disc injury. In National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies, astronauts experience localized (non-radiating) low back pain during spaceflight (43% incidence [10]) and a 2.8-fold higher prevalence of lumbar disc herniation following spaceflight [11].Yet, the detrimental mechanisms of microgravity on lumbar health are uncertain. Reports of increased post-flight stature suggest that microgravity causes “spinal lengthening” [12,13] perhaps due to accumulated swelling of unloaded discs [14]. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro microgravity simulations which demonstrate increased disc height and passive spinal bending stiffness [15], and in vivo bed rest studies on Earth [14]. It is tempting to conclude that such changes explain the increased risk of post-flight disc herniation, but space studies to date have not been able to demonstrate lumbar disc height changes following spaceflight of either 8 days [16] or 6 months [17] duration. Therefore, how microgravity adversely affects the human lumbar spine remains undetermined.To identify back pain and injury mechanisms, we conducted a longitudinal study of six NASA astronaut crewmembers in whom lumbar spine anatomy and biomechanics were quantified before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on the International Space Station (ISS). Results of this study are valuable not only to inform countermeasures to reduce disc herniation risk in astronauts, but also to provide insights into spine stability that are relevant to improving back health in the general population."

        "Title": "Fifteen days of microgravity causes growth in calvaria of mice",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.\nKeywords:\nbone, adaptation, space, microgravity",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSkeletal adaptation to microgravity is a physiological obstacle that may limit prolonged space exploration [1]. Studies from astronauts demonstrate variable bone loss corresponding to mission length [2,3,4]. Weight-bearing bones such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine and neck lose more bone than non-weight-bearing bones [5], establishing the pivotal role of skeletal unloading on bone remodeling. Physiological studies of the Skylab missions document increasing calcium and phosphate levels in both serum and urine of crewmembers [6], reflecting a gradual loss of bone mineral content in these astronauts. Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years [7]. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts [8,9,10].Development of countermeasures against the osteopenic effect of space travel requires a better understanding of bone adaptation. Human bed-rest is a method used to simulate microgravity without spaceflight. Using this technique, LeBlanc and team demonstrate the greatest bone loss in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, notably the lumbar spine, femur, tibia and the calcaneus [11]. A 60-day bed-rest study reports the greatest loss at the proximal femur and distal tibia [12]. These results are consistent with bone changes induced by spaceflight. Bone measurements on Skylab astronauts show increasing mineral loss in the os calcis corresponding to the length of the mission [4]. A more comprehensive comparison between 18 cosmonauts and bed-rest subjects supports that spaceflight produces similar, if not greater, mineral loss in weight-bearing bones than bed-rest [5]. Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed [4,11,13].To date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body. While modest effort is made to study remodeling of partially-loaded bones (ie: the upper appendages) in response to weightlessness, data on non-loaded bones are scarce and are generated mostly from bed-rest and rodent hind-limb unloading studies. Studies of extended bed-rest and lower-body disuse demonstrate patterns of increased BMD in skull bones along with mineral loss in bones of the lower axial and appendicular skeleton [11,13,14,15]. In their simulated weightlessness experiment, Roer and Dillaman found heavier dry and ash weights of the skulls from hindlimb-suspended rats [16]. However, it is unclear whether the observed adaptations of unloaded bones to inactivity and simulated microgravity reflect the remodeling of these bones in actual microgravity.The present paper attempts to quantify the adaptations of cranial bones to spaceflight. Specifically, our goals are to evaluate the remodeling of skull bones due to actual microgravity, to compare the adaptation of non-loaded bones to actual microgravity versus simulated microgravity as reported in literature, and to quantify these changes based on mineral content and bone volume. We hypothesize that microgravity induces adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight, possibly from headward fluid shifts that accompany actual microgravity."

        "Title": "Altered disc compression in children with idiopathic low back pain: an upright magnetic resonance imaging backpack study",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nStudy Design\nThis study is a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI.\nObjective\nThe purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children.\nSummary of Background Data\nResearch in normal children shows that backpack loads compress the lumbar IVDs, increase lumbar coronal deformity, and increase pain.\nMethods\nFifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner imaged the subjects while supine and standing wearing 0 kg, 4 kg, and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. We compared the above variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized least squares models.\nResults\nThe cohort’s mean age was 13 ± 3 years. The 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks only compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load.\nConclusions\nIn ILBP children, increasing backpack load compresses only the L5-S1 IVD. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing load suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children.\nKeywords:\nbackpacks, children, adolescents, disc compression, Intervertebral disc, idiopathic low back pain, MRI, upright MRI, lumbar lordosis, lumbar asymmetry",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAmong schoolchildren between the ages of 11 and 14 years, the incidence of low back pain is between 24 and 37%.1,2In school children, risk factors for low back pain include female gender, poorer general health, high levels of physical activity, time spent sitting, backpack loads, and a family history of back pain.3In the United States, more than 92% of children carry backpacks that weigh between 10 and 22% of their body weight.2,4–8Of children between 11 and 14 years with low back pain, 82% attribute their pain to backpack use.2One study correlates low back pain in adolescents with both the backpack weight and frequency of carrying a backpack.4In contrast, other studies report that back pain in children is related to psychosomatic factors rather than the weight of the backpack.9,10A recent study investigates the effect of common backpack loads on normal children who never previously reported idiopathic low back pain (ILBP).11They find that increasing backpack load causes significantly more pain.11The authors postulate that this pain increase is probably due to the compression of the lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) heights and the increase in lumbar asymmetry observed as backpack load increased.11Despite concerns that backpacks are associated with back pain in children, there are no radiographic studies of backpack loading in children with ILBP.The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with ILBP. We will then compare these results to previously published normal child data conducted in our laboratory under the same conditions.11We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a significantly different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIntervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, intervertebral disc, four-point bending, herniation, murine",

        "Title": "Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAstronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC,\np\n= 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (\nVEGFA\n) and pro-osteogenic gene (\nBMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2\nand\nOCN\n) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR.\nVEGFA\ngene expression increased 15-fold while\nBMP-2\ngene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.\nKeywords:\nosteogenesis, angiogenesis, BMP-2, VEGFA, spaceflight, long-duration flight, gene expression",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionGravity-dependent retrograde blood flow to upper non-load bearing regions and blood pooling in the brain are linked to increased facial edema, cerebral venous pressure, intracranial blood volume, intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF) and stroke volume (Morey and Baylink, 1978;Collet et al., 1997;Miyamoto et al., 1998;Iwamoto et al., 2005;Arbeille et al., 2015;Marshall-Goebel et al., 2019). In addition, altered cerebral hemodynamics account for neurological symptoms common in astronauts that include visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome, post-flight headaches, syncope, dizziness, and impaired cognitive abilities (Blaber et al., 2011;Mader et al., 2011). The skull is in close proximity to cerebral vessels impacted by microgravity and acts as a stress absorber (Tanaka et al., 2004). Although several spaceflight studies have examined the effects of prolonged shifts in hydrostatic gradients in the load-bearing, lower regions of the body (Morey and Baylink, 1978;Miyamoto et al., 1998;Vico et al., 2000;Gerbaix et al., 2018), few studies have examined vascular structural modifications and gene expression in skull bone, also known as calvaria (Kusumbe et al., 2014;Ramasamy et al., 2014). Calvarial syndesmotic sutures are active regions of growth, movement, and repair (Zimmermann et al., 1998). During development, vascularization precedes early osteogenesis on the thin plate of the skull and is followed by the formation of a plate caudal to the first. In addition, resident stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells in the suture mesenchyme contribute to the repair of stressed or fractured calvarial bones by secreting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and recruiting blood vessels and chondroclasts (Doro et al., 2017). In pathological condition or synostosis, the sutures close prematurely resulting in skeletal malformations seen in genetic disorders (Bellus et al., 1996). Clinically, in children with a small skull base, abnormal calvarial growth and cerebral perfusion increases intracranial pressure (ICP), a trend seen in astronauts (Pierre-Kahn et al., 1980;Sainte-Rose et al., 1984). 30 days of spaceflight have been shown to exacerbate these processes, where an elevation of brain arterial flow increases stiffness, myogenic vasoconstriction, and maximal diameter of the cerebral arteries as mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+mechanisms (Sofronova et al., 1985;Taylor et al., 2013). Our previous work showed a 30% increase in calvarial bone mineral density in mice after 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 flight (Zhang et al., 2013).However, there are few reports on bone vascular adaptations to microgravity at a multi-scale level (Sofronova et al., 1985;Taylor et al., 2013).Based on the state-of-the-research, we propose that calvarial bone and vascular remodeling occurs in response to skeletal unloading, cephalad fluid shifts, and elimination of gravity-oriented hydrostatic gradients. However, the exact adaptation of calvarial vasculature to cephalad fluid shifts is not yet fully characterized. In this line of inquiry, we examine the adaptations in vascular morphology, capillarization, and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in mouse calvaria exposed to microgravity using image morphometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We also provide a comprehensive protocol for the isolation of RNA from thick skull bone tissue in quantities sufficient for determining calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated gene responses."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWaterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses\nMycobacterium marinum\nto determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG).\nM. marinum\nwere grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long).\nM. marinum\nexposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (\nsigH\n) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the\nM. marinum\nLSMMG transcriptome response.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRecent studies have demonstrated that the spacecraft environment can be contaminated with numerous microbial species.1Samples to check for microbes are frequently taken from surfaces, air, and water on the International Space Station (ISS) and tests to identify bacterial species include sequencing of 16s rRNA and culturing viable bacteria.1,2A variety of bacterial phyla have been identified including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, SR1, Tenericutes, and TM7 and a number of genera have been identified within each phylum.1The bacteria most frequently found on the ISS include species ofStaphylococcus,Bacillus, andMicrococcus.2Experiments to determine the effect of spaceflight or low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on bacteria have determined that different phenotypes are induced in different types of bacteria. Compared with normal gravity controls alterations to growth, culture density, biofilm formation, aggregation, virulence, and changes in resistance to stress from acid, oxidative stress, heat shock, or antibiotics have been identified.2–10It is not possible to generalize or predict how a bacterial species will react to microgravity or LSMMG. An example is resistance to oxidative stress: exposure to LSMMG increased oxidative stress resistance ofPseudomonas aeruginosa11but decreased oxidative stress resistance ofStaphylococcus aureus.12Changes in the bacterial transcriptome11–14are also induced by microgravity and LSMMG, and changes to the bacterial phenotype are likely due to alterations in the bacterial transcriptome. The diverse phenotypes induced by spaceflight or LSMMG2–7highlights the need to understand more about how different species of bacteria are altered by microgravity and the importance of identifying key molecules that promote survival under the stress of microgravity.Mycobacterium marinumis a member of a family of closely related mycobacteria, most of which are pathogenic. They includeMycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium avium,andMycobacterium ulcerans.15AlthoughM. tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, live and replicate only in a host in nature,15,16M. marinumandM. aviumgrow in macrophage and aquatic environments.16M. marinumgrows at 28–35 °C and infects poikilothermic hosts such as fish and frogs, but can infect humans resulting in granulomatous skin lesions, which pathologically are identical to lesions produced by dermalM. tuberculosis. The pathogenicM. aviumcomplex, which includes the subspeciesavium,paratuberculosis,andintracellulare, has been linked with hard-to-treat non-tuberculosis human pulmonary infections in non-immunocompromised17as well as immunocompromised individuals.18M. marinum19andM. aviumform biofilms and can grow in biofilms in water distribution systems,20taps, and showerheads. Thirty percent of biofilms tested from showerheads across the USA containedM. aviumeven though they were linked to municipal water supplies treated with chlorine.21M. aviumgrown in a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine, even when the biofilm is disrupted.22Pathogenic waterborne mycobacteria could pose a potential threat during space travel not only to astronaut health, but also to the spacecraft environment and potable water. In fact,M. aviumwas identified in water samples taken from the Russian Mir space station.23Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to have increased antimicrobial resistance and virulence are a concern inside spacecraft because astronauts already have a compromised immune system, especially when in space for long periods of time.24,25Uncovering the signaling pathways that result in the altered physiology of bacteria has the potential to reveal new targets for drug development or disinfection that will be essential for long space flights.There are no published studies on the effect of microgravity or LSMMG on waterborne mycobacteria. Hfq has been identified as a factor regulating microgravity gene expression inP. aeruginosa,13S. aureus,12andSalmonella entericserovar Typhimurium14(S. typhimurium), but mycobacteria do not encode Hfq.26M. marinumis closely related genetically toM. tuberculosisandM. aviumand has similar mechanisms of infection and survival inside host macrophage. Although all of these mycobacterium species can grow in specialized medium in the laboratory,27growth ofM. marinumeven at the lower temperature of 30–32 °C is faster thanM. tuberculosis27andM. avium.28M. marinumis also a lower risk (bisoafety level 2) to researchers. HenceM. marinumis a good model for pathogenic mycobacteria.The aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the adaptation ofM. marinumto the LSMMG stressful environment and determine how LSMMG alters mycobacterium physiology. Two strains ofM. marinum(1218R and LHM4) were used for this study. Strain 1218R was originally isolated from fish and LHM4 was generated from 1218R by integrating a plasmid into the genome that encodes for kanamycin resistance and the red fluorescent protein. Previous work studying the effect of LSMMG on bacteria with doubling times of <1 h exposed the bacteria to LSMMG for 10,2920,3024 h11or 10 generations.31M. marinumhas a doubling time of 6–7 h at 30 °C and hence two exposure times to LSMMG or NG (short ~40 h and long 4 days and ~35 h) were selected to allow the bacteria to undergo multiple replication cycles during the experiments. The exposure protocol was designed so that short and long LSMMG- or NG-exposed cultures were in exponential phase and hence alterations to the transcriptome or resistance to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acid or gamma radiation were due to different exposure times to LSMMG and not due to different phases of growth.In summary, this work characterizes the growth, stress survival, and transcriptome ofM. marinumgrown under LSMMG and identifies nutrient deprivation as a signal involved in changes to gene expression and the sigma factor SigH as a factor modulating the LSMMG transcriptome in a waterborne mycobacterium."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nGravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h\n−1\n) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence.\nKey words:\nmechanostimulation, memory, clinorotation speed and direction, signal persistence, signal saturation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants respond to environmental stimuli such as gravity, light, water, wind and touch. The gravitropic response is an often-cited example of biological signal perception, processing (transduction) and response. Signal perception is attributed to sedimenting or moving amyloplasts.1The physical process is then converted into a biochemical signal that elicits a growth response in the shoot and roots, where differential elongation on the top and bottom flank reestablishes the gravitropic set-point angle. The curvature is the final step in a series of complex processes2,3that include redistribution of auxin (the Cholodny-Went hypothesis), different sensitivities toward auxin and the ability of cells to retain wall plasticity.4While the detailed analysis of the gravitropic signal processing has made significant progress, signal retention or longevity received little attention. The concept of signal persistence inevitably leads to the broader issue of defining processes or conditions responsible for the coordination of more than one stimulus and some evaluation of the significance of the stimuli that determine the overall response such as the curvature after gravistimulation. Any type of signal persistence represents some type of memory, which is typically not attributed to organisms such as plants. However, there are numerous examples of memory effects. Perhaps the earliest tests of induced memory were reported as a consequence of puncturing cotyledons ofBidens pilosusL.5,6The memory effect depended on the removal of the apex; the location and number of injuries and could be categorized as short- and long-term memory. Other retention of mechanostimulation pertains to the hair cells of the Venus fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula);7,8the sensitivity of staminal filaments in thistles,9and probably additional but undocumented phenomena. Memory effects have been linked to temperature10–12drought stress,13,14ozone stress,15and herbivory.16,17As diverse as the remembered stimuli are the underlying mechanisms of memory function. Cold memory depends on methylation of cold-responsive genes18,19that integrates week-long temperature shifts for robust flower induction20and extends over generations.21In addition to epigenetic processes, excess Cl-ions can affect multi-generational changes.22Successful defense mechanisms to previously-experienced herbivory may be linked to biosynthetic pathways, enhanced sensitivity to metabolites, small RNAs,23or elevated levels of ABA.24Memory, although even mathematically modeled,25is difficult to characterize especially for gravistimulation, because an organ (e.g., a horizontally reoriented root) perceives the stimulus for an extended time, during which the stimulus diminishes with the sine of the achieved curvature. The complexity of determining the longevity of a stimulus is further compromised by the variability of the gravitropic set point angle26and its modulation by other factors such as light.27Gravity compensation by clinorotation can be used to distinguish stimulus and response processes because it is possible to separate a pulse of unilateral gravistimulation (angular reorientation) from clinorotation, i.e., gravity-compensated, but omnilateral mechanostimulation. This approach has been used for the determination of the minimal (presentation) time required to elicit curvature.28,29Despite the usefulness of a clinostat as a gravity compensator, it introduces its own problems such as the destruction of columella cells in the root cap.30,31Clinostat-induced complications are likely to interfere with the original gravistimulus and sensed and probably processed as mechanostimulation that is superimposed to the gravity stimulus and response. A sufficiently small angular velocity during clinorotation is likely to minimize not only centrifugal effects but also damage is response to constant reorientation. Although clinostats are traditionally used at one to two revolutions per minute, a thorough analysis of the angular velocity has not been done despite the possibility of separating gravicompensation (lack of induction of curvature in examined organs) from effects of mechanostimulation (the response of tissue compression and stretching during periodic weight-changes, or (over)stimulation of gravisensors (amyloplast movement and statocyte stimulation). Therefore, varying the angular velocity of a clinostat but maintaining all other experimental parameters is likely to identify mechanostimulatory effects that affect gravicompensation. Such separation can then be used to estimate the persistence of a gravity stimulus. Similarly, increasing the duration of gravistimulation will estimate the amount of time required to saturate the gravitropic signal. The direction of clinorotation, e.g., rotation around the longitudinal axis or an axis perpendicular to the root growth direction has been shown to affect the stress level32and therefore can be used to distinguish stimulation of receptors in lateral columella cell regions from domain characteristic for apical and basal wall regions.We attempt to provide insight in the memory capacity of the root gravisensing system of flax seedlings as a function of angular velocity over one order of magnitude (one octave) while remaining below the threshold level of gravisensitivity (10−3g equivalents33–35) as a result of centrifugal forces. The results indicate a pronounced effect of the direction of clinorotation on response to but not memory of the stimulus."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (\nBrassica oleracea\nL. var\n. botrytis\n) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.\nKeywords:\nBrassica oleracea\nL\n.\nvar.\nbotrytis\n, Priming agents, Seed priming, Salt stress responses, Germination emergence",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSalinity with a high sodium chloride concentration (≥40 mM) in soil or irrigation water is the main concern worldwide in the context of rapid climatic changes due to its impact on nearly 20% of the world's total agricultural land, and the economics of crop production [[1],[2],[3],[4]]. Simultaneously, the requirement to feed 9.3 billion people by 2050 is driving agricultural output into marginal regions, necessitating a significant advancement in the development of saline-tolerant crops [5,6]. The most susceptible stages to salinity are seed germination and seed establishment. Salinity triggers adverse changes in biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes in the growing seeds [7,8]. Reduced water availability, ionic imbalance, the altered release of reserve nutrients, and changes in protein structural organization are some of the few consequences of salinity on seed germination [9,10]. Besides, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative damage to protein and lipids, DNA and RNA breakage, cell leakage, damage to cell membranes and organelles, loss of photosynthetic components, and cell death [11,12].Seed priming is an age-old technique that has been proven to be an inexpensive, efficient, practical, and safe pre-sowing approach to combat the salinity-induced growth and developmental limitation of plants and to promote cost-effective and sustainable crop production on salt-affected soil [[13],[14],[15],[16],[17]]. Seed priming has been shown to be beneficial by promoting seed germination parameters, facilitating seedling development with an enhanced vigour, and boosting water and minerals uptake, under various abiotic stress conditions such as drought [18], chilling [19], salinity [20], heat [21,22], and heavy metals [23,24], etc.There are various approaches to seed priming such as hydropriming, halopriming, osmopriming, hormoprimimg, biopriming, thermopriming, and solid matrix priming [[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30]]. The consequences of priming are influenced by the priming agent, the duration of priming, and the dosage of priming agents [31]. There are several reports that water [[32],[33],[34]], sodium chloride [[35],[36],[37],[38],[39]], thiourea [40], proline [41], and polyethylene glycol [42,43] have been proven to be efficient priming agents for improving germination, seedling establishment, vigour, and tolerance under salinity stress. However, a large percentage of these findings are focused on germination parameters of model crops and cereals such asArabidopsis, chili, tomato, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, etc.Brassica oleraceaL. represents a popular cash crop and the second most economical cooked vegetable after potato of the family Brassicaceae. It is recognised as the chief nutrient-rich crop, including a broad variety of phytochemicals with health-promoting qualities such as antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and tocopherols and some clinically important sulfur containing metabolites, i.e. cynidine, glucosinolates, siringin, etc. [44,45]. Therefore, ingestion of these cruciferous veggies has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular [46,47] and neurological diseases [48], type 2 diabetes [49], and malignancies such as colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers [[50],[51],[52],[53]]. As a result,Brassica oleraceaL. crops, such as broccoli (var.italica), cabbage (var.capitata), cauliflower (var.botrytis), brussels sprouts (var.gemmifera) and kale (var.acephala) are classified as functional foods and considered as “Super Veggies” [54]. On an annual basis, 20 metric tonnes of cauliflower and broccoli are grown on 1.6 thousand acres throughout the world. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) of the United Nations, China and India are the world's largest producers, generating 1.42 million ha area having the annual production of 26.90 million tonnes per year, accounting for 74% of global production (FAO, 2019) [55,56]. However, these varieties sternly challenged by saline circumstances lead to a reduction in crop growth. Among theB.oleraceavarieties, Cauliflower (B.oleraceaL. var.botrytis) is generally considered moderately salt tolerant [57]. India produces around 13% of global vegetable output and ranks first in cauliflower [58], but as soil salinity rises, crop production and economic outputs may begin to fall. ManyB. oleraceacrops are now struggling with the effects of salt and other abiotic stressors as a result of intensive field usage of different fertilizers and the fast expansion of protected farming land [59,60]. However, scar attempts have been made to combat and ameliorate the possible adverse salt stress influence in cauliflower. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming agents on the seed germination indices, seedling performance, and physio-biochemical attributes of cauliflower (Brassica oleraceaL. var.botrytis) subjected to high salt stress by computing the correlation coefficient and principal components."

        "Title": "Desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated\nPleopeltis polypodioides\nfronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F\nt\n) and quantum yield (Q\ny\n) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Q\ny\nwhen exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.\nKeywords:\nheat stress, hydroperoxide, lipid hydroperoxide, antioxidative enzymes,\nPleopeltis polypodioides\n, fatty acids",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHeat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity (Wang et al., 2016). Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis (Kotak et al., 2007), changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis (Greer, 2015), protein synthesis (Ferguson et al., 1994), and membrane fluidity (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014). Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins (Chen et al., 2018) is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress (Wen et al., 2005;Mathur et al., 2014). Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (Fv), and maximum (Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000), which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2013;Awasthi et al., 2015). Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress (Lu et al., 2008;Ergin et al., 2016).Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress (Jiang and Huang, 2001;Rizhsky et al., 2002;Lipiec et al., 2013;Zandalinas et al., 2018) and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress (Rizhsky et al., 2002;Bhardwaj et al., 2015;Zandalinas et al., 2018). However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors.Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa (Gaff, 1997). They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes (Lange, 1955;Nörr, 1974;Meyer and Santarius, 1998) and lichens (Lange, 1953;Tegler and Kershaw, 1981). Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Kappen, 1964) and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Eickmeier, 1986) and angiosperms (Hambler, 1961;Kappen, 1966;Vieweg and Ziegler, 1969) was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation (Macfarlane and Kershaw, 1978;Tegler and Kershaw, 1981;Eickmeier, 1986). However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fernPleopletis polypodioidesin dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress.Pleopeltis polypodioides(aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration (Pessin, 1924;Stuart, 1968;John and Hasenstein, 2017). In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed (Pessin, 1924). Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation (Farrant et al., 1999;Helseth and Fischer, 2005). Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation (Pessin, 1924;Stuart, 1968;Helseth and Fischer, 2005;John and Hasenstein, 2017), and biochemical response to drought (Maslenkova and Homann, 2000;Georgieva and Maslenkova, 2001;Layton et al., 2010;John and Hasenstein, 2018) are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated.We evaluate the biochemical responses of dry and hydrated fronds of Pleopeltis to heat by assessing their photosynthetic and metabolic activities, levels of stress molecules, activities of antioxidative enzymes, membrane stability, and the fatty acid profile. Our results indicate that independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidative systems are sensitive to heat but dried fronds tolerate heat better than hydrated fronds."

        "Title": "Transcription profile of auxin related genes during positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature of Brassica rapa.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nUnlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of\nBrassica rapa\nand other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of\nPIN1\n,\nPIN3\n,\nIAA5\nand\nARG1\nin curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (\nUBQ1\n) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.\nKeywords:\nBrassica rapa\n, Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE), germination, gravitropism, hypocotyl, root",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionGravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls ofBrassica rapaand other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse [1]. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue.The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation [2] and is the main agent in complex processes that includes transport [3], and interaction with other phytohormones [4,5,6]. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity [7], cytoskeletal interaction [8,9], ions [10,11,12,13], and light [14,15,16,17,18]. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth [19,20], branching [21], and differentiation [22]. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression.Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices [23], developing seeds [24] and young leaves [25] and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model” [2]. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane [26]. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues [27].PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots [23] and is essential for efflux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells [28,29]. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells [30]; they direct the auxin flow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots [31], which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efflux towards the columella cells [32]. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots [33]. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin flow toward the cortical and epidermal cells [34,35]. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone [36].In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis [37,38], which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse [39,40,41]. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis [28] and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation [42]. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent [43] and a mutation in thePIN3gene affects differential growth [42]. Hence,PIN3is an important factor for shoot graviresponse [43]. ThePIN3homologsPIN4andPIN7are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse [43]. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse [44]. A mutation inARG1affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls [45] but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes [46]. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic [47], and gravitropic response [48] andPIN1mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) inArabidopsis thalianainflorescence axes [49]. Another Auxin Response Element promotesIAA5, a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes [50,51] that are governed by auxin [52].Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels ofPIN1,PIN3,IAA5andARGin vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls ofBrassica rapa. Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed [53] and used as a reference gene [54,55,56], its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes.Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression [57,58] during graviresponse [59], spatio-temporal differences in gene regulation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissue/region under consideration. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression profiles [60]. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal profile that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) [59,61], which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription profiles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature."

        "Title": "High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDirecting plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with\nBrassica rapa\nverified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.\nSubject terms:\nBiological techniques, Biophysics, Plant sciences",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe perception of the gravity stimulus and the involvement of amyloplasts have long been the focus of plant biology because of the cryptic nature of essential steps in the response of a biological system to physical stimuli such as gravity1–4. While the first step of the gravitropic response primarily depends on the interaction of intracellular particles with Earth’s gravitational field, the ability to respond to the gravity signal depends on biological conditions such as auxin sensitivity and transport5, time6,7, the cytoskeleton8and physical parameters such as temperature9, orientation10,11, osmotic conditions12, mechanical noise13, cytoplasmic viscosity14, and high-gradient magnetic fields15–17. The redundancy contributes to the stability of the graviresponse system and can integrate additional signals such as hydrotropism18,19and touch20,21. Because any physiological response is a function of the accumulated signal (auxin, altered gene expression, pH, ion, or charge shifts), control of the response shifts from the original signal to downstream events such as signal processing (translation) and response variables that are related to signal strength and persistence22.Therefore, the analysis of mechano-sensing and (gravi)response depends on the elimination of the gravity effects by experimenting under weightlessness conditions in space. The study of HGMF on amyloplast movements was attempted in ground studies15,23–26and was the focus of a shuttle experiment in 2003 (STS-107)27. However, the disintegration of the Shuttle during reentry made the intended analyses impossible. Nonetheless, this experiment provided strong evidence that mechano-sensitivity increased in microgravity27.Here we report data from a space experiment on the Space-X Crew Resupply Service 3 mission. The aim of this investigation was to repeat the ill-fated experiment on STS-107. However, instead of flax (Linum usitatissimum) we usedBrassica rapaseeds to study the effect of magnetic gradients and to take advantage of its Arabidopsis-related genome to assess transcriptional responses of genes related to growth, metabolism, auxin, and stress. Because of the dual effort to characterize the effect of HGMF and transcriptional analysis the remainder of the introduction covers separately each aspect.HGMFInduction of curvature by magneto-mechanical forces depends on the magnetic susceptibility (ϰ), which is characteristic of a given substance and describes its ability to acquire magnetization I as a result of the (inducing) magnetic field H such that I = ϰH. Diamagnetic substances have negative susceptibility and include the vast majority of biological substances. However, some metal-containing proteins such as hemoglobin, cytochrome, ferritin etc., can have positive susceptibility and are paramagnetic26,28,29. The magnetic susceptibility of dia- and paramagnetic compounds is proportional to their density and their behavior in a magnetic gradient is analogous to that in the gravity field16,24,26. Magnetic susceptibility and density of the cytoplasm are equal to that of water, ϰw= 7.2 × 10–7emu (electromagnetic units, table value), and that of starch ϰst= (8 ± 0.2) × 10–7, thus the differential susceptibility between starch and cytoplasm Δϰ ≈ 8 × 10–8emu. The density of starch ρst= 1.5 g/cm3, and cytoplasm ~ 1 g/cm3; therefore Δρ = 0.5 g/cm3and Δp/Δ ϰ ≈ − 6 × 106(g/cm3)/emu26.Although other methods of generating HGMF are available24,26, the generation of a magnetic gradient in the experiments described here, was realized by inserting into a uniform, strong magnetic field ferromagnetic wedges. The wedges become magnetized and create a HGMF (Fig.1) such that the gradient ∇H is directed toward the tip of the wedge. Therefore, the force acting on a diamagnetic body (ϰ < 0) repels starch-filled amyloplasts from the inserted object. In contrast, a para- or ferromagnetic body (ϰ > 0) would experience an attractive force. The force generated by the HGMF utilized in the employed setup has been determined previously to be about 0.6 g30and exceeds the acceleration that plants respond to (about 10–3g31).Figure 1.Open in a new tabThe design of the magnetic field chamber (MFC) with 10 magnets arranged in two stories with a total of eight compartments. The magnetic field was contained with two ferromagnetic yokes. Each compartment contained two ferromagnetic wedges and two pieces of activated charcoal cloth (ACC), and one seed cassette each. The diagram on the upper right shows the distortion of the magnetic field by the wedges (applicable to all compartments) and the projected growth of the seedling roots. The flow path of the fixative from a single fill port (F) to the drain port (D) is shown as white canals for front-visible paths; connections on the rear side between the individual compartments are shown as dark lines.In contrast to cultivation on earth where orienting factors are provided by gravity as constant and light as intermittent influence, plant growth in space cannot rely on gravitational clues; it depends on the plants’ (intermittent) phototropic response. However, in the absence of light, especially root elongation is variable, and orientation responds mostly to water gradients (hydrotropism)19,32. Removing the two most consequential vectors for plant orientation, i.e., growing plants under weightlessness conditions in the dark, provides an opportunity to examine the role of amyloplasts for directional growth analogous to their role in gravity sensing. Probing magnetophoretic effects and the space conditions on root growth was the objective for the experiment described here.The investigation included transcription analyses of 16 genes that represent auxin effects (IAA5, PIN 1, 3, 7) as the main growth regulator of differential elongation33–35, starch katabolism (Amy1)36, sucrose synthase (SUS,cell wall formation)37,UBQ1(ubiquitin1; a putative reference38and indicator of protein metabolism)39,TUB1(tubulin1; reference38, cell growth, mitosis),ACT7(actin7; putative reference40, root growth and germination41),ADH1(alcohol dehydrogenase; stress response42),COX(cytochrome oxidase subunit1; metabolism, stress43),G6PDH5(glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase5; oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, basic metabolism44),GLK(glucokinase; carbohydrate metabolism45) HXK (hexokinase 1; glucose metabolism and developmental regulator46),PFK(phosphofructokinase; carbohydrate metabolism, hypoxia stress47), andTAGL(triacylglycerol lipase; lipid metabolism48,49). The transcription pattern of these genes under conditions such as space (weightlessness), clinorotation (enhanced mechanostimulation), and static controls provided information on how seedlings respond to the respective conditions.This report describes an experiment that built on prior experience (i.e., Biotube1 on STS-107) but used genetically better-characterized plant material,Brassica rapa. Our data support HGMFs as suitable method to establish plant orientation in space but also show that mechanostimulation affects gravisensing-related metabolism. The report demonstrates that plants perceive weightlessness (“micro-gravity”) and respond by enhanced starch production in gravity perceiving cells."

The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.\nKeywords:\ncell membrane, clinorotation, microdomains, sterols",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionOur understanding of microgravity’s effects on living systems, including plants, improves as the result of better methods and novel technologies but also by using specific (plant) species. Examining increasingly complex interactions between specific plant responses and environmental conditions elucidates the complex effects of gravity on plants and their response to weightlessness. The realization that plants must be a component of Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) focused on plant productivity and the identification of the most suitable species for space cultivation [1,2]. Plant functionality during long-term space missions includes the responses to elevated CO2, the hydrolysis of water, oxygen generation, possibly hydrogen as generic fuel, and the recycling of water. However, the provision of edible biomass is certainly the most sought-after benefit of plant growth in space [3,4,5,6]. Human explorations of the Moon or Mars are impossible without BLSSs as the reduction in resources (water, food, and oxygen), achievable with BLSSs, is essential because of energy requirements for food transport, stowage, as well as the additional mass of packaging, which makes in situ food production and BLSSs essential for long-term space exploration. Additional criteria for in situ food production are logistical and space- and energy-saving measures. The degradation of food during long-term storage and the required volume can only be solved by means of preparing fresh food.The focus on BLSSs is different from fundamental biological questions of the effect of weightlessness on plant physiology. From the earliest to current space experiments, the effects of weightlessness were the focus of much basic research that included considerations of cellular structures, such as the organization of cells, responses of the cytoskeleton and metabolism, stress responses, and differential gene expressions between space experiments and ground controls [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16].Despite the fact that biological membranes, notably the cell membrane (CM), are most sensitive to altered gravity [17], there are few published data on the effect of microgravity on their physicochemical properties. The CM is one of the most dynamic supra-molecular structures in a cell, as it is the link between the cytoplasm and the extracellular matrix. It participates in numerous basic cell processes such as the transport of metabolites and ions, cell signaling, endocytosis, cell division and differentiation, and defense from pathogens [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The ability of plants to remodel membrane lipids and protein composition plays a crucial role in the adaptation to stress and environmental changes, including altering temperature, drought, salinity, and heavy metals [24].The involvement of CM in gravisensing has been demonstrated initially by the formation of complex and diverse pattern folds in the green alga Chlorella vulgaris in space flight in comparison with ground control [25]. The appearance of CM folds of a complicated configuration during space flight was suggested to associate with enhanced metabolism and endo- and exocytosis. Hanke [26] used planar lipid bilayers with alamethicin-induced pores to demonstrate the dependence of conductivity relative to the gravity vector. The influence of gravity has been confirmed in genuine biological membranes ofE. coli[27]. The gravity dependence of the viscosity of artificial and cell membranes was demonstrated during parabolic flights by means of fluorescence polarization microscopy [28]. Similarly, changes in the composition of phospholipids, fatty acids, and sterols in the CM of clinorotated pea seedlings have been reported [29,30,31] and prompted the hypothesis of gravitational decompensation, which postulates that the surface tension of the membrane under microgravity conditions can induce changes that are enhanced by the heterogeneity of the membrane. Thus, alteration in the physicochemical properties of the membrane leads to changes in the permeability and ion transport activity of membrane-bound channels, followed by adjustments of metabolism and eventually physiological responses [32].The presence of functional microdomains with specific localization and lipids and protein composition in the CM became known as “membrane microdomains” or “detergent-resistant membranes” (DRMs). However, the most common name is “lipid rafts” with the distinction of rafts, clustered rafts, DRMPs, and Caveolae [33]. The formation of ordered domains was linked to the behavior of DRMs in liposomes and cells [34]. Upon stimulation, rafts may cluster to form larger structures, i.e., temporally and spatially organize functionally different protein complexes, that improve the synchronization and specificity of cellular responses [33]. The functional significance of lipid rafts, their dynamic assembly, and the enrichment of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated fatty acids affect membrane trafficking and signaling. Thus, lipid rafts take part in many vitally important cell processes [20,23,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. The concept of cholesterol clustering helps explain its effect on membrane fluidity via the formation of ordered domains and changed membrane deformation by altered protein interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton, and the formation and stabilization of lipid–protein assemblies [43]. The main function of sphingolipids is their involvement in signal transmission from the outer to the inner membrane surface. This function depends on various lipophilic (ceramide) or hydrophilic (carbohydrate) attachments, which determine the extent of the interaction of the lipid bilayer with the polar environment. Sphingolipids are localized on the outer membrane surface, and the specificity is determined by the attached carbohydrate moiety [44,45,46]. Lipid rafts explain the biochemical processes of the cell membrane under normal and stress conditions that cannot be explained otherwise. The increased cholesterol and saturated fatty acid content of the raft fraction in clinorotated pea seedling root membranes indicated raft sensitivity to clinorotation [47].The aim of this review is to assess available data on plant lipid rafts as possible triggers of changes in cell activities in response to changes in mechanical stimulation and unloading."

        "Title": "Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLike many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of\nArabidopsis thaliana\nhave been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in\nXenopus laevis\noocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins.",

        "Title": "United in Diversity: Mechanosensitive Ion Channels in Plants",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSomatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.\nResearch organism:\nMouse",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPain is a complex sensation. It serves to protect organisms from harmful stimuli, but can also become chronic and debilitating following tissue injury and disease. Distinct cells and molecules detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Thermal pain is detected by thermosensitive TRP channels in subsets of nociceptors (Caterina et al., 2000;Vriens et al., 2011), and gentle touch is detected by Piezo2 channels in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) (Ranade et al., 2014;Woo et al., 2014). Aδ high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) have been shown to play a key role in responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Arcourt et al., 2017;Ghitani et al., 2017).Recent studies have shown that there are at least two populations of HTMRs that mediate responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. TheNpy2r+subpopulation of HTMRs mediates fast paw withdrawal responses to pinprick stimulation and terminates as free nerve endings in the epidermis (Arcourt et al., 2017). TheCalca+subpopulation of circumferential-HTMRs responds to noxious force and hair pulling, and terminates as circumferential endings wrapped around guard hair follicles (Ghitani et al., 2017). Additionally, somatostatin-expressing interneurons of laminae I-III in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receive input from nociceptors and are required for behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Duan et al., 2014). Despite these advances in defining the cells and circuits of mechanical pain, little is known about the molecular signaling pathways in mechanonociceptors.Here, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is required for mechanical pain sensation. S1P is a bioactive lipid that signals via 5 G-protein coupled S1P Receptors (S1PRs 1–5). S1P signaling, mainly via S1PR1, plays a well-known role in immune cell migration and maturation (Spiegel and Milstien, 2003;Matloubian et al., 2004;Schwab et al., 2005). Additionally, recent studies have shown that S1PRs are expressed throughout the nervous system (Janes et al., 2014;Mair et al., 2011;Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and S1P signaling is associated with a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., 2010) and Alzheimer’s disease (Couttas et al., 2014). S1P has been implicated in spontaneous pain (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and thermal pain hypersensitivity (Mair et al., 2011;Finley et al., 2013;Weth et al., 2015), but due to conflicting accounts of S1P receptor expression in the CNS (Janes et al., 2014;Weth-Malsch et al., 2016) and PNS (Mair et al., 2011;Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013;Usoskin et al., 2015) as well as inconsistent reports on the effects of S1P on neuronal excitability (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2006;Li et al., 2015) and pain behaviors (Mair et al., 2011;Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013;Finley et al., 2013;Weth et al., 2015), the role of S1P in somatosensation remains controversial.We found that mice lacking the S1P receptor S1PR3 display striking and selective deficits in behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Likewise, peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signaling or S1P production impairs mechanical sensitivity. We show that S1P constitutively enhances the excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via closure of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels to tune mechanical pain sensitivity. The effects of S1P are completely dependent on S1PR3. While previous studies have shown that elevated S1P triggers acute pain and injury-evoked thermal sensitization (Mair et al., 2011;Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), we now demonstrate that baseline levels of S1P are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, elevated S1P selectively triggers thermal sensitization via activation of TRPV1+heat nociceptors, with no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings uncover an essential role for constitutive S1P signaling in mechanical pain."

        "Introduction": "1 IntroductionOocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) have been used for several decades for the expression of transporters and receptors from bacteria [1], plants [2,3], and mammals [4–6] due to the simplicity and reliability of this experimental system [7]. Relatively low background ion channel activity [8], large size (1–1.5 mm), low cost, and ease of handling make these cells a favored system for the expression of human, plant and bacterial channels. Xenopus oocytes have also been used as a model system for the study of processes unrelated to ion transport such as apoptosis [9,10], gene expression [11], the structure and function of the nuclear envelope [12] and many others [13].While most mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) have been characterized under native conditions [14–16], we have recently expressed and characterized two MSCs in Xenopus oocytes, MscS fromEscherichia coliand MSL10 fromArabidopsis thaliana[17,18]. Our analyses were made possible by previous studies showing that the endogenous MSCs known to be present in the oocyte membrane [8,19,20] can be effectively blocked or inactivated [21,22]. A number of useful papers on frog maintenance [23], oocyte expression and transport systems [3,24–28], oocyte isolation, and the methods used for characterization of ligand- and voltage-gated channels in the Xenopus oocyte system [29–33] have been published to date. Here we focus on the methods we used for the heterologous expression and characterization of MscS and MSL10 at the single-channel level. We describe in detail the techniques for surgery, oocyte isolation and preparation, in vitro RNA production and injection into oocytes, and basics of MSC electrophysiology, including patch-clamp and pressure-clamp."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load normally imposed by the Earth’s gravitational field on the inner ear utricular epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as “within-specimen” controls, whereas utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. These data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments.\nNEW & NOTEWORTHY\nSpaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAims:\nTo determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors—as a function of clinorotation speed—using time-lapse microscopy.\nBackground:\nGround-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).\nMethods:\nWe compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients.\nResults:\nAmong clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (\nP\n<0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control (\nP\n=0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility.\nConclusions:\nThese results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIntricate multi-scale interactions among cells, tissues, and organs fundamentally govern human health, which has evolved on Earth under a constant gravitational load of 1 g (9.8 m/s2). The biological mechanisms underlying the role of gravity in human health remain poorly understood, but their elucidation is necessary for enabling long-term manned space exploration. Numerous studies, supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other space agencies, have shown deleterious effects of space travel on the human body, such as accelerated bone loss,1,2muscle tissue degeneration,3and others.4Importantly, these observations may have broader implications beyond spaceflight applications to provide a more detailed understanding of diseases on Earth. In particular, the musculoskeletal system has historically been a focal point in space biology research, because of the strikingly adverse changes that occur in astronauts.5More recently, studies have begun to investigate mesenchymal stem cells for their roles in musculoskeletal lineage determination,6bone repair,7and tissue maintenance.8Although the most relevant environment for performing microgravity research is in space, competition to use space-based facilities, like the International Space Station, is fierce and is further complicated by substantial time and resource investments.9As a result, lower-cost and logistically simpler alternatives are attractive and include sounding rockets10and parabolic flights,11or in-lab devices such as random positioning machines12and clinorotation devices (clinostats)13to simulate microgravity. The selection of a specific technique usually depends on accessibility, cost, experimental design, and research question. Clinostats are among the most accessible methods to simulate microgravity, and they allow researchers to study living cells using standard laboratory tissue culture supplies.14Clinorotation experiments have provided significant insight into the behavior of biological organisms in space. The technique was originally developed to study gravitropism in plant development, and has revealed that gravity serves a key role in statocyte function, which is believed to be directly involved in plant gravisensing and growth patterns.15In animal and human cells, clinorotation has been used to recreate experiments that would otherwise be challenging to perform in space, such as high-resolution microscopy16and assessment of stem cell differentiation.17Cellular changes in microgravity have been associated with disruptions in the cytoskeleton and, consequently, changes in cell morphology and behavior.18,19Although clinorotation is a standard ground-based tool, previously reported studies on the effects of simulated microgravity in mesenchymal stem cells have yielded conflicting findings (Table 1). For instance, some researchers have shown that microgravity enhances proliferation,17whereas others have demonstrated inhibition.20Chondrogenic differentiation has also been found to be either promoted21or suppressed.22Similar inconsistencies have also been highlighted in a recent review.23Some of these observed discrepancies could be due to differences in culture media formulation and cell source, but it is also possible that the choice of clinorotation parameters used for an experiment may substantially influence cell behavior.Table 1.

Theoretically speaking, to simulate microgravity effectively, the period of rotation should be shorter than some time constant that governs the rate processes involved in the cellular gravisensing machinery that enable a cell to ‘perceive’ and respond to the changing trajectory of the gravity vector. For conventional clinostats, however, there are also practical considerations that limit the angular frequency of rotation.24Specifically, rotation speed must be adjusted to balance sedimentation forces, centrifugal and Coriolis effects, and Stokes’ drag. Because of these constraints, the parameters of angular rotation depend on the particular design and implementation of each experimental system.To minimize the effects of these extrinsic stimuli, we recently developed a lab-on-chip clinorotation device (clinochip,Figure 1a) that confines adhered cells within a small region along the axis of rotation, limiting residual accelerations to levels below 10−4g at different rotation speeds.25Moreover, the clinochip is amenable to time-lapse microscopy, which enables us to characterize the kinetics of cell spreading, changes in morphology, and migration with minimal disruption to the simulated microgravity environment. In this study, we used this device to investigate how angular frequency affects human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) behavior. On the basis of the concept that there are specific rate processes that govern cellular gravisensing (Figure 1b), we hypothesize that hMSCs would exhibit angular frequency-dependent responses. The results of this work demonstrate that hMSCs can in fact ‘detect’ differences in rotation speed in a manner that causes heterogeneous population shifts toward more rounded morphologies and retraction of cell area. This could have significant implications on our basic understanding of stem cell regulation as well as on strategies that are being used in stem cell-based applications.Figure 1.Open in a new tabFramework of how perceived gravity may bias cellular events under clinorotation. (a) The clinochip system consists of a stationary non-rotated control chip and a rotating clinochip, the speed of which can be controlled.

Lightly shaded blocks illustrate hypothetical time constants required for various intrinsic cellular events to occur.

Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone.\nMaterials and methods\nThe regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization.\nResults\nFibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E\n2\n(PGE\n2\n).

In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated with growth.\nConclusions\nThe ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe mechanisms that regulate bone growth and mineralization remain poorly understood. The cellular events involved in bone formation include chemotaxis of osteoblast precursors, growth factor (GF) production, proliferation of committed osteoblast precursors, and the differentiation (mineralization) of osteoblasts. Bone formation requires expression of structural proteins such as collagen type I, osteocalcin, noggin and runx2 during mineralization [1]. Numerous studies suggest that a variety of growth factors such as FGF-2, TGFβ, IGF-1, PDGF and PGE2act as autocrine and paracrine hormones to regulate bone cell proliferation [2]. FGF-2 is an important modulator of bone formationin vitroandin vivo[3,4]. FGF-2 is tightly bound to the bone matrix and can be extracted as a biologically active GF [5] and is thought to play a major role in wound healing [6,7].To evaluate the physiological activity of FGF-2 and other growth factors, we studied their relative ability to influence proliferation of osteoblasts at a site of injury in a mineralized culture. MC3T3-E1 is a cloned mouse osteoblast-like cell line that retains synthetic functions of bone. When treated with differentiation media, these cultured osteoblasts have the ability to differentiate, including synthesis of alkaline phosphatase [8], type I collagen [9], osteocalcin [10,11] and mineralized matrix containing hydroxyapatite crystals [12].We have previously reported that FGF-2 is induced by mechanical stress [13,14] and causes proliferation after mechanical stress. FGF-2 is an immediate-early gene that is regulated by both PKA and MAPK signal transduction pathways [15]. Here we report that FGF-2 induces expression of growth-related genes and down-regulates genes responsible for differentiation and mineralization. In addition, BMP-2 is considerably more effective than FGF-2 in inducing new mineralization."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionProstate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009 [1]. However, the natural history of this disease is remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood. In the United States, 90% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of local/regional stage [1], and the majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level only [2]. Evidence suggests that a fair proportion of early stage low-grade tumors detected by PSA screening may be over-diagnosed “latent” cancers, and that patients could have equally good survival without immediate treatment, and avoid or delay morbidity associated with treatment [3].Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary management strategies for early stage prostate cancer; however, both options are associated with decreases in urinary and sexual function [4]. Active surveillance (AS) (also called “delayed treatment”) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low-grade disease (“low burden” disease). AS involves close monitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid definitive treatment and the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interventions are offered at early signs of progression. Although data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are ongoing, some [3,5] but not all [6] observational reports of populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indicate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatment immediately, although further research with longer follow-up is needed [7].Our collaborative group established a program for men with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention research [8–10]. Observational epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer progression. We previously reported that greater intakes of fish and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence/progression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors [11]. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory actions [12] and influence the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis [13–17] that has been implicated in prostate cancer [18]. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that may have anti-inflammatory protective effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhibition ofCOX-2[11,19–23]. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and fish oil supplements would beneficially affect gene expression in putative cancer-related pathways (IGF-1,IGF-1R, andCOX-2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS."

Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.\nKeywords:\nAlveolar type II epithelial cells, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Differentiation, Invariant natural killer T cells, Ferroptosis",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease characterized by immature lung development that affects almost half of extremely preterm infants [1]. Decreased alveolar number, simplified alveolar structure, and accompanying vascular lesions are features of BPD [2]. Hyperoxia can induce BPD phenotype and change the composition of cellular compartments [3]. Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) are the main stem cells of the lung and maintain normal lung function [4]. When the lung is damaged, AEC II have a role in replacing abnormal and damaged alveolar epithelial cells [5]. In particular, the abnormal ability of AEC II to proliferate and differentiate into AEC I is an important factor leading to this disease [6,7]. More and more evidence has shown that in addition to direct AEC II injury, other cell programmed cell death (PCD) including apoptosis [8], pyroptosis [9], autophagy [10] and ferroptosis [11] plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD and the further development of the disease [12]. Studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cell deaths are associated with lung injury, affecting alveolar development and participates in the pathological process of BPD [12]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the potential pathogenesis of AEC II in BPD for the development and treatment of BPD.At present, many studies have focused on the regulation of the immune microenvironment during lung development and disease [13]. The pathogenesis of BPD also includes changes in the proportion of immune cells [9]. In recent years, studies have mainly focused on the role of immune cells and immune responses in the pathogenesis of BPD, but the mechanism and role of different immune cells in BPD still unclear. Several recent discoveries have been made regarding how a particular subset of Natural killer T (NKT) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, play a key role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lung [14] and liver diseases [15], iNKT cells activation is considered to be an important upstream event that promotes chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis [15,16]. iNKT cells are considered as a kind of innate T lymphocyte population, which are lymphocytes with the characteristics of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells, and serve as a bridge connecting the two immune responses, which can initiate or inhibit immune responses depending on the environment, account for the majority of NKT cells [17]. iNKT cells are tissue-resident and play an important role in tissue homeostasis and immunity in lung tissues, they patrol the lumen of pulmonary vascular and interstitial tissue until lung tissue becomes infected and signals danger, causing iNKT cells migrate to damaged sites containing glycolipid antigens and inducing iNKT cells to initiate early host defense mechanisms, preferentially locating in lung parenchyma [18].The percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was higher than that of other lymphocytes in the lung [19]. Previous studies have shown that the number and function of iNKT cells are different in different lung diseases [14]. Pulmonary iNKT cells are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including direct pathogenic effects through their cytokine secretion, or more indirectly by regulating the function of neighboring immune cells [14]. In particular, cytokine production by iNKT cells has been implicated in many lung diseases, including allergic asthma [20], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [21], pulmonary fibrosis [16], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [22], and others. iNKT cells are adaptive immune cells with innate functions that have been shown to play a role in the neonatal immune response, where they can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines or lipid antigens and trigger further cytokine production and activation by other immune cell populations [23]. It has been shown that iNKT cells play an important role in the neonatal response to sepsis, and loss of iNKT cells leads to improved survival in neonatal septic mice [24]. iNKT cells are involved in the deterioration of lung disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in neonatal mice [25]. Therefore, it may be particularly valuable to further investigate the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in respiratory diseases, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets. However, the role of iNKT cells in BPD remains unclear.IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cells development, maturation, and survival [26]. In this study, we first downloaded microarray data from GEO database to analyze the peripheral blood IL-15 expression in BPD patients, and clinically examined peripheral blood NKT cells changes in BPD patients. Secondly, a mouse model of BPD was established by hyperoxia to investigate the effect of iNKT cells in lung tissue on lung differentiation. Finally, iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system were established in vitro under hyperoxia. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on AEC II under different incubation conditions to investigate the possible mechanisms by which iNKT cells affect AEC II."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThree-dimensional (3D) cell culture is critical for understanding the function of cells in a physiologically relevant context and for tissue engineering complex solid organs like the liver [1]. 3D culture of hepatocytes has been shown to maintain the differentiated functions of hepatic cell lines [2] and primary cells [3,4] as well as promote differentiation of stem cells toward the hepatic lineage [5–8]. Sustained differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture could be harnessed for drug toxicity screening [9,10] or to improve the efficacy of extracorporeal liver-assist devices [11]. In addition, 3D aggregation may facilitate transplantation of hepatocytes kept in culture, which would be particularly useful for hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells [12,13].While differentiated functions are improved in hepatocytes cultured either on 3D scaffolds [14–17] or as self-aggregated 3D spheroids [2–4], little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to those improved functions in 3D culture. Using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system, we previously showed that one important factor for sustaining differentiated functions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is sustained 3D cell-cell interactions [2]. RWVs are rotational bioreactors with a gas permeable membrane that, when in operation, are completely filled with culture media so that it functionally rotates as a solid-body around a horizontal axis. This creates a suspension culture environment with minimal fluid shear stress and turbulence, allowing cells to co-localize and self-aggregate with 3D spatial freedom [18]. Studies have shown that hepatocyte spheroids cultured under these conditions could develop into larger sizes with less hypoxic limitations to the inner core compared to stationary culture [19]. Human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells co-cultured within RWVs demonstrated formation of complex 3D micro-architectures, including microvilli, bile canaliculi, and sinusoidal fenestrations [20,21].Importantly, as tissue engineering strategies advance and the definitions of biomaterials evolve, self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids developed within bioreactors may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22]. Self-aggregated cellular spheroids are the building blocks for organ printing, a bottom up synthesis approach to tissue engineering [23]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte functions within 3D spheroids is critical for the optimization of organ function within a printed liver. Moreover, hepatocyte spheroids generated within RWVs allow investigation of the biological effects of 3D cell-cell interactions without the influence of contacting scaffolds, surfaces, or carriers. In this study, we performed global gene expression and promoter region analyses on primary mouse hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or RWVs to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAltered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (\nn\n= 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant (\nP\n< 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples.\nEGR3\n,\nFASLG, BTG2, SPRY2,\nand\nTAGAP\nare biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThis article is based on a lecture I presented as the recipient of the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Lecturer Award at the Biomedical Engineering Society annual meeting in October 2009. Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\nKeywords:\nMechanotransduction, Tensegrity, Cell mechanics, Prestress, Cytoskeleton, Integrin, Biomimetic",

        "Title": "Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew’s skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAn increased focus on the relationship between indoor buildings and human health has led to a recognition that the International Space Station (ISS) is particularly well suited for studying microbiome within structures because the orbiting outpost is a uniquely isolated “island” in space [1]. Onboard the ISS, investigators can systematically track microbial arrival, circulation, and transmission—unlike other settings used for studying microbiology of built environments, such as homes [2], hospitals [3], submarines [4], subways [5], aircraft [6], or remote scientific stations [7]. Moreover, the influx and outflow of microorganisms at the ISS generally occurs at preplanned intervals when crewmembers, cargo, and experiments are exchanged between transport spacecraft. For these reasons, the ISS is an unparalleled location for studying the interactive dynamics between humans and microorganisms inside closed habitats. Comparatively, terrestrial efforts to monitor microbial dynamics in buildings must address a variety of confounding study factors (e.g., ventilation, human occupants, environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity).Remarkably, up to 40% of microbial signatures inside terrestrial buildings are derived from humans living or visiting the space [8], due to microbial debris associated with shedding, exhalation, expectoration, skin shedding, cuts in the skin, bladder and bowel waste [9]. Hospodsky et al. [10] estimated that every hour approximately 10 million bacteria or fungi can be released inside a built environment by a single human occupant. People with uncompromised respiratory tract and healthy immune systems can usually fight off potentially harmful microbes residing within built habitats. However, human spaceflight introduces new risks that must be considered because astronauts can become more susceptible to infections during long spaceflight missions [11]. The beneficial, benign or detrimental pathways associated with microbe-host interactions in spaceflight remain poorly understood [12,13]. Notably, recent ISS surveys of habitable surface, air, and water samples observed novel species, some of which might have become more abundant due to space-unique stressors including microgravity and solar/cosmic radiation [14–16]. It was also recently shown thatZinniaplants that were grown on the VEGGIE system on the ISS, had succumbed to wilt and rot disease due to a fungal pathogen,Fusarium oxysporum[17]. The plant pathogen was also isolated from surface wipes from the Microbial Tracking -1 study [18]. Numerous spaceflight experiments testingBacillus subtilis,Bacillus pumilus,Escherichia coli, andSalmonella typhimuriumreported mutations and a subset of differentially expressed genes associated, or not associated with virulence [19–24]. Taken together, the previous body of ISS microbiology research highlights many unknowns that can only be addressed with more systematic, spatiotemporal measurements directly correlated to ISS occupants. Collecting and interpreting microbial profiling data onboard will be crucial for future mission plans (i.e., traveling to the Moon or Mars) where rapid crew return and Earth-based medical interventions seem unlikely.Recently, ISS surface samples from several locations were acquired and microbial diversity profiles were documented utilizing shotgun metagenome [25] and amplicon (bacteria and fungi) sequencing [26]. These investigations revealed a previously unmonitored richness of microbial diversity inside the ISS [25,27]. One study has, for the first time, examined correlations between resident astronauts and the ISS surface microbiomes using 16S rRNA sequencing, and found that surface microbiome shares similarities to the skin microbiome [28]. The study also presented evidence that the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and tongue change during the space mission. Recently, one astronaut was monitored for a 1-year spaceflight study, and the gastrointestinal microbiomes pre-, during and post-flight were analyzed and compared to a control subject on earth [29]. There were no significant differences between the two subjects in the overall microbial diversity, though the richness of the astronaut’s microbiome was lower than his control subject. Within the astronaut samples, there did not appear to be any significant decreases in richness or diversity in inflight samples relative to pre-flight and post-flight samples.Motivated by a predecessor Microbial Tracking-1 project described by Singh et al. [25] and Checinska-Sielaff et al. [26], and the need for more comprehensive and metagenomic sequencing analysis of crew and environmental microbiome (including bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses), we conducted a study called Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) that aimed to measure the relationship between environmental microorganisms and astronauts in spaceflight which could be insightful for future mission planners assessing threats or benefits to astronaut health (i.e., commensal, mutualistic, and pathogenic relationships). To achieve these objectives, eight defined ISS surface locations were sampled two times over the course of six months from 2017 to 2018, DNA extracted, and microbial diversity were catalogued using shotgun metagenome sequencing. Alongside these environmental surface samples, skin, ear, mouth, nostril and saliva samples provided by a crewmember (pre-flight, inflight, and post-flight) were collected to identify trends in temporal and spatial dynamics. Analyses with data collected from additional crewmembers will be needed to rigorously test identified trends. The overarching hypothesis for MT-2 was that the arrival, 6-month stay, and departure of a crewmember to the ISS could be sensed via an increase or perturbation of microbial similarity between crewmember body sites and various habitat surfaces. A related objective for MT-2 was to determine if the astronaut microbiome would inherit microbiome from the ISS and if those taxa would be retained months after returning from the mission."

Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing.

Past studies have reported microorganisms co-transported with globally-dispersed aerosols, and that both DNA signatures and viable cells can be detected in air masses2–4. For example, thousands of taxonomic signatures were measured in springtime Asian dust plumes delivering free tropospheric bioaerosols to an alpine research station in central Oregon3. In a separate flight project surveying airborne microorganisms in the western region of the United States, several taxa were found to be enriched in the upper atmosphere, including bacterial familiesLachnospiraceae,RuminococcaceaeandErysipelotrichaceae2. Despite harsh conditions in the atmosphere, viable bacterial isolates were recovered from the same study2, includingBacillussp.,Micrococcussp.,Arthrobactersp. andStaphylococcussp.Previous aerobiology campaigns using aircraft were flown at single altitudes in order to refine collection methods and demonstrate some of the first measurements of an atmospheric microbiome2,5–7. To date, there are only a few studies that have examined microbiological changes across a vertical gradient in Earth’s troposphere8–10. More studies using advanced genomic techniques such as shotgun metagenomic sequencing will be essential to formulating predictive models of bioaerosols and how the atmospheric microbiome is influenced by meteorological conditions11,12. High-altitude aircraft can be used to travel at variable altitudes in the atmosphere, allowing us to investigate how bioaerosols patterns change with height above the surface. Herein, we report microbial composition in a “staircase pattern” flown at 10,000 ft, 20,000 ft, 30,000 ft and 40,000 ft using an Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) device onboard NASA’s C-20A aircraft2. Air samples were collected on two consecutive flight days (June 20–21, 2018) in the vicinity of Palmdale, CA, USA, across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Following each flight, captured bioaerosols were analyzed with traditional culture-based methods as well as metagenomic DNA sequencing. A meteorological and atmospheric dispersion computer model was then applied to the microbiological dataset to provide predictions of bioaerosol measurement signals and potential population exposures in downwind regions."

The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months.\nMethods\nEight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.\nResults\nStaphylococcus\nsp. and\nMalassezia\nsp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10\n5\ncfu/m\n2\nConclusions\nUtilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome.

The composition of built environments is largely influenced by its occupants [1–4] but can also be affected by external features such as seasonal variations [5,6], architectural design [7], and level of urbanization [8]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health.For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [9]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [10]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [11–13]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [14]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [15,16].Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [17]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [18–20], surfaces [21,22], and water [23]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [24] and pathogens [25] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members.The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [26] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated."

        "Title": "Detection of Target Genes for Drug Repurposing to Treat Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Mice Flown in Spaceflight",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSkeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article investigates multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks via link prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy. Key target genes that cause muscle atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are detected using graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic datasets collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease knowledge graph was constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. We computed node embeddings, random walk measures from the networks. Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs selected for repurposing using the graph convolution network method were nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and others related to insulin.\nKeywords:\nmachine learning, skeletal muscle atrophy, graph convolutional neural networks, graph neural network, random forest, gradient boosting method, knowledge graphs, node embeddings, random walk, diseases, drugs, link prediction",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight experiments using mice are being conducted to determine the impact of microgravity on different muscle groups [1]. A major health problem in spaceflight is muscle wastage due to microgravity. The primary muscles in the human body are the muscles of the upper limb and lower limb. Experiments on hind limb muscle wasting after a 13-day shuttle flight have shown reduced knee weight bearing and meniscal degradation, inducing an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci [2]. Changes in electrical impedance characteristics in gastrocnemius muscles are also induced by spaceflight [3]. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a secondary effect of aging (sarcopenia) and diseases such as diabetes, cancer and kidney diseases. The primary muscles in the human body are the upper limb and lower limb. Studies have shown that muscle gene expression is different in spaceflight vs. that on the ground. Models of sarcopenia and age-related muscle loss have been studied in [4]. Spaceflight induces similar muscle loss, and the analysis of their gene expression (see [5]) has revealed that a majority of 272 mRNAs that were significantly altered by spaceflight displayed similar responses to hind limb suspension.There are several molecular processes that influence muscle atrophy. The muscle RING-finger protein-1 that plays an important role in muscle remodeling is an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues [6]. Spaceflight induces unique muscle atrophy in animal models. The MuRF1 nullified mice did not show improvement in soleus muscle loss, showing that atrophy proceeds under unique mechanisms in spaceflight [7]. Muscle mass is a balance between protein generation and degradation. A decreased rate of synthesis causes skeletal muscle wasting. The ubiquitin proteosome is the protein synthesis pathway in muscle atrophy. It has been shown that proteosome inhibition reduces denervation-induced muscle atrophy [8]. One of the most important muscle-wasting cytokines is tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), elevated levels of which cause significant muscular abnormalities. Although there has been some advancement in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms such as MuRF1/MAFbx/FOXO pathways and potential triggers behind muscle disuse, there is a significant gap in knowledge in the regulatory mechanism of the associated genes and their functional significance. It is known that anabolic and catabolic pathways regulate muscle atrophy in adult organisms. Deacetylase inhibitors represent a prototype of epigenetic drugs that have been proposed as a possible intervention that targets multiple signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of muscle atrophy. Niclosamide has also been proposed to regulate myogenesis and catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle.Apart from microgravity, radiation exposure in spaceflight has been reported to aggravate atrophic processes in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, which is induced already by spaceflight. Radiation was shown to inhibit the reparative processes [9]. Oxidative stress is increased by higher levels of radiation. The upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counters cellular damage due to radiation which can be artificially induced [10]. Several countermeasures have been proposed for alleviating muscle wastage in spaceflight. Exercise countermeasures do not alleviate the reduction in muscle function or muscle size due to the unloading effects of spaceflight [11]. While exercise countermeasures seem insufficient for maintaining muscle function in long deep space measures, it is important to find effective countermeasures for long duration spaceflights. Bone loss is preserved and tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle changes are eliminated by countermeasures such as bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL therapies (Denosaumab and OPG-Fc) and treatment of young mice with REGN1033 (a monoclonal antibody against myostatin) [12]. With future space missions, finding effective countermeasures for muscle atrophy in spaceflight has gained paramount importance. Simulated microgravity, use of animal models, applications of countermeasures, studies of interrelationships between bone and muscle tissues, and studies on the effect of radiation on skeletal muscles are necessary for human exploration of space [13]. In our earlier paper on drug repurposing [14], we applied three Machine Learning (ML) methods for identifying drugs for treatment of organ muscle atrophy. In this paper, we have added the Pearson correlation method for identification of key gene regulators of skeletal muscle atrophy, and also have implemented Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) for link prediction. GCN results for identification of repurposable drugs for skeletal muscle atrophy is compared with the GNN method reported as the best method in [14]. NASA’s GeneLab [15] datasets are collected in spaceflight under microgravity and low radiations doses in low Earth orbit. The radiation details of these datasets are provided in [16].Section 2presents the GeneLab datasets and ML methods used to identify key diseases associated with skeletal muscle atrophy and drugs for repurposing.Section 3presents the results of the ML algorithms for link predictions in the constructed Gene Disease Knowledge Graph (GDKG) and Disease Drug Knowledge Graph (DDKG).Section 4discusses the key genes and repurposable drugs selected by link prediction, andSection 5presents the conclusions."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA detailed understanding of how spaceflight affects human health is essential for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.\nSubject terms:\nTranscriptomics, Energy metabolism, Calcium and vitamin D",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionA detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration1. Without effective solutions for aerospace health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel. Solid biopsies have traditionally served as the gold standard for molecular monitoring of human physiology, but such invasive procedures require specialized equipment and carry an increased risk of infection and regional pain. To circumvent these difficulties, researchers on Earth have started to use blood or fluid samples, which are simpler to perform and require little to no recovery time, allowing for increased temporal resolution of sampling. These minimally invasive “liquid biopsies” permit the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids2,3, which are thought to detect changes earlier than conventional protein biomarkers4and to better resolve molecular heterogeneity than standard tissue biopsies5. Cell-free nucleic acids have emerged as potential space-relevant biomarkers of psychosocial and physical stress6, aging7, metabolic disorders8, and inflammation9, and have already been successfully utilized in various terrestrial healthcare contexts, including screening for infections10, diagnosing cancer11, and monitoring cancer recurrence and therapy12. On a similar note, cell-free nucleic acids can infer well-documented spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage13,14, in distal tissues without the need for invasive tissue biopsies15, which would be particularly difficult to conduct in orbit.Longitudinal and full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. This approach may grant a detailed understanding of how the human body responds to the space environment and the development of modern countermeasures. Consenting astronauts could participate in lifetime surveillance through annual liquid biopsies, which could reveal the degree of full recovery from spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the latter of which causes increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease and blood cancers16,17. Liquid biopsies may be particularly constructive during interplanetary spaceflight missions, in which orbital healthcare autonomy will need to be optimized due to the large distance away from Earth. With the advent of the portable, nanopore-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, nucleic acids could potentially be extracted and directly sequenced in-flight by crew to monitor their own health in near real time18–20.The NASA Twins Study provided a unique opportunity to perform a multi-omics analysis with monozygotic twin astronauts, where one participant resided on the ISS for 340 days, and the other remained on Earth16. The past few years have now welcomed the first studies to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in astronauts, using data from the NASA Twins Study21and data collected 20 years prior with 14 astronauts on short-term missions22. These studies highlighted a theme of mitochondrial stress as a consistent spaceflight phenotype23, with bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealing mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) spikes during flight, the levels of which were correlated to time spent on the ISS24, and plasma analysis revealing cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) spikes during flight21and in the immediate days after return22.Here, we report an independent study with six astronaut participants, where we examined plasma cfRNA profiles that reflect the longitudinal responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. To disentangle microgravity from the various factors of the spaceflight environment, we directly compared our human plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a published JAXA spaceflight mission that incorporated an artificial gravity device installed on the Japanese ISS Kibo Experiment Module25. Through this process, minimally invasive approaches were used in both species to gain a comprehensive overview of conserved environmental responses to microgravity, with increased mitochondrial components in plasma being one such prominent response."

        "Title": "Increasing the number of unloading/reambulation cycles does not adversely impac body composition and lumbar bone mineral density but reduces tissue sensitivity",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls.\nIn vivo\nµCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2\nnd\nor 3\nrd\nHLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.\nKeywords:\nadipose tissue, muscle, bone, hindlimb unloading, reambulation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionExposure to microgravity can profoundly alter body mass, body composition, and function of the musculoskeletal system [1,2]. While body and muscle mass may return to normal values within several months upon return weight-bearing [1], weight-bearing bones may not recover even years after returning to normal ambulatory activities [3]. Because of the limited number of space-missions and the invasive nature of many assays, many studies have turned to the well-established rodent hindlimb unloading model (HLU) to investigate the mechanisms by which a single unloading period causes atrophy [4]. However, the impact of repeated exposures to microgravity on many physiologic systems, including the musculoskeleton and body composition, is largely unknown.Decreases in body mass during spaceflight, bedrest, and HLU may occur via losses in adipose and/or lean tissue, and have been attributed to many factors such as decreased caloric intake, dehydration, as well as increased (HLU) or decreased energy expenditure (bedrest) [1,5–8]. During hindlimb unloading, body mass and serum leptin levels, linking energy metabolism to bone mass, can diminish even when caloric intake is adequate [9]. Importantly, after 28 days of HLU, the change in bone formation rates was significantly correlated with the change in serum leptin levels [9]. However, the loss of functional weightbearing also alters the mechanical milieu of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the pluripotent precursors to numerous cell types including osteoblasts and adipocytes [10–12], which may bias the differentiation of MSCs from an osteogenic to an adipogenic lineage. Whether unloading-induced changes in MSC differentiation result in increased abdominal adipose tissue is not well understood.Further, abdominal adipose tissue is distributed as either subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) or visceral adipose tissue (VAT). While abdominal adipose tissue in general is associated with obesity-related health problems [13], VAT in particular is linked to increased metabolic risk [14–16]. In addition, VAT is lost preferentially over SAT during weight loss [17]. Little is known, however, whether the preferential loss of VAT also occurs in the mouse during hindlimb unloading.Microgravity and HLU also reduce lean tissue mass and muscle size [1], associated with muscle atrophy in postural muscles containing primarily slow-twitch muscle fibers [18,19]. Bone receives mechanical input both from muscle forces as well as from ground reaction forces during gravitational impact [20]. As ground reaction forces are removed during HLU, muscle activity provides the dominant source of mechanical cues [21]. In contrast, ambulatory activities upon release from HLU engage both muscle and impact with the ground, perhaps disassociating muscle and bone recovery. While muscle-bone relations during disuse have been investigated in the hindlimbs [21–23], the extent by which muscle forces maintain vertebral bone is much less understood. And even though bone loss throughout the skeleton environment is site-specific in microgravity [24], it is largely unknown whether the response of the spine to HLU and reambulation (RA) is similar to peripheral skeletal sites [25].We previously demonstrated in C57BL/6 mice that overall, multiple exposures to hindlimb unloading were more detrimental than a single unloading cycle to both cortical and trabecular bone in the distal femur metaphysis [26]. Nevertheless, the magnitude of bone loss diminished during the second and third unloading cycle. Whether these two phenomena observed in the appendicular skeleton extend to lumbar vertebrae, abdominal lean tissue volume, muscle cross-sectional area, and adipose tissue is unknown. Here, using new data collected during the previous experiment [26], we hypothesized that because of bone’s incomplete ability to recover during RA, multiple unloading cycles would be more detrimental than a single unloading cycle to lumbar apparent bone mineral density. We also hypothesized that previous exposures to unloading will attenuate the response of fat, muscle and bone to subsequent loading cycles. Further, based on associations between serum leptin and bone loss, we hypothesized a positive, linear relationship between bone loss and adipose tissue loss, as well as bone loss and muscle loss."

        "Title": "Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAnthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e.\nI\nmax\n/\nI\nmin\n). Individuals with high\nI\nmax\n/\nI\nmin\nvalues are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of\nI\nmax\nand\nI\nmin\ncompared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the\nI\nmax\n/\nI\nmin\nindex.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAnthropologists frequently analyze the cross-sectional geometry of lower limb bone shafts to infer the physical activity levels of past humans from their skeletal remains (Ruff,2008). This strategy is based on the well-documented capacity of bone shafts to adjust their morphology in response to mechanical loading, particularly during the growing years (Lieberman et al.2001; McKay et al.2005; Weeks et al.2008). Of the geometric properties used to infer activity levels, the bending strength index is often considered the most informative (Ruff,1987; Brock & Ruff,1988; Larsen et al.1995; Holt,2003; Stock,2006; Lieverse et al.2011).The bending strength index can be calculated in two ways, as the ratio of shaft second moments of area in the anteroposterior plane to second moments of area in the mediolateral plane (Ix/Iy) and, more commonly, as the ratio of second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (Imax/Imin). Shafts withIx/Iyvalues close to 1 are roughly circular, whereas shafts with values greater or < 1 are more elliptical. The same logic applies toImax/Imin, but this ratio is always ≥ 1. In anthropological analyses, individuals with elliptical shafts are inferred to have been more physically active, as doing a lot of walking and running will tend to stress one's lower limb bones in a particular direction (Cavanagh & LaFortune,1980; Munro et al.1987; Yang et al.2014), whereas individuals with circular shafts are inferred to have been more sedentary.The utility of a relatively simple measure of physical activity level such as the bone shaft bending strength index is readily apparent. However, while there is strong experimental support for a causal link between physical activity level and cross-sectional properties describing overall shaft robusticity (size), direct evidence is currently lacking that activity level has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments involving mice as a model organism that tested whether high activity levels indeed lead to more elliptical limb bone shafts and low activity levels lead to more circular shafts. In the first experiment, animals were treated daily with a treadmill exercise regimen to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, animals were suspended from their tails to cause prolonged limb unloading and simulate a low-activity lifestyle."

        "Title": "Focal enhancement of the skeleton to exercise correlates to mesenchymal stem cell responsivity rather than peak external forces.",
        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nForce magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces caused by exercise.\nKEY WORDS:\nPhysical activity, Ground reaction forces, Bone adaptation, Cortical bone, Trabecular bone, Osteoprogenitor cells, Mechanical loading",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.",

        "Title": "Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLittle is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.\nKeywords:\nMuscle, Bone, Disuse, Genetics, Mouse",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe concept of a muscle-bone unit tuned to the magnitude of contractile forces has intuitive appeal as reflected by Darcy Thompson in 1917[1]: “Muscle and bone … are inseparably associated and connected; they are moulded one with another; they come into being together, and act and react together.” Indeed, strong correlations between muscle mass and bone mass have been found in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies, particularly over the course of growth and development[2], leading many to believe that mechanically adaptive changes in bone are initiated primarily by changes in muscle activity. Both cortical and trabecular bone have been included in muscle-bone correlations but it is unclear which type of bone is more highly associated with muscle strength[3-5].Inherently, correlations used in these studies cannot infer causality and, alternatively, may reflect an indirect association via a shared underlying molecular signal[6]. Exercise induces a highly site-specific mechanical environment in the skeleton[7], yet high correlations between muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) span distant sites in the skeleton[8]. Thus, an association between muscle and bone may be more global than peak muscle forces locally altering bone (re)modeling at the specific anatomical site at which they act.Furthermore, if muscle was a causal factor during bone development, then increased muscle mass and muscle strength should precede the majority of bone mineral accrual. While such a sequential relationship has been observed using two-dimensional DXA[9], three-dimensional CT data show that bone mineral accrual may cease before peak muscle strength is reached[10]. At the other end of the spectrum, age-related sarcopenia reduces muscle loading of bone and, therefore, should induce bone loss. Contrary to the proposed functional muscle-bone relationship, substantial bone loss can precede equivalently detectable losses in muscle by nearly a decade[11].These examples demonstrate inconsistencies in the paradigm of a muscle-bone unit that is regulated by the force exerted in skeletal muscle. The drastic changes in the mechanical environment associated with unloading and reambulation of the musculoskeleton during spaceflight, bedrest, or injury/disease provide a model system to further test muscle-bone interactions. Reflecting the high sensitivity of the musculoskeleton to mechanical signals, unloading causes both sarcopenia and osteopenia in humans and animal models[12,13] while reambulation recovers, at least in part, these losses[14-16]. Further, differences in genetic make-up between individuals, humans or mice[17,18], have been shown to greatly influence the magnitude of the skeletal response to unloading and reambulation, providing an opportunity to relate intra-individual differences in musculoskeletal adaptation across a wide phenotypic range.Muscle-bone relations can be tested at different levels – from molecules to organs. While molecular interactions have recently received considerable attention[19,20], much less is known about the genes that determine differences in musculoskeletal sensitivity to mechanical signals based on an individual’s genetic make-up. For trabecular bone, we have identified specific regions on chromosomes that harbor regulatory genes (quantitative trait loci or QTL) explaining the variability in bone’s response to unloading and reambulation across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population[18]. QTLs that regulate the susceptibility of cortical bone and muscle to unloading and subsequent reambulation are yet to be identified. Comparing regulatory genetic regions for the mechano-response between muscle and bone would afford insight into the muscle-bone unit at the genetic level.In an effort to test muscle-bone interactions at the tissue and genetic level, we used more than 350 adult mice from a genetically heterogeneous mouse population that display a large range of trabecular responses to unloading and reambulation[15,18,21]. Changes in muscle and cortical bone morphology during 3wk of unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation were quantified and associated with each other to test the hypothesis that those individuals who show the greatest muscular changes will coincide with those who show the greatest changes in bone. At the genetic level, the hypothesis that unloading/reambulation QTLs are similar between muscle and bone was considered."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOsteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively,\np\n< 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl,\np\n< 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl,\np\n<0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionBone remodeling, the sequential resorption of a bone packet by osteoclasts followed by deposition of new tissue at the same site by osteoblasts,(1–3)can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including microdamage,(4–8)changes in endocrine status (eg, ovarian hormone depletion),(9–12)and mechanical unloading or disuse.(13–15)In each instance, the activation of bone remodeling has been spatially and temporally associated with osteocyte apoptosis,(6,16–18)which precedes the recruitment of osteoclasts that resorb the region of bone containing the apoptotic osteocytes.(6,17–20)Moreover, this osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering bone resorption in response to microdamage and estrogen loss. Pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis after bone fatigue or estrogen loss completely prevented both the activation of bone resorption and the bone loss that occur in response to these challenges.(19,20)Recent studies at microdamage sites in bone reveal that the dying osteocytes trigger viable, neighbor osteocytes to increase expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), thus activating focal resorption.(21,22)Whether activation of resorption in other remodeling states, such as disuse or estrogen loss, operates through the same combination of osteocyte-based mechanisms (ie, apoptosis triggering resorption via activation of RANKL signaling from intact osteocytes) is unclear.Mechanical loading is of paramount importance to the maintenance of adult bone mass and architecture and to bone health in general. Prolonged unloading from space flight, extended bed rest, or paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury results in extensive and often irreversible bone loss. Disuse stimulates aggressive and extensive bone resorption in both cortical and cancellous bone in humans(23–26)and in animal models including primates(27,28)and dogs,(29–31)as well as mice(17,32,33)and rats(34,35)subjected to hindlimb unloading. Yet whether osteocyte apoptosis plays a causal role in activating bone resorption in disuse, as it does in microdamage and ovariectomy, is not fully resolved. Previously, Aguirre and colleagues(17)had shown that osteocyte apoptosis occurs in vertebral bone of tail-suspended, hindlimb-unloaded mice, indicating adverse effects on osteocyte integrity in this model. A recent study by Plotkin and colleagues(18)further concluded that dying osteocytes in lumbar vertebrae of hindlimb-unloaded mice do not significantly influence bone resorption. Here we report that, in contrast, both resorption activation and bone loss in long bones of mice subjected to hindlimb unloading are fully dependent on osteocyte apoptosis."

        "Title": "Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50\ng\nhypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.\nKeywords:\nmechanotransduction, embryoid bodies, embryonic stem cells, single cell RNA sequencing, development",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionDifferentiation, stem cell fate decisions and developmental patterning are regulated by a variety of spatiotemporal influences. The mechanical environment, defined by unit gravity on Earth, is one such influencer, modulating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions via physical strain sensing through integrin and cadherin adhesion receptor signaling. These physical strains are then converted into cell signaling and transcriptional responses by a process termed mechanotransduction [1–3]. In a whole organism the tissue mechanical environment can be regulated by intrinsic factors such as blood pressure, muscle contraction, and others, or by extrinsic factors such as gravity weight-bearing and posture. Also, of importance are the cyclic nature of these normal loading and unloading processes.On Earth, mammalian tissues normal hydrostatic pressures due to vascular activity can vary in the range of 0.2–16 kPa, while pressures can go as high as 5–6 MPa in weight-bearing bone and cartilage and to 18 MPa while running or jumping [4]. However, the calculated hydrostatic pressure in a standard static mammalian laboratory cell culture (with a fluid medium with density of 1 kg/m3and height of 1 cm, at 1g) is only about 0.1 kPa, well below normal tissue physiological mechanical loading conditions.To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used including applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment.Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that can be turned toward specific fates by exclusive modulation of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these methods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type, removing the cultures from physiologic relevance. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are a three-dimensional (3D) model of embryo development inclusive of all pre-implant cell lineages and germ layers within 7–12 days, providing a physiologically relevant platform for regenerative medicine and developmental studies [12,13]. Investigations of 3D EB models exposed to mechanical perturbation are rare, and rarer still are transcriptomic characterization of mechanotransduction regulation of development.The most studied physical stress relevant to the EB model is fluid shear stress [14], imparted by spinner flasks [15] or microfluidic channels [16,17], or rotating wall vessels [9] used in their culture. Generally, these studies have shown that fluidic shear stress promotes growth and maturation; however, this general observation has been refined as the study of mechanical regulation of EBs has expanded. A 2010 study presented data that controlling the speed of hydrodynamic stimulation changes viability of the cells within the spheroid [18]. More direct stretch mechanical loading increases angiogenesis within the EB and increases the localization of beating cardiomyocyte foci [19]. Dynamic cyclic stretch to EBs encourages differentiation toward mesodermal lineages with the resulting terminal cell type selectable by manipulating the compressive and tensile strains [20].As positive mechanical loading corresponds to increased differentiation commitment, reduced mechanical strain can be hypothesized to result in the maintenance of embryonic potency markers. Hanging drop and suspension EB cultures found increased apoptotic cell accumulations and irregular morphology in comparison to rotary fluid shear EB culture [21], although these may be explained by decreased mass transport around and inside EB. EBs space flown in low earth orbit for 15 days under microgravity conditions retained self-renewal markers and showed inhibition of ESC differentiation and germ layer lineage markers, however, upon return to earth-normal 1 g loading, the EBs demonstrated increased ability to readily differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes [22,23]. These results mirror findings that EBs derived from ESCs exposed to fluidic shear stress before aggregation are primed for differentiation, resulting in increased endothelial markers and spatial organization [24].Mechanically regulated engineerability of developmental models has application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as self-organization and patterning are necessary for functional repair or replacement of tissue deficits. An intermediate step for development of many organoid models is induced pluripotent stem cell aggregation into EBs before additional chemical treatment [25], thus transcriptomic information from the EB stage could help improve fidelity of organoids and the research for which they are utilized. However, lack of a thorough understanding of transcriptomic regulation within difficult-to-access EB spheroids has hindered the development of the field.Novel single cell transcriptomic approaches are beginning to bridge this deficit with recent work describing pre-implantation embryos and in vitro EBs [26], germ layer developmental trajectory [27,28], and organoid efficacy assessment [29,30]. The use of single cell resolution has enabled detection of transient cell populations existing between established embryo staging, providing further insight into developmental programs, lineage decision omics and has exposed potential new cell classifications as targets for directed differentiation [27,28]. Our investigation utilizes single cell transcriptomics technology to probe how the absence of mechanical perturbation, similar to microgravity unloading, alters developmental programing in the EB model compared to a single pulse of physiologically relevant loading by HG."

Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of\nA\n.\nfumigatus\nand highlight the ability of different\nA\n.\nfumigatus\nstrains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumans inhale hundreds ofAspergillus fumigatusspores from the environment every day and yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection. Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease,Aspergillusspores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune mechanisms that controlAspergillus in vivo.In immunocompetent individuals, the innate immune system is generally sufficient forA.fumigatusclearance, with both macrophages and neutrophils playing major roles [3]. Macrophages primarily target and phagocytose conidia (spores), and can kill conidiain vitrowithin hours [4,5].In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice [6] and others demonstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice [7]. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are consistently required in mice in response toAspergillus[6,8], and neutropenia is a key risk factor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis [9]. Neutrophils can kill conidiain vivo[10] and inhibit conidial germination bothin vitroandin vivo[11,12]. Immune cell populations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response toAspergillusthrough pro-inflammatory gene expression [13,14]. However, the full extent of macrophage/monocyte and neutrophil interactions throughout the course of infection, and their effect on fungal growth and clearance, are not known.Perhaps the most important step inAspergilluspathogenesis is germination, the developmental switch from resting, dormant conidia to filamentous, invasive growth [15]. These different fungal forms induce differential activation of immune cellsin vitroand recruitment of these cellsin vivo[16–18]. After invasive hyphae have developed, neutrophils can respond with a variety of killing mechanisms [11,19–21]. However, how this switch, and specifically earlier stages of fungal germination prior to the development of extensive invasive growth, affects immune activation, fungal clearance, and disease progressionin vivois largely unknown.Larval zebrafish provide an ideal model in which to study the early effects of fungal germination as well as the interplay between multiple immune cell types throughout infection. Larval zebrafish are transparent and can be non-invasively imaged and therefore allow for visualization of innate immune cell behavior and fungal development in a live, intact host throughout a multi-day infection. While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums (~107conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-pathogen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts [22].Aspergillusinfection models in zebrafish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and post-germination neutrophil recruitment [21,23]. These models have already provided new insight into the biology of immune responses toAspergillussuch as the observation of spore transfer between macrophages [24].In this study, we have infected larval zebrafish withAspergillus fumigatusstrains derived from patient isolates Af293 and CEA10. Heterogeneity amongA.fumigatusisolates has been increasingly recognized [25], and Af293 and CEA10 in particular are known to be differentially virulent in specific mouse and zebrafish models [26–28]. The genomes of these strains differ by ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is an approximately average level of genetic diversity among sequencedA.fumigatusisolates [28]. Af293 and CEA10 strains also possess differences in growth [27], activation of the host immune response [27,29], response to hypoxia [26], secondary metabolism [30,31], and response to light [32]. We aimed to use these two different strains coupled with live imaging in larval zebrafish to identify and characterize differential neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response toA.fumigatusinfection.We report that while CEA10 is generally regarded as more virulent than Af293 [26,27], CEA10-derived strains are killed better than Af293-derived strainsin vivo, even while CEA10-derived strains germinate faster. Host inflammatory activation, partially through Myd88, is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain, but strikingly, is not sufficient for clearance of an Af293-derived strain. Macrophages only marginally contribute to clearance of CEA10-derived strains. Instead, macrophages primarily provide a protective niche for spores, forming tight, dense clusters around the fungus, inhibiting spore germination. Our data demonstrate that germination actually drives fungal clearance through neutrophil-mediated killing."

        "Title": "Contributions of spore secondary metabolites to UV-C protection and virulence vary in different Aspergillus fumigatus strains",
        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nFungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen\nAspergillus fumigatus\nhave been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to\nA. fumigatus\nisolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical\nA. fumigatus\nstrains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield\nA. fumigatus\nfrom the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of different\nA. fumigatus\nisolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across\nAspergillus\nisolates and by types of environmental stress.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionDrosophilais well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann2007). TheDrosophilaToll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis2006). Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of theDrosophilaand human immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler2001). InDrosophila, the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al.2008; Brennan et al.2007; Gateff1994; Rizki and Rizki1983; Tepass et al.1994; Vass and Nappi2000). The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and Silverman2007).Drosophilaproduces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister2007). Plasmatocytes account for ~95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute ~5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates,Drosophilablood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al.2003). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee2003; Mandal et al.2007).A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes inDrosophilais that of melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al.1995; Meister and Lagueux2003; Minakhina and Steward2006b; Stofanko et al.2008). Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al.2003; Li2008; Minakhina and Steward2006a; Zettervall et al.2004). Some other genes with this mutant phenotype areair8, encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al.1992);black pearl, encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al.2001);l(3)malignant bloodneoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff1994);yantar, encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al.2004); and the Polycomb group genemulti sex combs(Remillieux-Leschelle et al.2002). The melanotic tumor genes are an important category to identify and define in order to understand blood cell function and regulation.In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor genedappled(dpld) (Rodriguez et al.1996). Enhancer detector expression ofdappledwas high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations ofdappledproduced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al.1996). A distinguishing feature ofdappledmutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification ofdappledas a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson2003). Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones (Locuson et al.2007; Miller2005; Yamazaki and Shimada2006). Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, anddappledprovides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize thedappledmutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect thedappledhemocyte phenotype."

        "Title": "A novel phototropic response to red light is revealed in microgravity.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMain conclusion\nBlue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity.\nDue to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three\nArabidopsis thaliana\ngenotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1\ng\n. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1\ng\n. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in\nArabidopsis\nroots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.\nKeywords:\nArabidopsis, Fractional gravity, Microgravity, Phototropism, Reduced gravity, Spaceflight",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized byDarwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism,Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism,Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectivelyBriggs 1964;Vandenbrink et al. 2014a,b;Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism,Chen et al. 1999;Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987;Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012;Briggs 2014;Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003;Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002).Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978;Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008;Silva-Navas et al. 2015).To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified inArabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003;Kiss et al. 2003;Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004;Kumar et al. 2008).The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010;Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector.While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g;Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g,and 1genvironments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g,and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism.There are different ways to study the effect of microgravity on an organism (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). Real microgravity research onboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides the most valuable information (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016), but it involves high cost and the access to it is very limited. Compared to a typical ground experiment, which usually involves practically unlimited sample size and the necessary number of performing personnel, spaceflight research imposes major limitations, including the size of and access to experiment equipment and the availability of trained staff and supplies needed to perform the scientific work. Furthermore, there are significant technical challenges that need to be overcome in the design and development of the experimental hardware necessary to operate in low gravity conditions. Retrieval, processing and storage of biological samples need to be optimized, in some cases by developing complex and costly procedures.Despite all these constraints, six decades of research on the effects of long- and short-term missions to space have resulted in a consistent knowledge of many aspects of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, mainly exposure to microgravity, on biological systems. The story started with the sending to space of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. The Soviet Oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the Cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. Soon after, the facility was used by cosmonauts in the manned Salyut 1 mission in 1971 to grow different plant crop species. Since then, different plant cultivation experiments have been flown on crewed vehicles, including the Soviet/Russian Salyut and Mir, the American Shuttle, the Chinese Shenzou, and the ISS. Continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat, latest in the series of plant growth systems installed in the ISS (Ray et al., 2019;Zabel et al., 2016). All these steps were directed to achieve the main objective of spaceflight biology, which was to gain an understanding of adaptive processes triggered by terrestrial organisms when they are confronted with the novel space environment. The knowledge of the environmental limits of terrestrial biology in spaceflight is key to the design of successful space exploration strategies (Des Marais et al., 2008).During spaceflight, exposure to a novel environment, previously unknown for terrestrial organisms, causes them to modify their growth and development patterns to a greater or lesser extent. These patterns are characterized by certain gene expression profiles capable of guiding growth and ensuring survival. During spaceflight, some sets of genes that were repressed in other environmental conditions are expressed and some other sets of genes are repressed in an attempt to cope with the new environment and adapt, or acclimate, to it (Paul et al., 2012). This response is not unique to plants, but it is enhanced in these organisms by the great reserve of plasticity exhibited by plant genomes, that enables them to respond to unforeseen environmental conditions, such as gravity alteration (Medina et al., 2021). In general, this plasticity is necessary because of the sessile character of plants that immobilizes them to the ground and disables them to escape to another place if the environmental conditions became adverse. One of the sources of genome plasticity is gene redundancy, a feature much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. Plants have undergone extensive duplications (up to four times) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes (Wang et al., 2011). For example, multiple cyclins and CDKs involved in cell proliferation control exhibit redundant mechanisms for producing the same effect in cell cycle checkpoints (Francis, 2011). In addition to gene redundancy, quicker mechanisms like transposable elements or epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation operate under environmental stress (Lukens and Zhan, 2007).This article revises the results of some relevant experiments performed in the ISS during the last decade and the knowledge acquired from them in terms of changes in gene expression at the global genome level (space omics). These changes are related to the acclimation or adaptation of plants to survive, grow and develop under the altered gravity conditions of extraterrestrial environments, either the microgravity characterizing spaceflight, or the partial gravity levels that can be found in the Moon and Mars surfaces. Together with gravity, another environmental stimulus is analyzed extensively, which is light. Both gravity and light are responsible for the two main tropisms that drive plant growth, namely gravitropism and phototropism. The regulatory effects of light and gravity on plant growth are closely related. An outstanding recent example of this relationship is the light regulation of the expression ofLAZY4, a gene that plays an important role in the gravitropic response of both shoots and roots (Yang et al., 2020). In addition, upregulation of genes involved in a fundamental light-dependent function, such as photosynthesis, has been found as a response to microgravity condition in spaceflight, and, interestingly, this response occurred in etiolated plants, in the absence of any light signal (Kruse et al., 2020). The question on whether the deleterious effects of altered gravity could be compensated by light, or not, is critical for the success of plant culture in future human settlements on other planets, but attention to other suboptimal environmental parameters that may be unavoidable in spaceflight as cosmic radiation or reduced access to water or gas exchange may be also evaluated. In that regard, this review pays particular attention and its organized by the hardware used in each experiment, being crucial to understand the differential results observed in the “habitats” provided for each facility, in terms of suboptimal environmental conditions and particularly light.The adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under darkness condition (BRIC experiments)A series of experiments called “Biological Research in Canisters” (BRIC) were performed in the NASA BRIC hardware, which consists of a simple compartment (canister) holding six 60-mm Petri dishes in small subcompartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Unit cassettes) (Table S1). The PDFUs allow the sample fixation inside using an actuator gun. The BRIC hardware was flown as nonpowered payload so the seedlings were grown in the dark for the experiment duration, although a further development called BRIC-LED was implemented, providing lighting capabilities. In particular, BRIC-16 consisted of three individual experiments performed by three research groups as part of the STS-131 mission on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2010. All BRIC-16 flight samples were grown in darkness for 309 h (12 days and 21h) and then fixed in RNAlater in-orbit. The Ground Control were BRICs prepared identical to spaceflight samples housed in Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) at the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL-KSC) with a 24-h delay to enable duplication of the environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and CO2concentration) collected by telemetry from the space shuttle (Johnson et al., 2017;Kwon et al., 2015;Paul et al., 2012) (Table 1).Table 1.Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under darknessConditionsEcotypeFixationTissueAuthorsGLDSμgdark 12 daysCol-0RNAlaterSeedlingsPaul et al.

See alsoTable S1The BRIC-16-DNA experiment (Impact of Spaceflight onArabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome of Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cell in Space) disclosed thatA. thalianaecotype Columbia (Col-0) seedlings grown in space change the expression of 300 genes with respect to ground control samples. Between the differentially genes expressed, genes upregulated are associated with pathogen response, wounding, drought stress and cold stress (generalized stress-response) and genes downregulated are transcription factors involved in cell wall metabolism and cell elongation and genes encoding proteins that function in calcium-mediated signaling (gravitropism). The authors suggest that both the gravity signaling system and the stress signaling related to wounding and pathogens converge in their responses involving the actin-based cytoskeletal network attached to plasma membrane and the cell wall. It is possible that any of these signaling mechanisms are balanced by the force of gravity. Hence, the absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, inducing inappropriate stress responses as a consequence (Paul et al., 2012).The transcriptional analysis of BRIC-16-Regulation experiment (Actin Regulation ofArabidopsisRoot Growth and Orientation During Space Flight) showed that spaceflight conditions triggered the downregulation of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in Col-0 seedlings. Most of these genes are expressed in root hairs (class III peroxidase genes) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated in the otherArabidopsisline included in this experiment, theact2-3mutant. These gene expression changes led to shorter root hairs in space-grown seedlings. It is unclear whether this effect was due to microgravityper seor it was a consequence of other spaceflight environmental conditions producing stress, such as hypoxia, which produces the same phenotypic effect. Actually, the BRIC hardware system has several limitations: One is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time, and other is the absence of orbit 1gcontrol which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects (Kwon et al., 2015).BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton study (Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry) focused on gene expression changes in shoots of Ler-0 plants. The functional analysis showed that many upregulated transcripts in spaceflight conditions were implicated in metabolic process and transport. Most of these genes were localized in the extracellular matrix and involved in cell wall modification. On the other hand, and unlike the other two BRIC-16 experiments, the downregulated genes were often involved in stress response. This result was associated with the fact that the transcriptional analysis only included shoots. At the same time, an abundance of adventitious roots (immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots) was observed in spaceflight seedlings, suggesting that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. Therefore, pooling all plant organs together for a single analysis could provide an incomplete picture.The BRIC-16 was a cluster of spaceflight experiments performed during the same space mission (STS-131) in the same hardware (Biological Research in Canister, BRIC) with the goal of studying the longer-term plant survival response in the spaceflight environment. Despite these common features, and even though transcripts within the same functional categories (stress response, defense, metabolic processes and cell wall modification) were found to be involved in the response in the different experiments, some differing results were obtained. These differences were associated to the specific experimental conditions of each one of the experiments: BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used the Col-0 ecotype as wild type whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used the Ler-0 ecotype; BRIC-16-Regulation and BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton growth media was half-strength MS salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose in agar, but BRIC-16-DNA used only half-strength MS salts in phytagel; BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Regulation used in microarray analysis RNA from entire seedlings whereas BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton used RNA from shoots only (Johnson et al., 2017).The mission SpaceX CRS-4, launched on September 21, 2014, carried a new BRIC experiment with the aim of dissecting plant stress responses and revealing novel pathways for these responses triggered in space. RNA sequencing after growing for 8 days on board the ISS allowed the comparison of the transcriptomes of fourA. thalianaecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0 and Cvi-0) with ground-based control (a duplicated set of BRICs transferred to the ISS Environmental Simulator-ISSES with a 48-h delay to the flight experiment) (Table 1). Cvi-0 seedlings were those with the highest number of genes with deregulated expression, followed by Col-0 and WS-2 plants. In contrast, the Ler-0 plants barely showed changes in the expression of their genes. Common in all ecotypes, transcripts from heat-shock proteins (chaperones) were upregulated, whereas peroxidase transcripts were downregulated in spaceflight (Choi et al., 2019). According to the authors, this shared induction of molecular chaperones may help to protect cellular machinery from oxidative stress potentially triggered by hardware-dependent hypoxic response. In fact, alterations in growth and molecular responses in seedlings grown in BRIC have been described, raising the possibility that this hardware may impose intrinsic stresses on the plants and cause a response in some genes unrelated with the spaceflight environment (Basu et al., 2017;Johnson et al., 2017). The spaceflight ecotype-unique transcripts analysis showed that Cvi-0 was enriched in genes involved in light stress, kinase signaling and cell wall modification, Col-0 was enriched in transcripts related to cold and sugar response and, in Ws-2, enrichment in responses related to oxidative stress response was detected. Instead, Ler-0 also showed no significantly over-represented processes because of the small number of genes changing their expression. These results bring out significant differences between ecotype behavior, being Col-0 and Cvi-0 much more responsive to spaceflight conditions, whereas Ler-0 appeared to be relatively resistant to the same conditions, and therefore, highlighting the need to carefully consider the genetic background when comparing data sets and designing spaceflight experiments (Choi et al., 2019).Another experiment that used the BRIC hardware to quantify protein and transcript differential expression of 3-day-old, etiolated Col-0 seedlings grown aboard the ISS, was launched on January 10, 2015 (Space-X CRS-5). The simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight (Kruse et al., 2020). In addition to the ground control (at ISSES with 48-h delay), in this experiment, two additional analyses were performed to eliminate significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome ofArabidopsisseedlings that could be attributed to the hardware (Basu et al., 2017) or to the RNAlater preservative (Kruse et al., 2017) (Table 1). These studies revealed marked impacts on post- transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics and plastid gene transcription in the plants exposed to microgravity. The effects on microtubule dynamics (alpha tubulins) were explained as a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, because alpha tubulin has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of cells in microgravity. A wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes appeared differentially regulated in the flight samples, but they were not present in the proteomic data. This result was surprising because BRIC hardware prevents all light from reaching the plants, and it was interpreted as a wasteful effort to enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. In summary, the unified transcriptomic and proteomic analysis points out the regulation of specific elements of cell wall, microtubule synthesis and plastid transcripts production as three new targets to achieve optimal plant growth during future long-term spaceflight missions (Kruse et al., 2020).During SpaceX CRS-12 mission (launched August 14, 2017) transcriptional responses of Col-0 seedlings and seedlings with a compromised unfolded protein response (UPR) to spaceflight were examined with the objective of studying how this response, which is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses, could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. For this, the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware was used to grow for 14 daysArabidopsis thalianawildtype and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP28 and bZIP60 (single and double mutants:bzip28,bzip60andbzip28 bzip60) and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1 (atire1). The transcriptomic results showed that growth in orbit substantially altered expression of thousands of genes associated with biological functions compared with ground control across all genotypes. Specifically, WT had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (1675 DEGs upregulated and 831 DEGs downregulated) and the bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs (1293 upregulated and 562 downregulated). Among these DEGs, 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated and 27.5% (335//1217) of downregulated overlapped across all genotypes whereas relatively smaller numbers of DEGs were found to be genotype-specific. Therefore, with the aim to gain more insights into the transcriptome changes caused by the absence of a correct UPR signaling under both ground and space flight conditions, the authors performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for all DEGs. This analysis became clear that many of these spaceflight responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control and that these variations in ground samples expression were largely muted by spaceflight. Therefore, a genotype-specific regulation in spaceflight condition was not observed. Overall, these results would suggest that the UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight but could play a partial role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control. The reason could be that under space flight conditions many related stress-responsive genes were downregulated, being able to produce alternative signaling pathways, which repress the observed stress responses regulated by UPR (Angelos et al., 2021).The adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light conditionsThe TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) flight experiment, constituted by several independent runs launched to the ISS (Run 1: STS-129 November 16, 2009. Run 2: STS-130 February 8, 2010. Run 3: STS-131 April 5, 2010) was conducted within the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) hardware. This facility allowed to growArabidopsisseedlings on standard laboratory Petri plates and provided controlled lighting, temperature and air quality, and minimizing hardware-induced stress factors. In the three biological replicates, seedlings germinated, grew for 12 days and were harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs). After returning to Earth, they were dissected into roots, leaves and hypocotyls for transcriptomic analysis (microarray). Ground control experiments (one per biological replicate) were conducted using identical ABRS hardware housed in OES chamber programmed to ISS environmental conditions (Paul et al., 2013) (Table 2). The microarray analysis showed that only 480 genes were differentially expressed in spaceflight samples in any organ, but most of these genes were not coordinately expressed among organs (only 26 genes were common in roots, hypocotyls and leaves). Although each organ displayed unique patterns of gene expression in response to spaceflight, the genes were involved in the same functional processes: the down-regulated genes were largely associated with factors regulating cell elongation and hormone signal transduction and the up-regulated genes were closely associated with pathogen responses, wounding and cell wall remodeling. Based on the results obtained, the authors pointed out that spaceflight environments had become extremely well controlled, there hardly being hardware-dependent factors, as indicated by the low number of genes with deregulated expression (48). Therefore, leaves, roots, and hypocotyls engage different genes in response to the spaceflight environment, but utilize similar adaptive strategies, consisting of initiating cellular remodeling and maximizing other environmental cues (for example, light) in a morphological response which is essential to produce a correct growth and development (Paul et al., 2013).Table 2.Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light conditionsConditionsEcotypeFixationTissueAuthorsGLDSABRSμglight 12 daysAdh:GFP, DR5r:GFP,35s:GFPRNAlaterRoot Leaf HypocotylPaul et al.

See alsoTable S1The CARA experiment (CharacterizingArabidopsisRoot Attractions, launched on SpaceX CRS-3, April 18th 2014) consisted of growing threeArabidopsis thalianagenotypes (wild-types Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and phytochrome D mutant Col-0 PhyD (phyD)) on Phytagel plates for 11 days secured to a fabric support to the wall in the US lab of the ISS Destiny module. Some of them grew with the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark, wrapped in blackout cloth. After a growth period of 11 days, samples were harvested into KFTs containing RNAlater. A comparable set of plates, grown within the ISSES, monitoring temperature, CO2, relative humidity and light levels, with a delay of 24 h after the initiation of the spaceflight experiment, was the ground control (Paul et al., 2017) (Table 2). The transcriptome responses in the root tips, which was the unique tissue used, showed that differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those shared with another genotype. Under light exposure, Col-0 showed the greatest number of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight (297),phyDchanged the expression of 130 genes and in WS only 71 genes were deregulated. Furthermore, each genotype used almost completely different sets of genes to physiologically adapt to the environment of the ISS. If this differential gene expression is considered as a measure of the physiological adaptive response cost, the WS ecotype would be better adapted to spaceflight than Col-0, andphyDmutation would be considered as a spaceflight-adaptive mutation in Col-0 background, suggesting that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. In the dark, WS and Col-0 seedlings showed roughly the same number of differentially expressed genes (218 and 224, respectively) andphyDexhibited the fewest genes with differential expression (131) indicating that the light environment affects physiological adaptation to spaceflight, which implies that the local habitat can be another factor that can be manipulated to reduce this cost. In this space experiment, all three genotypes were developmentally comparable to the ground control plants and they were equally productive in terms of root length so that only coordinately expressed genes shared amongst the genotypes (18 genes in light and 11 in dark) were considered fundamentally required for physiological adaptation ofArabidopsisto spaceflight. Most of them were up-regulated genes associated with defense mechanisms or cell wall (Paul et al., 2017).The RNA sequencing data collected from root tissue of Col-0 and WS seedlings grown in APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03–2) space experiment was used to investigate the role of alternative splicing during spaceflight adaptation in plants because it was described that terrestrial plant stressors arise unique alternative splicing patterns. In APEX03-2 experiment, launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, the seedlings grew on Phytagel Petri dishes kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source within the Vegetable Production System (VPS/VEGGIE) on board the ISS. The ground control was carried out inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES chamber at KSC with a 48-h delay (Beisel et al., 2019;Ferl and Paul, 2016) (Table 2). Opposite to the pattern observed for differentially expressed genes, the analysis of the alternative splicing showed that fewer genes undergo spaceflight-induced significant differential alternative splicing in the Col-0 ecotype background (27) as compared to WS (48), with only 5 overlapping genes between them (Paul et al., 2017). Moreover, gene ontology analysis did not reveal any obvious conclusions respect to the function or localization of the genes with alternative splicing during spaceflight exposure. Although the detection of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms in spaceflight samples, regarding abundance, types, and functional implications, is still pending further investigation, this study presented strong evidence that alternative splicing plays a role in the process of molecular adaptation to the spaceflight environment in plants (Beisel et al., 2019).The Advanced Plant Experiments 03–2 also studied the hypothesis that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via cell wall remodeling. Differential gene expression profiles of two mutants, differing in their ecotype background, defective in two well-characterized genes which affect different skewing control pathways (spr1andsku5) and their wild type controls (Col-0 and WS) were examined after growing for 4 and 8 days on ISS. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics andspr1mutation results in axial rotation of cell files throughout the plant, which manifests in roots as skewing to the left. SKU5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein implicated in stress response signaling andsku5mutant exhibits rightward skewing (Table 2).Morphological data (angle between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings) showed thatspr1seedlings exhibited a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth that was substantially enhanced by spaceflight. Instead,sku5mutant showed a prevention of skewing in spaceflight compared to the ground control. The root length was not altered in either mutant line by spaceflight. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that inspr1seedlings the number of differential gene expression under spaceflight condition was less than in Col-0 seedlings. In addition, both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8-day timepoint than at 4-day. In contrast,sku5seedlings the spaceflight differentially expressed genes were five-fold and two-fold more than WS at 4 days and 8 days, respectively. Also, both genotypes increase in their deregulated genes between 4 and 8 days.Among genes that were upregulated in spaceflight forsku5many were LEA (Late Embryogenesis abundant) family genes, associated with seed dormancy, negative regulation of post-embryonic development and ABA signaling to enhance stress resistance (osmotic, cold, and drought) through membrane stabilization, ROS sequestration and protein aggregation prevention. Moreover, processes involved with salt, ROS stress, and light responses were terms enriched significantly at 4 days and at 8 days and terms associated with cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes were overrepresented.Thesku5andspr1different gene expression patterns, considering the number of differentially expressed genes and their fold-change levels as a measure of metabolic cost of adapting to environment, suggest that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation and the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, the fact thatspr1andsku5root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, indicate that the effects of these mutations lie in processes directing morphology and structure and not in growth processes (Califar et al., 2020).WS seedlings grown in the spaceflight experiment APEX03-2 for 11 days with constant light were used for the determination of differential methylation of leaves and roots (bisulfite DNA sequencing) and differential gene expression (RNA sequencing) in response to spaceflight (Table 2). The authors expected to elucidate the role played by the epigenome in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. It is well documented that terrestrial biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attack, salt, and drought stress, are elicitors of differential DNA methylation (Zhou et al., 2019). Many genes of the networks involved in the response to these stresses are differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. The results indicated that although large scale alteration of the average methylation level was not detected in CG, CHG and CHH contexts between flight and ground DNA, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered with clear organ-specific patterns. In roots, hypomethylated CHH sites predominated whereas leaves showed a predominance of hypermethylated CHH sites. In leaves, about one-fifth of the genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (143 out of 743) were also differentially methylated (DmC-DEG), but in roots the fraction was about one-third (75 differentially expressed genes, 21 of which were also differentially methylated). Gene ontology analysis detected stress response to abiotic stimulus, temperature, radiation, and light stimulus categories in roots. In leaves, the detected categories included response to stressors of temperature, radiation and light, plus chemical stress, oxidative stress and a response to oxygen-containing compounds. In addition, in leaves, a 46% of DmC-DEG set were associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggested that although DNA methylation may play a significant role in a portion of the genes regulated by spaceflight, it is clearly not the only factor in this regulation. Furthermore, ROS genes may play a unique role in the adaptation of plants to the spaceflight (Zhou et al., 2019).Furthermore, in “The Advanced Plant Experiment-04-Epigenetic Expression” experiment, launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 on 19 February 2017, two methylation mutant lines (met1-7andelp2-5) were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type (Col-0). The plants grew in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISEES chamber) with constant light conditions for 11 days, before being fixed in RNAlater into KFTs. Once on Earth, leaf and root tissues were dissected and, from each sample, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed (Table 2). The two mutant lines are deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation. MET1 (methyl transferase) is directly involved in the maintenance (particularly at CG sites) of cytosine methylation inArabidopsisand is an enzyme that modifies the epigenome, as part of stress responses. ELP2 (Elongator Protein) interacts with components of the siRNA machinery inducing cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 and is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses, playing a role in root development (Paul et al., 2021). The results reinforced that, in overall average, genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild type plants because, for Col-0 plants, the degree of the genome-wide methylation was not statistically significant between spaceflight and ground control samples. Instead, bothelp2-5andmit1-7plants were generally hypermethylated in spaceflight environment compared to the ground control. Each of the mutant lines demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. Inmet1-7plants, a large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves was observed (72 out of 226), whereas inelp2-5, the large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes (101 out of 120) was observed in roots, suggesting that MET1 plays a more important role in leaves and ELP2 in roots, in the process of physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The functional analysis showed that differential methylation took place inelp2-5line, together with the expression of gene classes that were associated with the spaceflight response in previous experiments, such as, metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses. Besides, these same spaceflight-associated processes were also among the primary classes enriched in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0. Conversely, the mutantmet1-7line showed relatively few GO term enrichments, predominantly associated with signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators. These data suggest thatmet1-7plants were better adapted to spaceflight thanelp2-5plants, and that the response to spaceflight environment acts more directly through mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through those regulated by MET1 (Paul et al., 2021).Epigenetic changes in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to spaceflight were studied by conducting a whole genome bisulfate sequencing to discover and qualitatively assess spaceflight-associated 5-methyl cytosine epigenetic modifications. In this experiment, 6- day-old Col-0 plants pre-cultured on ground were transferred to culture chambers aboard the Chinese recoverable scientific satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6 and landed on April 18, 2016) and after grown up to 60 h (2.5 days) under microgravity conditions, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater using a canal system and pump support system included in the equipment.The results demonstrated that lower methylation levels in CHG, CHH, and CpG context tended to occur under microgravity conditions. The molecular function analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) showed that they correspond to genes involved especially in hormone signaling pathways including auxin, ABA, ethylene, and brassinosteroids, genes encoding transcription factors (TF) and genes associated with cell wall metabolism. In addition to methylation alterations at the gene level, transposon elements (TE) showed altered methylation levels during spaceflight. Overall, these results indicate that alterations in the methylation of auxin-related genes and cell wall may play important roles in plants adaptation to microgravity and DNA demethylation within TEs may cause transcriptional alterations in transposons during adaptation to spaceflight conditions (Xu et al., 2018).Contrary to previous experiments that focus on studying the early adaptation response to the space environment, two Chinese missions whose results have been recently published, have focused on studying gene expression changes in the reproductive stage ofA. thalianaplants. Because successful completion of the plant seed-to-seed cycle was considered essential to support human life in long-term manned missions, the main objective of these two experiments was to examine how two different photoperiod conditions could affect flowering time under microgravity. (Wang et al., 2022;Xie et al., 2022). One of the experiments was carried out on board spacelab TG-2 (launched on September 15, 2016) in Plant Culture Box (PCB) hardware that controls the atmosphere, temperature, and hydrates the plants. Sterile seeds of WT (Col-0),pFT:GFPtransgenic plants andft-10were set on the panel root module containing commercially available vermiculite and stored dry until their hydration. The plants germinated and grew at 21°C under short-day (SD, 8h light/16h dark) or under long-day (LD, 16h light/8h dark) for 48 days, when one of LD PCBs withArabidopsisplants was taken out by an astronaut and fixed with the RNAlater solution for transcriptomics analysis (Table 2). The initiation of bolting (start of peduncle growth) was delayed under the LD condition on board spaceflight (42 days after sown in spaceflight and 25 days after sown on ground control). According to this result, FT expression occurred later under this light condition because in the ground control the GFP fluorescence reached peak levels at 22 days after sowing and in microgravity the fluorescence peak was reached at 43 days after sowing. The microarray analysis performed using the leaves of WT plants grown under LD revealed that 1793 genes were upregulated whereas there were 1669 downregulated genes in the spaceflight samples with respect to their corresponding ground control. Among the DEGs, 53 flowering genes were identified and classified according to their known or predicted function in the flowering regulation pathway. The data showed that FT expression was upregulated along with a few genes involved in photoperiodism and circadian clock whereas the expression of SOC1 decreased accompanied by the downregulation of key genes involved in the response to the photoperiod, circadian clock, vernalization, ambient temperature, gibberellins and aging. These results indicate for the first time that FT and SOC1 could be key genes forA. thalianaplants to integrate spaceflight condition stress signaling into flowering regulation pathways (Xie et al., 2022).The second experiment was carried out on the Chinese recoverable satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6, 2016). The plant growth system used consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing, heating, and humidity controlling system. TheA. thalianalines used were WT (Col-0) and transgenic plants (pHSP:FT,pHSP:GFPor FG) expressing FT together Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which it is possible to induce FT expression in-flight by heat shock treatment. The plants loaded in the growth chambers were germinated and grown in the root modules on ground under LD or SD conditions for 20 days, so they had about six to seven rosette leaves when the satellite was launched. After 12 days and 15 h in orbit, SJ-10 returned to Earth and 2 h after landing the plants were harvested and fixed with RNAlater solution (Table 2). As the images taken during the development of the experiment revealed, under the LD condition flowering occurred two days later in the space samples than in the ground controls for both the WT plants and the FG plants. In contrast, under the SD condition after heat shock treatment (37°C for 1h), in WT plants this delay was reduced to 1 day and in FG plants it disappeared, flowering both on ground and in space at 3 days. Microarray analysis was performed using the total RNA from leaves of WT and FG plants grown under LD and the SD in space and on ground, respectively. In the study of the categories of gene expression affected by spaceflight under different photoperiods, 4512 genes in WT and 4201 genes in FG response specifically to the LD or the SD (named \"daylength-related-sp\" or \"dl-sp\"). This higher number of “dl-sp” genes indicates that daylength is an important factor to regulate the response of plants to spaceflight. To further study response of plants to spaceflight after FT expression in the FG plants under the SD in comparison with WT plants, the authors compared the number of DEGs in response to spaceflight under the LD and the SD, respectively, among WT and FG samples. In these comparisons, they identified that 534 DEGS represented the group of genes in FG under the SD condition insensitive to spaceflight stress (unchanged in FG under the LD in space) and they were involved in cellular metabolic processes, as amino acid, amine, and oxoacid metabolic process.Conversely, the most sensitive genes to spaceflight in FG plants under the SD condition (was significantly altered only in this condition) were 467 DEGs, many of them related with abiotic stimulus response and post-translational protein modification. Finally, 251 DEGs with function in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and response to stimulus non-changed their expression in WT under SD. These transcriptomic results together with bolting times indicated that heat shock-induced FT expression in FG plants could be used as a gen switch for flowering induction in space, which could change the sensitivity to the abiotic stimulus and/or cellular metabolic processes and therefore, alter plant response to spaceflight (Wang et al., 2022).Gene expression changes in well-controlled environmental conditions including several light profiles and partial gravity levels (EMCS experiments)The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was another hardware facility aboard ISS which was used to grow plants on space. It provided directional light with white LEDs, controlled environment conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2, O2and ethylene concentration) and it was equipped with two centrifuges that allowed to incubate the samples at different levels of gravity, up to 2g. This allowed them to perform an on-board 1gcontrol, and also to incubate the samples at the so-called “partial gravity levels”, lower than 1g, such as those characterizing the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. In the TROPI-2 experiment (launched on space shuttle mission STS-130 in February 2010) WT seedlings ofArabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta(Ler) ecotype were grown for 6 days within the EMCS, and they were photostimulated with blue or red light at seven gravitational acceleration levels (μg, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53gand 1g) for the last 48h of the growth period. For seedling growth, photostimulation and video recording, samples were contained in special cassettes equipped with a hydration mechanism remotely operated, blue, red and white LEDs, which were used instead of the EMCS lighting system, and an “anti-fog” device that prevented water condensation from the cassette window. After the photostimulation phase, a crew member transferred samples from the EMCS to the to the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) facility for preservation until download. The ground control was performed in a laboratory incubator following the exact timeline and light treatments as the spaceflight experiment (Kiss et al., 2012). TROPI-2 experiment was a duplication of the original TROPI experiment after the problems experienced with the samples because of the presence of toxic volatile substances in the hardware (Table 3).Table 3.Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light condition and partial gravity levelsConditionsEcotypeFixationTissueAuthorsGLDS1gwhite light 4 days μg, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53gand 1gred light 2 daysLer-0Freeze −80°CSeedlingsCorrell et al.

See alsoTable S1.The primary objectives of the TROPI-2 experiment were to study plant tropisms in spaceflight (interaction between gravitropic and phototropic signals) using images, but samples from this experiment were also used to perform transcriptome analyses with RNA was extracted from whole seedlings, with the purpose of maximizing the scientific returns of the spaceflight experiment. The comparison between all spaceflight samples, regardless of their gravity or light treatment, with the 1gground samples, identified 280 genes that were differentially regulated. However, in the comparison of allg-treated spaceflight samples with microgravity samples, only 130 genes were identified as being differently regulated. From these genes, several of them were involved in cell polarity, cell defense or stress, and cell wall development. This result suggested that all of the spaceflight samples had a more similar environment because overall fewer number of genes were differentially expressed in the second comparison than in the first one, supporting the role that gravity plays in affecting these key developmental pathways, which were both represented in the two comparisons. In addition, as this hardware allowed performing a 1g-spaceflight control, these samples were compared with the 1gground control. This resulted in a large number of genes differentially regulated (230), many of them implicated in cell-wall development, cell polarity and oxygen responses, among other categories. The fact that the 1gspaceflightversus1gground samples revealed many genes with deregulated expression could be because of spaceflight effects other than microgravity (vibration, radiation exposure, etc), emphasizing the need for tissue fixation on board the ISS and better environmental monitoring tools to improve ground experiments (Correll et al., 2013).The Seedling Growth project (SG) was another plant space experiment performed in EMCS hardware, which consisted of three phases, each performed in different spaceflights: SG1 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-2 in March 2013), SG2 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-4 in September 2014) and SG3 (uploaded via SpaceX CRS-11 in June 2017). The goal of this project was to unraveling the link between the two main environmental cues driving plant development (light and gravity) at reduced gravity levels. Specifically, the project aimed at exploring if, and to what extent, specific light conditions could be applied to overcome, or at least to mitigate the deleterious effects caused by the lack of gravity on plant growth and development, thus facilitating the adaptation of plants to the space environment (Table 3). Ler seedlings grew under 6 nominal gravity levels (μg, 0.09gor low gravity, 0.18gor Moon gravity, 0.36gor Mars gravity, 0.57gor reduced Earth gravity, and 1.0g) illuminated under white light for 96h (4 days) followed by 48h (2 days) of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. The transcriptome analysis (RNAseq) of these samples revealed differential gene families affected and a clear difference in the intensity of the transcriptional response. At microgravity level photosynthesis, photosynthetic antenna proteins, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were downregulated pathways. Nevertheless, only two pathways, ribosome synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were found to be upregulated. These results suggested that a possible interplay between plant growth in microgravity and plastid function could exist (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). The analysis focused on partial gravity levels showed that as the gravity load increased the number of differentially expressed genes with respect to 1gcontrol decreased, with a remarkable exception of the low gravity level (lower than 0.1g), which is the one that resulted in the highest number of deregulated genes. The DEG number was 296 in microgravity, 568 in low gravity, 123 in Moon gravity, 19 in Mars gravity and only 2 genes in reduced Earth gravity. In addition, the functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis only identified enriched categories in μg, low-gand Moong-level, which were clearly different with the increasing partial-glevel. In microgravity, light and photosynthesis GO terms were enriched, whereas response to stress, response to chemicals, and response to hormones were enriched in low gravity and the more representative enrichment in Moon gravity was related to cell wall and membrane structure. The general stress response detected in low gravity level was explained as the consequence of competition between phototropism (blue light) and the weak gravitropism signal (0.09g) to be the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development, resulting in a stress for the plant. Instead, the existence of the gravitropic response along with blue light illumination seemed to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at Mars gravity level (Herranz et al., 2019).The SG project also studied by transcriptomic changes the adaptive response ofA. thalianaCol-0 seedlings grown at two nominal gravity levels (μgand Mars gravity level, or 0.3g). These samples were illuminated for 4 days in a long-day photoperiod (16h white light and 8h dark) and in the last 2 days of growth period half of them were photostimulated with red light and the other half were kept in darkness (Table 3). The results indicated that only in microgravity condition, both in darkness and under red light, elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression was observed, being probably associated with a disturbed retrograde and anterograde communication between these organelles and the nucleus. Furthermore, in this condition, genes involved in hormonal pathways that promote proliferation, such as auxin and cytokinin signal transduction, were activated. On the other hand, at Marsg-level genes of hormone pathways related with stress response (abscisic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid) were activated. Furthermore, upregulation of environmental acclimation-related transcriptions factors (WRKY and NACs families) was also observed, especially in samples grown at Mars gravity level and photostimulated with red light, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial gravity level are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes activated to cope with space environment-associated stress (Villacampa et al., 2021).Under these same growing conditions, two knockout lines of nucleolin protein,nuc1-2andnuc2-2, affecting the two variants of this gene inA.thaliana, were grown in the SG series spaceflight experiments. The use of the nucleolin mutants can significantly contribute to the knowledge of the plant response to spaceflight environment, because NUC1 protein occupies a central position in ribosome biogenesis regulation, a complex stress-sensitive process which has been found to be seriously altered under conditions of spaceflight. In addition,NUC1gene expression is known to be upregulated by red light on Earth. In turn, NUC2 protein participates in the mechanisms of adaptive responses to different stresses. First, transcriptome analysis was performed only with ground control samples with the purpose of knowing the response of nucleolin mutants to different illumination conditions, namely red light and darkness (Table 3). Under red light photostimulation, ribosome biogenesis was the most significantly enriched category within the upregulated genesin nuc1-2 versus nuc2-2. On seedlings kept in darkness during the last 2 days of cultivation, gene categories mainly involved in processes of cell division appeared promoted, and gene categories mainly related to developmental processes were downregulated innuc1-2seedlingsversusWT andnuc2-2seedlings. All these results indicate that on Earth the partial capability of theNUC2gene of replacing the functions ofNUC1gene in darkness, when this gene is not present, is enhanced by red light. Furthermore, this photoactivation induces in thenuc2-2mutant an increased expression of genes belonging to functional groups associated to stress response, which means that NUC2 protein has a greater capacity of response to environmental signals, such as illumination with red light, and therefore,nuc2-2plants cannot develop a full response to this stimulus. The results of this work bring out, in space-omics spaceflight experiments, the need to pay special attention to the ground reference controls because identifying the genetic background in the this condition is essential before conclusions can be made on the spaceflight results (Manzano et al., 2020).The “Plant Signaling” experiment, also carried out in the EMCS (launched in July 2011 aboard STS-135), studied the transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed for 5 days under continuous light at microgravity or partialg(0.53g, 0.65gand 0.88g) (Table 3). The analysis identified 101 genes whose expression levels were associated with gravity dose following three different patterns: increase or decrease expression in response to increasingglevels (dose-dependent linear response), peak or dip at an intermediateglevel (peak up or peak down response) and induced or repressed expression levels to a thresholdglevel (threshold response). In addition, the identification of the biological functions or pathways of these 101 fractional-gresponsive genes showed that they were genes involved in transcription regulation, chaperone function, cell wall and defense response. All of these categories had been previously described as being responsive to the plant response to the space environment (Sheppard et al., 2021).Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of other plant speciesThe molecular response to the long-term spaceflight environment of Mizuna plants was measured using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (mRNAseq). Seeds ofBrassica rapa var.nipposinica(Mizuna) were germinated and grown in Lada growth chambers aboard to Zvezda module of ISS. These chambers include a root module, leaf chamber and light module. After 27 days cultivation, the plants were harvested and stored at −80°C in the MELFI freezer. Once back on Earth, total RNA from leaves samples was extracted.The fresh weight and water content (spaceflight: 82.9g and 92.5%, ground control: 58.0g and 92.0%) showed that Mizuna plants grew as well or better under spaceflight environment than on the ground. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in space-grown plants a total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative markers were upregulated more than two-fold, including the major ROS-scavenging enzymes: thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. In addition, two ROS-producing genes (NADPH oxidase genes: RbohD and RbohF) were upregulated 3-fold and 5.1-fold, respectively. These findings suggest that the Mizuna plants can acclimate to long-term exposure in the spaceflight environment by reprogramming ROS gene network expression, producing ROS to maintain the activation of ROS signal network to control the defense system with ROS-scavenging system (Sugimoto et al., 2014).Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environment (Table S2)Arabidopsis thalianawild type semisolid callus cultures were exposed to spaceflight conditions for 5 days within the Simbox hardware on board the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou 8 (launched on October 31, 2011). The Simbox incubator enabled sample cultivation at controlled temperatures (22–24°C) and humidity (30–40%) and provided 1gin-flight control by means of an integrated centrifuge. In addition, this hardware included a pump system for metabolic quenching of the samples by RNAlater injection. The ground control experiment started with a one-day delay into the Simbox duplicate, according to the position in the flight incubator and kept at 23°C (Fengler et al., 2015) (Table 4). The microarray analysis detected 298 genes with differential expression between sample groups flight space (FS) and in-flight centrifugation (FC) but the differences in expression were not statistically significant. This result could mean that 5 days are enough for the culture adaptation to the new situation (spaceflight). Thus, in order to identify processes which are specifically influenced by microgravity and could provide important information about the physiological needs after a few days in space, overrepresented processes that were identical in the comparisons between FS samples and two 1gcontrols (in-flight centrifugation or FG and ground static or GS) were analyzed. Among the genes with upregulated expression, some of them constitute the ribosomal complex within plastids, and some others were genes involved in electron transport chains located within mitochondria and representative for ATP biosynthesis. Among the downregulated genes the largest group was shown to code for HSPs. These results indicated that 5 days of exposure to microgravity did not cause detectable significant changes in gene expression, but caused an increased energy demand which should be taken into consideration when plants will be used as part of bioregenerative supports on long duration space missions. Finally, with the aim to separate responses to microgravity from those of non-microgravity-related spaceflight conditions, genes that were significantly altered within spaceflight samples (FS and FC) compared to the 1gground control were studied. The majority of these genes were involved in the stress-induced antioxidant system, signaling chains, and defense-resistance response. The alteration of these processes was assumed as the effect of spaceflight-related environmental conditions, and especially, with the high radiation dose received by space samples (0.51 mSV/d), much more intense than terrestrial levels of radiation (1 to 2 mSV/a) (Fengler et al., 2015).Table 4.Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environmentConditionsOrganismFixationAuthorsGLDSSimboxμgdark 5 daysArabidpsis thaliana(Col-0)RNAlater (Simbox)Fengler et al.(2015)GLDS-213μgdark 324hOryza sativa(Rice)RNAlater (Simbox)Jin et al., 2018GLDS-284BRICμgdark 12 days parabolic flight simulated microgravity (2D clinorotation) simulated hypergravity (centrifuge)Arabidpsis thaliana(Col-0)RNAlater (PDFU)Paul et al.

See alsoTable S2.The aforementioned BRIC-16-DNA experiment also included the transcriptome analysis ofArabidopsis thalianatissue culture cells (Paul et al., 2012)(Table 4). One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) transcriptional activators genes in spaceflight non-differentiated tissue culture cells. Among these genes, the HsfA2 transcription factor which is involved in the late phases of heat stress response, and two of its targets: Hsp17.6A, that blocks protein aggregation, and Hsp101, that facilitates dissociation of already formed protein aggregates. In addition, the expression changes in these two HSP proteins, as markers of late stress response, were studied in parabolic flights (hypergravity and hypogravity alternation), in simulated microgravity (2D clinorotation) and in simulated hypergravity (centrifuge) by RT-qPCR. Among gravitational conditions examined, only 2D clinorotation induced the expression of both Hsp101 and HSP17.6A at the same levels as spaceflight. This fact suggests that hypergravity forces experienced at the space shuttle launch do not contribute to the elevated level of HSP transcripts in spaceflight samples. Therefore, a unique feature of microgravity engages HSPs as part of a later-phase adaptive response to spaceflight conditions, probably associated with the role played by them in cytoskeletal organization, preventing cytoskeletal scaffold collapse in a non-gravity environment (Zupanska et al., 2013).The Cellular Expression Logic, or CEL BRIC-17 experiment, was a modification of the previousArabidopsiscell cultures experiment in BRIC-16. In this experiment, launched on SpaceX CRS-2 to the ISS on 1 March 2013, besides the WT cell line, two mutant lines were used: ARG1 KO and HSFA2 KO (Zupanska et al., 2017,2019). The knockout line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 was selected for the role of this protein in gravisignaling, whereas the knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 was selected because this protein is a key regulator of the defense response, via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation, to several types of environmental stresses (Table 4). The transcriptome analysis, after 10 days on orbit, showed that both mutant cell lines used substantially more and different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation led to conclude that a proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network and functional ARG1 protein. The functional gene categorization revealed that, although individual genes were different in each expression set, those genes were largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting slightly different routes, which appeared to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. In addition, most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to beArg1-andHsfA2-dependent. Specifically, these genes were involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport and starch biosynthesis, suggesting major and specific roles of these two proteins in the physiological spaceflight adaptation through these processes. Overall, this study showed up that the use of knockout lines greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment. This amplifies the information that is necessary to learn on what biological processes are necessary and what genes are involved in these processes (Zupanska et al., 2017,2019).Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to simulated space environments (Table S3)Cell cultures ofArabidopsis thalianawere exposed to partial-gforces (0.16g, 0.38gand 0.5g) for different times during parabolic flight (24 s, 33 s and 20 s) and clinostat experiments (5 min, 10 min and 30 min), in order to investigate gravity-dependent alterations in gene expression by whole-genome microarray analysis (Fengler et al., 2016) (Table 5). The results revealed that, in simulation by clinorotation, the least effects (the lowest number of differentially expressed genes at least 2-fold) were obtained after 30 min at 0.5g. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering (Pearson`s Correlation Coefficient) suggested that, in the clinorotation experiment, gene expression was more affected by the exposure time than by the change in gravity, because 0.16g, 0.38gand 0.5ggenerated no separate cluster for a given time of exposure and, interestingly, under 30 min of exposure, all gravity levels clustered with 1gcontrols. Although the clustering illustrated a low similarity between real (parabolic flight) and simulated partial-g, the screening at the single gene level identified many common differentially expressed genes, mainly at 0.38g. Among them, genes coding for proteins involved in cell wall modifications, peroxidases, auxin-related proteins, transmembrane proteins and components of intracellular signaling chains like different protein kinases, transcription factors and phytohormone-related proteins were identified. Taken together this study suggests that, after 30 min of clinorotation, specific responses are fading, demonstrating the insusceptibility of cell cultures over time and that clinorotation can induce changes in levels of transcripts similar to flight experiments (Fengler et al., 2016).Table 5.Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to simulated space environmentsConditionsOrganismFixationAuthorsGLDSParabolic flight 2D Clinostat0.16g, 0.38gand 0.5gdark 5min, 10min and 30minArabidpsis thaliana(Col-0)RNAlater Freeze (liquid nitrogen)Fengler et al.

See alsoTable S3.In another work, callus semi-solid cultures ofA. thaliana, prepared from MM2d suspension cultures, were exposed for 200 min to two paradigms of simulated microgravity (a mechanical one, the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and diamagnetic levitation) and hypergravity (the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC)). Five environments with different levels of effective gravity (g) and magnetic field (B) strengths within a magnet (μg∗B = 10.1 T, 0,1g∗ B = 14.7 T, 1g∗ B = 16.5 T, 1.9g∗ B = 14.7 T and 2g∗ B = 10.1 T) and samples exposed to RPM simulated microgravity (μg) and hypergravity (2g) in the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) were compared (Manzano et al., 2012) (Table 5). The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. Microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed (not reaching statistical significance) when exposed to these unusual environments compared with internal 1gcontrols (particularly because of the large effect of high-energy magnetic field). However, using a detailed analysis based on clustering of similarly expressed genes (Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector-GEDI) it was found that gravitational and magnetic fields had a synergistic effect on the transcriptional profile because both the number of altered genes and the GO groups affected increased when a magnetic field gradient was applied, mainly affecting structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes. In fact, it is the first study in which a 0.1g partial gravity samples show larger effects that those observed in the equivalent simulated microgravity sample under the same environmental condition. The GEDI analysis also revealed that, there is a global signature, specifically including abiotic stress genes, that behave in an opposite manner under micro and hypergravity environments (Manzano et al., 2012).Plant cell proliferation is a process known to be affected during spaceflight, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these changes remain unclear. To investigate transcriptomic changes in cell cycle regulation and progression by simulated microgravity, anArabidopsisimmobilized suspension culture was incubated in the RPM. Particularly, the analysis was performed with two synchronous subpopulations, enriched in G2/M and G1 phases, incubated for respectively 7 h and 14 h within the RPM, and an asynchronous reference cell culture incubated for 14h (Kamal et al., 2019) (Table 5). The results showed that the number of differentially expressed genes common in all populations by the simulated microgravity environment was low: 73 genes were upregulated, mostly being NADH/oxidative activity-related genes and mitochondria-related functions, and 83 genes were downregulated, most of them involved in ribosome activity and in photosynthesis-related functions. Conversely, simulated microgravity had differential effects on gene expression through the cell cycle progression. The expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation function, cell organization, ribosome biogenesis and developmental processes were downregulated in the G2/M population and upregulated in the G1 population, whereas abiotic stress response genes were upregulated in the G2/M population and downregulated significantly in the G1 population. Among the genes involved in abiotic stress response, genes that respond to UV-B, heat, osmotic shock and wounding are upregulated in synchronous G2/M population, but they were repressed in the synchronous G1 culture after 14 h of incubation in the RPM. These differential patterns of gene expression of stress pathways suggest differential sensitivity to microgravity of different phases of the cell cycle. It was proposed that a rapid initial response to a new environment within the first 7 h occurs mainly through the activation of expression of stress-related genes, whereas, at 14h of incubation, the gene expression patterns change as a result of a longer-term adaptive strategy that inhibits those pathways (Kamal et al., 2019).Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of cell cultures from other speciesCeratopteris richardiispores were exposed to microgravity aboard NASA shuttle flight STS-93 to identify the early cellular and molecular events associated with gravity signal perception and response. These fern single-cells have been particularly valuable for investigating how cells sense and respond to gravity because this signal orients the polarity of their development shortly after light initiates their germination. The spores remained dormant in darkness inside BRIC canisters until the gravity force was less than 0.001g, and then were exposed to ambient light in the mid-deck to induce germination. After light exposure at three developmental time points (1 h, 8 h and 20 h) spores were frozen in a gaseous nitrogen freezer and were kept frozen until total RNA was isolated (Table 4). Microarray analysis showed that genes likely to encode peroxidases are downregulated in spaceflight development whereas protein phosphatase 2C and chaperone expression were upregulated in spores during the first 20 h of their germination in microgravity. Moreover, genes that may be involved in mobilization of reserve lipids were upregulated in spaceflight and genes whose products are likely involved in lipid hydrolysis/synthesis/transfer showed reduced mRNA levels during development in microgravity. These results, taken together, suggest that in microgravity lipids utilization and stress response changes occur in ferns and may be common features of spaceflight response in plant cells. Moreover, these findings provided new insights into early physiological responses to microgravity and are valuable data unraveling the basis genetic mechanisms that drive single-cell gravity responses (Salmi and Roux, 2008).The spaceship Shenzhou mission also included one experiment to study gene expression in rice calli in response to microgravity. Rice calli (Oryza sativa) were loaded onto the stationary and rotating platforms of Simbox incubator and were fixed in RNAlater in space after 324h (13,5 days) spacecraft flight (Table 4). The functional analysis identified that the microgravity-response transcripts were associated with metabolism and signaling pathways of hormones, transcription factors, starch, glycolysis and the electron chain, protein degradation, transporters and cell wall metabolism. Among cell wall-related genes, genes related to cell wall formation/degradation were downregulated and transcripts corresponded to proteins involved in primary cell wall modification were upregulated. In addition, genes of the aquaporin family (water channels) were upregulated in spaceflight environment. The changed levels of these cell wall loosening and cell wall precursor synthesis-related genes together with aquaporin genes may establish of a new balance between cell wall rigidity and cell turgor pressure under microgravity conditions. Therefore, cell wall relaxation and extension may be regarded as microgravity plants adaptation (Jin et al., 2018)."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized byDarwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism,Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism,Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectivelyBriggs 1964;Vandenbrink et al. 2014a,b;Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism,Chen et al. 1999;Kiss 2000) among others. Tropisms are important for plants, which as sessile organisms, utilize these movements to respond to external stimuli (Kaufman et al. 1987;Whippo and Hangarter 2004). Typically, in ground studies, plants respond to blue-light photostimulation positively (growth towards the light) in shoots, and negatively (growth away from the light source) in roots (Kutschera and Briggs 2012;Briggs 2014;Liscum et al. 2014). Recently, a positive red-light-based phototropic response in roots mediated by phytochromes has been observed and characterized (Kiss et al. 2003;Molas and Kiss 2008), in addition to positive hypocotyl phototropic response to red light in the conditions of microgravity (Millar et al. 2010). However, the magnitude of phototropic response is less during red-light stimulation compared with the robust response to blue light. In terms of gravitropic response, in general, plants respond to the gravity vector by growing roots in the direction of gravity, and shoots opposite of the gravity vector. The amalgamation of tropistic movements results in the overall direction and form of plant growth (Correll and Kiss 2002).Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978;Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008;Silva-Navas et al. 2015).To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified inArabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003;Kiss et al. 2003;Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004;Kumar et al. 2008).The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010;Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector.While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g;Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g,and 1genvironments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g,and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism."

        "Title": "Light and gravity signals synergize in modulating plant development",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.\nKeywords:\ngravitropism, phototropism, phytochromes, auxin, meristematic cells, cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, space biology",

The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions.\nMaterials and Methods:\nHere, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of\nArabidopsis thaliana\nwere germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-\ng\n, several intermediate partial-\ng\nlevels, and 1\ng\n, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.\nResults:\nDifferential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-\ng\n, low-\ng\nlevel (< 0.1\ng\n) or the Moon\ng\n-level with 1\ng\ncontrol conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon\ng\n-level and increased in the intermediate\ng\n-level (< 0.1\ng\n), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each\ng\n-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-\ng\n, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon\ng\n-level.\nDiscussion:\nTranscriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-\ng\nlevel, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.\nKeywords:\nArabidopsis, fractional gravity, microgravity, stress response, RNA-Seq, spaceflight",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionLong-term exploration of the Solar System will require that humans travel within a nearly close life-support systems, reducing to the minimum the amount of water, oxygen, and nutrients to be transported and optimizing the recycling of reusable waste. Such a system is being under development, for example, in the Melissa project from the European Space Agency (Godia et al., 2004), but it will require an edible plant to be successfully cultivated in the environmental conditions expected to be achieved during spaceflight and on arrival at nearby objects. Isolation chambers could avoid, at least partially, some of the suboptimal environmental conditions that can greatly compromise organism adaptation to spaceflight (Beckingham, 2010), including temperature, radiation, air, and soil composition constrains. However, providing artificial gravity will require large diameter centrifuge (Van Loon et al., 2008) or even expensive railroad-based platforms that could be subjected to other biological limitations.Gravity influences the direction of plant growth and the pattern of development, from seedlings to adult plants (Volkmann and Baluska, 2006), and even gravitational effects onin vitroplant cell cultures have been reported (Babbick et al., 2007;Barjaktarovic et al., 2007). Light is the only tropistic response that plays a substantial role in determining overall plant architecture with a contribution similar to gravity. Typically, plants orient their roots towards the gravity vector (positive gravitropic response), and away from blue/white light exposure (negative phototropic response). Shoots show the opposite orientation, growing away from the gravity vector (negative gravitropic response) and towards a blue/white light source (positive phototropic response;Kutschera and Briggs, 2016;Briggs, 2014;Chen et al., 1999). Any tropistic response is divided into three stages; perception, transduction and response. During the perception phase, starch-filled statoliths interact with other cellular components in the specialized columella cells. Once the gravity signal is perceived, a differential auxin gradient develops along the root to the root elongation zone (transduction stage), where differential plant growth occurs and leads to reorientation of the root in the direction of the gravity vector (reviewed inVandenbrink et al., 2014).Phototropism and gravitropism have been well characterized, but little was known about the interaction among tropisms until recently. Experiments with plants in microgravity have allowed for the study of phototropism in the absence of the influence of gravity (Kiss, 2015). Our previous research showed that light perception by the roots can have an effect on shoot gravitropism inArabidopsis thaliana(Hopkins and Kiss, 2012). In addition, phototropic curvature of roots in response to unilateral blue light was tied to the magnitude of the gravity vector (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This latter study also identified an association between red-light-based phototropism in roots and the magnitude of the gravity vector. Other experiments involving assays of cell growth and cell proliferation have demonstrated that there is an imbalance between these key plant development functions in microgravity (Matía et al., 2010) in dark-grown plants. Recent spaceflight results also demonstrated that red light can compensate this effect (Valbuena et al., 2018), particularly increasing cell growth (i.e., as assayed by ribosome biosynthesis in the nucleolus) that was depleted without light stimulation.Studies on the response of living organisms to altered gravity are greatly facilitated by the development of ground-based facilities for simulation of gravity alterations to perform basic science as well as to design and prepare for space experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). The biological system (cell proliferation and growth during early plant development) had previously been studied under real microgravity in the ISS (Driss-Ecole et al., 2008;Matía et al., 2010;Mazars et al., 2014). Similar effects to the ones observed during spaceflight (increased cell proliferation rates together with decreased cell growth parameters) also were observed in root meristem cells in simulated microgravity studies (Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016;Valbuena et al., 2018) and in two partial-gparadigms. The imbalance of the cell proliferation and cell growth rates is also observable at the Moon´s gravity level, while less pronounced effects were observed at Marsglevel (Kamal et al., 2018;Manzano et al., 2018).In terms of spaceflight transcriptional experiments, a number of studies performed in orbit are available in public databases (Paul et al., 2012;Paul et al., 2013;Johnson et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017). In these studies, some Gene Ontology categories as responses to biotic or abiotic stress, oxidative stress, cell wall reorganization and secondary metabolism remodeling commonly show the highest variation in gene expression. Transcriptional response in microgravity is different in each experiment, due to both the biological material (developmental stage or organ analyzed) and the technical/environmental constraints of each spaceflight experiment [late or early access to the sample during spaceflight, the hardware used, type of dissection/fixation/preservation see for example (Kruse et al., 2017)].In a previous report, we focused on the effects of microgravity in the transcriptional profile of blue-light photostimulated seedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Here, we will describe the plant transcriptional response to several partial gravity levels in young blue-light photostimulatedA. thalianaseedlings cultivated into the European Module Cultivation System (EMCS) centrifuge on board the International Space Station (ISS). The results from plants cultivated on the ISS within the SEEDLING GROWTH experiment series illustrate the adaptation strategy of plants at the level of the whole transcriptome to cope with reduced gravity conditions."

        "Title": "Comparison of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight in Studies of Plant Growth and Development",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLife on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1-\ng\nenvironment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects\nvia\nspaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.\nKeywords:\nArabidopsis\n, clinostat, plant growth, simulated microgravity, random positioning machine, reduced gravity, spaceflight experiments",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants have evolved under the influence of Earth'’s gravity, a force of “1g.” This ubiquitous force affects plant growth, development, and morphology at all levels, from the molecular to the whole plant (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). In addition, gravity underlies other physical phenomena like buoyancy, convection, and sedimentation, which affect many physical and chemical processes and therefore also shape plant growth and development. For example, buoyancy affects gas exchange, cellular respiration, and photosynthesis, but itself is a function of varying densities (Braun et al., 2018).Studying the direct and indirect effects of gravity on plant growth, however, is complicated by the difficulty of changing gravity on Earth. One means of reducing gravity'’s influence is to establish free fall and eliminate the effect of gravity either for a few seconds in so-called drop towers and parabolic flights or for the long term by using orbital free fall, which creates weightlessness. This condition is achieved by the balance between Earth'’s gravity and the velocity required to maintain free fall (Kiss, 2015). Experiments focusing on plant growth and development have been carried out in this environment almost from the advent of human spaceflight in the 1960s (Wolverton and Kiss, 2009;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016).Fascinating insights into plant biology have been provided by spaceflight studies aboard orbiting spacecraft. For instance, at the cell/molecular level, changes in the cell cycle (Manzano et al., 2009;Matía et al., 2010) and the cell wall (Soga et al., 2002;Johnson et al., 2015) have been observed when plants develop in microgravity. Recently, there have been a plethora of spaceflight experiments on the effects of varying gravity levels on gene expression in plants (Paul et al., 2012;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Paul et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). And facilitated by the absence of significant gravitational accelerations in spaceflight, novel mechanisms of phototropism (Molas and Kiss, 2009) have been discovered in flowering plants (Millar et al., 2010;Kiss et al., 2012;Vandenbrink et al., 2016). On the applied side of plant space research, there has also been progress on cultivating plants for use in bioregenerative life support systems (Braun et al., 2018).Because of the scarcity of access to spaceflight, researchers have used other approaches to minimize or eliminate constant 1-gconditions (Kiss, 2015). These methods include drop towers (samples are weightlessness for seconds), parabolic flights in specialized airplanes (samples are weightlessness for approximately 10–20 s), and sounding rockets (minutes of weightlessness) as attractive alternatives (see alsoBeysens and van Loon, 2015). Sounding rockets are retrieved in the same general area after their launch without entering into orbit. In the free-fall phase, these missions typically provide 3–8 min of microgravity (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). In recent years, private companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are promising suborbital flight with several minutes of microgravity (Pelton, 2019). However, for most systems in plant biology, these suborbital methods provide a period of weightlessness that is too short to effectively assay growth and development. A conceptual alternative to these methods of creating brief free-fall conditions is to develop conditions in which the direction of the gravity vector is constantly changing through the use of clinostats and similar devices."

        "Abstract": "Graphical Abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace exploration will soon include new human missions to the Moon as a first step in the human exploration of Mars. Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study,Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions,Beheshti et al., 2019;Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts.Due to their sessile condition, plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. On the one hand, light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator TOR kinase through the expression of S-phase genes, and also ribosome biogenesis (Caldana et al., 2013;Xiong et al., 2013;Sablowski and Carnier Dornelas, 2014). In addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development, by means of phototropism and photomorphogenesis. In playing this role, light is associated with gravity as one of the major tropistic cues, such that gravitropism and phototropism (and the interaction between them) are essential modulators of plant development (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). At the cellular and molecular levels, plant development relies on the activity of cell growth and proliferation taking place in the meristems, which supply differentiated cells and are influenced by the tropistic cues (Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010).Darkness is indeed a stress condition for plants. Several articles describe that in the dark, apical meristem proliferation is arrested in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (López-Juez et al., 2008;Mohammed et al., 2017), but in the root meristem, light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). This reduction could be related to the sugar starvation that results from the inability to perform photosynthesis.However, red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. An increase in the mitotic index, in the expression of some regulators of these processes at both gene expression and protein levels, and in post-translational modifications of some protein factors has been described in plants irradiated with red light (Tong et al., 1997;Reichler et al., 2001).The absence of gravity (weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free-fall, or in spaceflight) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants, and specifically for the functions of meristematic cells (Matía et al., 2010;Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). An experiment performed in the International Space Station (ISS) in whichArabidopsis thalianaseedlings grew for 4 days in darkness resulted in an increase in the rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in the cell growth rate, estimated by the activity of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, compared with the 1gcontrol (Matía et al., 2010). As the coordination of these two activities defines meristematic competence, the effect of the lack of tropistic stimuli, particularly of gravity signals, may result in serious alterations of the developmental pattern of the plant, as was also shown in simulated microgravity experiments (Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016).The Seedling Growth (SG) experiments, recently performed in the ISS, aimed at unraveling the link between phototropism and gravitropism, using the weightless environment of spaceflight (Vandenbrink et al., 2019;Herranz et al., 2019). In the first SG experiment,A. thalianaseedlings corresponding to wild-type (WT) ecotypeLandsberg erecta(Ler) and two phytochrome mutants (phyAandphyB) known to be involved in phototropism (Kiss et al., 2003;Molas and Kiss, 2008) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days, revealing differential blue and red light phototropism in space (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). The analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth caused by microgravity in darkness (Matía et al., 2010) and, consequently, a compensation of the loss of meristematic competence (Valbuena et al., 2018).In view of these results from our previous space experiments, we decided to focus on the cellular process of ribosome biogenesis for the successive spaceflight experiments of the SG project, with the purpose of testing the separate and synergistic effects of the light and gravity tropistic signals on specific molecular and cellular components of this process. Ribosome biogenesis, which takes place in the nucleolus, represents the most complex multi-step process that the cell must perform and is one of the most intricately regulated and controlled (Sáez-Vásquez and Medina, 2008;Pelletier et al., 2018). Therefore, its regulation must adapt to the environmental conditions in which the cell finds itself and coordinate with other cellular processes, such as cell division and differentiation. Several studies have described and used the nucleolus as a major stress sensor, using stress-induced changes in the organization and composition of this organelle (Mayer and Grummt, 2005;Boulon et al., 2010;Lewinska et al., 2010;Kalinina et al., 2018).Briefly, ribosome biogenesis consists of the transcription of 45S rRNA genes (45S rDNA) containing the sequences of 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, followed by the multi-step cleavage of 45S pre-rRNA to produce, in association with 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (RPs), the mature ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm and assembled as mature ribosomes.In addition to RPs, hundreds of non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs), or nucleolar proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are required for ribosome biogenesis, playing regulatory roles (Sáez-Vásquez and Delseny, 2019). Among NRPs, nucleolin is the most abundant protein of the nucleolus, where it plays a key role in the different steps involved in ribosome biogenesis, including RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription, processing of pre-rRNA (Ginisty et al., 1999;Roger et al., 2003), and assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosome particles (Bouvet et al., 1998). Moreover, nucleolin has been even implicated in other functions, with or without collateral relationship with ribosome biogenesis (Angelov et al., 2006;Ma et al., 2007;Mongelard and Bouvet, 2007;Stepiński, 2012).Animal and yeast genomes encode a single nucleolin gene, whereas plants offer various examples of gene multiplicity. InA. thaliana, two genes encoding nucleolin proteins have been described:NUC1andNUC2(Pontvianne et al., 2007,2010). TheNUC1gene is highly and ubiquitously expressed in normal growth conditions and NUC1 protein is required to inhibitNUC2gene expression at the transcriptional level and may also influence the accumulation of NUC2 protein. In contrast,NUC2is a functional protein-coding gene developmentally controlled in most plant tissues and organs (Durut et al., 2014). NUC1 and NUC2 proteins localize in the nucleolus.Disruption ofNUC1gene (nuc1-2mutant) leads to severe defects in plant growth and development. At the molecular level, this mutant producesNUC2expression, nucleolus disorganization, rDNA (NOR) heterochromatin decondensation, pre-rRNA accumulation, de-repression of specific rDNA variants, and de-methylation of some sequences of rDNA (Pontvianne et al., 2010).In contrast, disruption ofNUC2gene (nuc2-2mutant) has much weaker effects. Thenuc2-2mutant seedlings grow quite similarly to WT plants, but flowering occurs later. Knockout of theNUC2gene induces expression of some rDNA variants and hypermethylation of some sequences of pre-rRNA. In addition, NUC2 is required for the stability of rDNA variants' copy number (Durut et al., 2014).In this article, in a series of ground studies to complement space experiments, we have exposedA. thaliana(ecotype Columbia) WT,nuc1-2andnuc2-2seedlings to two different illumination regimes at the beginning of the plant development (6 days from germination). In addition to highlighting the importance of Earth reference controls in spaceflight -omics experiments, our goal was to better understand the responses of nucleolin mutants to red light stimulation for further uses in space experiments under altered gravity conditions. The differential adaptive responses to the light are shown, suggesting that stress-related mutants may show a reduced response to environmental stress. In the long term, these results may lead to more efficient agriculture if an exaggerated response may reduce plant development under suboptimal environmental conditions."

This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of\nWolffia globosa\n(commonly known as “\nwater lentils\n” or “\nduckweed\n”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of\nWolffia globosa\nplants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of\nWolffia globosa\nas a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.\nSubject terms:\nPlant sciences, Light responses, Photosynthesis, Plant development",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWolffia globosa, commonly known as “water lentils” is a member of theWolffoideaesubfamily within theLemnaceaefamily, shares similar biological traits with itsLemnoideaerelatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2. Due to its rapid growth rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food production, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered attention also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate7, offering traits that align with closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop8. Nevertheless, as for other candidate space crops9,10to assess the suitability ofWolffia’sin space cultivation and its ability to recycle resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme conditions are fundamental7.Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their interactions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and costly7,11. Space limitations within onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of replicates, making studies under these conditions even more demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the gravitational vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experiments involving different gravity levels18,19.Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in space exploration, affecting humans, and plant life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can influence various aspects of plant biology and growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational conditions24,25.Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology inWolffiaplants26, possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off, landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability ofWolffiaplants under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their potential7.Recent genome sequencing ofWolffia australianahas shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and photomorphogenesis inWolffiaplants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister speciesWolffia australiana, we also hypothesised forWolffia globosaa lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics.More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology ofWolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges, we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidatingWolffia globosa's responses to these diverse gravity environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013–2018). Different\ng\n-levels were used, with special attention to micro-\ng\n, Mars-\ng\n, and Earth-\ng\n. In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different\ng\n-levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars\ng\n-level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial-\ng\nare able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.\nKeywords:\nlight, microgravity, plant growth, root meristem, spaceflight, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWe have recently commemorated the 50th anniversary of the first time that a human being stepped on the surface of the Moon, the first terrestrial body outside the Earth in receiving humans. Nowadays, fifty years after Astronaut Armstrong’s epic achievement, space exploration by humans is commonly recognized as an exciting and attractive challenge and a powerful booster for scientific and technological progress in order to improve human life on Earth [1]. This is true despite some minor criticisms that question the high costs that it entails [2].The establishment of permanent settlements in the Moon and Mars is becoming a realistic possibility in the near future. After a decade of successful rover explorations to the surface of Mars [3], both ESA and NASA, and more recently, the agencies from growing economies in Asian countries, are working to promote a human mission, first to the Moon, and then to Mars.The objectives of deep space exploration by humans, including of the Moon and Mars, require the implementation of a complex system of life support for space explorers, capable of supplying the elements necessary for sustaining their life (oxygen, food, moisture, etc.) and of removing their waste products. The system needs to be bioregenerative, i.e., the components need to self-regenerate without the addition of new elements brought from Earth, and energy-efficient, only using the power sources available in space.Plants are a candidate to occupy a key position in these bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). They are indeed being used in all the initiatives tested currently, such as MELiSSA—Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative [4,5]. There is no doubt that plants must accompany humans in space exploration ventures, because they offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the psychological wellbeing of the crew during long-duration missions in space.The achievement of a true “space agriculture” is a fundamental objective of this global enterprise, and the advances in this task are already producing substantial benefits for the efficiency and sustainability of the terrestrial agriculture [6,7]. The existence of “Martian greenhouses” is an image that appears to be more common to the public eye. In these greenhouses, plants could be provided with the necessary environmental elements to enable their development. These elements include light, water, temperature, oxygen, CO2, and aeration, in addition, obviously, to a substrate in which to anchor, from which the plant will take nutrients through its roots. Apart from anchoring the root, the substrate (e.g., soil) has to be capable of sustaining root development. Some published experiments have demonstrated that terrestrial plants can grow in an analogue of lunar soil or Martian soil, provided that this substrate is supplemented with additional elements and substances that provide the plant with the water, mineral salts, and nutrients that it needs for its survival and development [8]. Recently, plants have been grown in real Lunar regoliths brought back by Apollo missions, showing that the Lunar regolith is capable of supporting plant growth; however, it is not certainly the best substrate, because some stress was generated in samples grown on it [9].In addition to the issues originated by the alien soils and the supply of the environmental conditions required for the growth of terrestrial plants, two important adverse factors need to be counteracted. These are the gravity level, different from the Earth value (microgravity—near 0g—in orbit, 0.17gfor the Moon surface, and 0.38gfor the Mars surface) and the existence of cosmic radiation. These two are the only environmental factors that are unavoidable and unable to be counteracted using technological solutions or elements available on Earth. Moreover, plants have not encountered these conditions throughout their evolutionary history. Thus, the cultivation of plants in spaceflight, as well as on the Moon and Mars, requires that the specimens to be cultivated become adapted to grow and develop in the presence of these two environmental factors. To achieve this objective, we first need a full understanding of the biological mechanisms of response and adaptation to conditions of the spaceflight environment. Obviously, the development of technological countermeasures or the use of biological strategies that would mitigate the unfavorable impact of gravity and radiation is a complementary strategy to consider."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nReduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.\nKeywords:\natrophy, disuse, skeletal muscle, nNOS, oxidative stress, FoxO3a",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nContractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the\nSod2\n(MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the\nSod2\n(MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart.\nKey Words:\nAging, Heart, Superoxide dismutase, Oxidative stress, Fibrosis.",

        "Title": "Lifelong wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction attenuate nuclear EndoG in the aging plantaris muscle.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nApoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11 weeks:\nad libitum\nfeeding until 6 mo. (YAL); fed\nad libitum\nuntil 24 mo. old (OAL); 8%CR to 24 mo. (OCR); WR + 8%CR to 24 mo. (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (−38%) and WR with CR (−46%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (−63%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (−49%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.\nKeywords:\nEndoG, HSP27, aging, caloric restriction, wheel running, exercise",

In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed\nad libitum\n(OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed\nad libitum\n(YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.\nKeywords:\nSarcopenia, Aging Muscle, Calorie Restriction, Exercise, Wheel Running, Sarcolemma",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSkeletal muscle is crucial for stability, mobility and whole body metabolism. As with all other organs, aging has a detrimental impact on skeletal muscle that can be observed phenotypically as atrophy, susceptibility to damage, fibrosis, and weakness. This age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is often referred to as “sarcopenia.” Sarcopenia occurs in rodents and humans (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002;Kim and others 2008;Lushaj and others 2008;Rice and others 2006). In the human population sarcopenia affects up to 25% of humans that are 65 years and older, and greater than 40% of the population that is ≥ 80 years old (Iannuzzi-Sucich and others 2002). The affect that sarcopenia has on muscle function is clinically important, exemplified by increased susceptibility to muscle fatigue and weakness that lead to a higher risk of fall-related injuries (Marzetti and Leeuwenburgh 2006;Metter and others 2002). With mean lifespan continuing to increase, finding treatments and interventions to slow the process or lessen the impact of sarcopenia on health and quality of life are of critical importance.The plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells, commonly referred to as the sarcolemma, relies on binding of the sarcolemmal scaffolding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for proper membrane integrity. Sarcolemmal scaffolding is manifested as costameres, which are comprised of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and integrin/focal adhesion complexes (Clark and others 2002;Davies and Nowak 2006;Grounds and others 2005). Damage to the sarcolemmal environment can lead to a reduced ability to sense and respond to dynamic changes in mechanical stimuli. Indeed, impairment of sarcolemmal scaffolding and signaling promotes myofiber fragility and leads to overall muscle weakness and limited mobility (Grounds and others 2005;Wu and others 2011). The sarcolemma is increasingly prone to mechanically-induced damage in aged muscle (Faulkner and others 1995). Intriguing observations indicate that compromised integrity of the sarcolemma in conjunction with diminished mechano-signaling contributes to sarcopenia (Ramaswamy and others 2011;Rice and others 2006). For instance, in skeletal muscle from very old mice, sarcolemmal dystrophin becomes discontinuous and elicits decreased membrane integrity and lateral force transmission through the Z-disc to the extracellular matrix (Ramaswamy and others 2011;Rice and others 2006). These findings indicate that muscular dystrophic-like DGC disruptions occur in aging muscle.In various forms of muscular dystrophy, where there is a deficit in sarcolemmal integrity and force transmission, membrane repair proteins are found to be increased compared to muscles from controls (Cagliani and others 2005;Ramaswamy and others 2011). Mechanical and/or biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) stressors can damage the sarcolemma and induce the membrane repair response. Shortly after the damage-inducing event, the membrane repair response occurs in a coordinated fashion, mitsugumin-53 (MG53) is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2 (Cai and others 2009;Roostalu and Strahle 2012). While little is known about the relationship between sarcopenia and cell membrane repair, a similar repair response may be occurring in aged muscle as in the dystrophic muscles. Similar to the various forms of muscular dystrophy, aging is accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress and susceptibility to damage – possibly triggering and contributing to the altered sarcolemmal environment.Skeletal muscle wasting associated with aging is postulated to be due in part to increased levels of oxidative stress (Fulle and others 2004;Kim and others 2008;Ryan and others 2008). In skeletal muscle, there are several oxidant producing sources (Bejma and Ji 1999;Reid 2001), and while many studies have examined the role of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging skeletal muscle (Melov 2000;Van Remmen and Jones 2009), further examination of non-mitochondrial sources of superoxide is needed. NADPH oxidase (Nox) protein complexes have been found in skeletal muscle, with the Nox2 isoform serving as a major source of superoxide generation during contractile activity (Khairallah and others 2012;Pearson and others 2014;Sakellariou and others 2013). In healthy muscle, contractile-induced activity of the membrane-localized Nox2 is crucial for redox signaling and upregulation of cytoprotective functions after cessation of contractions. However, inmdxmice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nox2 becomes hypersensitive to stretch while Nox2 abundance and activity are elevated, thus exacerbating disease pathology (Whitehead and others 2010). Although recent Nox2 findings in aged skeletal muscle remain inconclusive (Barrientos and others 2015;Nyberg and others 2014;Ryan and others 2010), it is an intriguing possibility that alterations in Nox2 may contribute to the age-associated reduction in membrane integrity.Habitual or lifelong exercise training can limit the rate of sarcopenia (Kim and others 2008;Lawler and Hindle 2011). We have previously demonstrated that lifelong wheel running and mild caloric restriction attenuated age-associated muscle fiber atrophy (Kim and others 2008). However, the effects of lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise on the sarcolemmal environment (i.e., DGC, membrane repair proteins, Nox2) are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate (i) the influence of aging on the sarcolemmal environment in the predominately fast-twitch plantaris muscle, and (ii) how lifelong mild (8%) CR and WR would affect the age-related affects. We hypothesized that aging would lead to a membrane environment that is indicative of reduced integrity and an exaggerated repair response that would be accompanied by increased Nox2 abundance."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionDisuse and mechanical unloading that occur during spaceflight can result in detrimental skeletal muscle atrophy and defects in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and function. Specifically, spaceflight and microgravity result in decreased muscle fiber size and altered activity of several metabolic enzymes in the soleus and tibialis muscles [1]. Within fast-twitch fibers, space flight decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity in the subsarcolemmal region, while slow-twitch fibers experienced altered distribution of succinate dehydrogenase activity across the entire fiber [2]. Additionally, simulated microgravity increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple cell types [3,4] and elevated pro-inflammatory signaling [5,6]. Sources of ROS that have been demonstrated to contribute to unloading-induced muscle atrophy include the mitochondria [7] and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) [8,9]. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to skeletal muscle wasting with denervation [10,11], unloading [7], and cachexia [12,13,14].Thus, there is a glaring need for preventative measures to maintain skeletal muscle health in astronauts enduring microgravity during their journeys to space. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that respond to alterations in mechanical loading [15]. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insufficient levels of stress proteins are proposed cellular mechanisms by which unloading causes pathology and impairment in musculoskeletal function. Mitochondrial ROS also appears to contribute to unloading-induced atrophy [7]. Mitochondria have many essential cellular roles, including mitochondria’s well known, essential function in energy production. Oxidative energy production in mitochondria is accomplished through enzymatic pathways in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), as well as substrate flux through the ETC, are important markers of metabolism adversely affected by unloading and spaceflight [16,17]. In addition, ROS production by electron leakage from the ETC can contribute to elevated oxidative stress during unloading [7,18]. Thus, there is current thought that preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of ROS leakage could mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight and disuse [14,19].Recent evidence has suggested that a pathway involving AMP kinase (AMPK) and siruitin-1 (SIRT1) can be instrumental not only in mitochondrial biogenesis [20,21], but also in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass [22]. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+dependent deacetylase that influences the activity of several enzymes and transcriptional regulators [23,24,25,26]. SIRT1 mediates responses to inflammatory, metabolic, and oxidative stressors. Specifically, SIRT1 moderates mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) [27,28,29]. Previous studies have identified several beneficial effects of SIRT1 activation on musculoskeletal and systemic health via pharmacological treatments, including improved endurance [30,31]. SIRT1 is also involved in skeletal muscle repair [22] and resveratrol’s anti-atrophic effects in aging skeletal muscle occur via SIRT1 [32]. Loss of SIRT1 appears to play a role in food depravation-induced muscle atrophy [33]. However, the potential mitigating role of SIRT1 in unloading-induced mitochondrial function and muscle atrophy is poorly understood.SRT2104 is a small molecule SIRT1 agonist that induces SIRT1 and downstream signaling [34]. For example, SIRT1 attenuated age-induced loss of muscle mass in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles [31]. In addition, SRT2104 treatment reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and elevated PGC-1α during hindlimb unloading in old mice [31]. Together, these results suggest SRT2104 could improve mitochondrial function and protect against muscle wasting. However, the impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ROS production has not been determined with mechanical unloading. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SRT2104 would rescue mechanical unloading-induced impairments in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, modulate redox responses, and protect skeletal muscle (e.g., soleus, gastrocnemius) mass. Fischer-344 rats were divided into the following conditions: ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 10 days (HU), and hindlimb unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT)."

        "Title": "Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: Proof of concept.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSkeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.\nSubject terms:\nCell biology, Physiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight requires a better mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to Mars and the moon. Extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. The microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness1–4. Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue4–8. Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASA’s long-term mission objectives.Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading9,10. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments11–15. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers16,17. In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross-sectional area4,6. A common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein18–20. However, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity21, disuse22, cancer23, and aging24compromises physical function and systemic health.Rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceflight microgravity conditions25–27. These bioreactors produce a low-shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain aspects of weightlessness27. However, they are not suitable for inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle fibers experience during exercise in spaceflight. Although tumbler bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation, they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise.Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through muscle fibers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium)28. Skeletal muscles are organized as multinucleated myofibers, whose function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis. Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area29,30, and shifting the % of slow-twitch fibers31,32. Unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased protein anabolism8. In addition, there is an increase in connective tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well33. Thus, maintaining mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes) to simulate spaceflight or exercise during spaceflight should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels bioreactors.Ergo, to study the physiological responses of skeletal muscle fibers to tensile loading, myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin-coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses34. Based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial loading35. Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system fitted that includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myotubes36,37as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry into gravitational environments."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionA clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands. As a result, the U.S. Water Recovery System (WRS) was launched to the ISS in 2008 with the goal of generating potable water from urine distillate, humidity condensate, and Sabatier product water, as well as the occasional off-loading of ground-supplied water [1]. The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA).As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [2]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr6+is reduced to Cr3+and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA (Fig. 1). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics. The DA functions under a vacuum to reduce the heat required to reach boiling point. Following distillation, UPA flex line 115 (UPA115) carries water vapor to the purge pump, where condensation occurs prior to collection for further processing by the WPA [4] (Fig. 1). The urine brine is transferred from the DA by UPA flex line 95 (UPA95) into the recycling tank (Fig. 1). The recycling tank accumulates brine, and current technology demonstrations onboard the ISS are achieving further water recovery by processing the brine [5]. Based on the current system, a maximum of 87% of the water from urine is removed and processed for downstream potable needs.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabUrine Processor Assembly schematic detailing the positions of the two flex line hoses (UPA95 and UPA115) (Fig. S3). Modified from Carteret al, 2011 [3].Upon departing the UPA, the condensed water enters the WPA wastewater tank, which does not have a validated means of microbial control. As such, approximately a year after being put into operation, the flow of water from this tank decreased due to an obstructing biofilm [1]. Biofouling within the ISS water system presents a significant risk to both vehicle and crew health. Biofilms can block lines and restrict access to clean water. Should pathogens be present, the risk of crew infection dramatically increases. Additionally, the persistence of biofilms can result in corrosion, overall materials degradation, and a failed water system. For these reasons, as a remedy to the biofilm noted downstream of the wastewater tank, additional filtration was added. While this water is examined periodically, the microbial profiles are determined after return of samples to Earth. The time in-between sample collection and analysis, and the lack of preservation, results in a skewed representation of the microbial population. The wastewater tank likely contains a thriving microbial community, but low diversity is noted upon ground evaluation, and no insight is gained toward the presence of possible biofilms. It is critical to enhance our understanding toward the microbial profiles, as well as associated biofilm potential, within the existing ISS WRS to the fullest extent to prepare for the next generation of spaceflight water systems.Catalytic oxidation, filtration, and the addition of a biocide during WPA processing serve to substantially reduce microbial contamination in the potable water. This water is held to stringent acceptability limits: 50 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total bacteria and no detectable coliforms per 100 mL [6]. The presence of coliforms is assessed monthly, while total bacteria are evaluated every quarter. There has never been a true positive coliform detected, and apart from the early checkout process, the levels of culturable bacteria are well below the requirement. However, following assessments of the wastewater tank, solenoid valve crevices, and filter mesh for the U.S. and Russian water systems, increased microbial levels have been noted [7].To survey the unique microbial community that is present in the water from the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD), the crew filters and cultures the bacteria onboard the ISS, then returns them to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Microbiology Laboratory for identification via partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing [6]. These techniques can determine both the overall bacterial levels (through in-flight colony counting) and the identification of culturable taxa. Typically, the level of bacteria is in the range of a few CFUs per ml. The bacterial genera routinely include common water contaminants such asBurkholderia,Ralstonia,Curvibacter,Cupriavidus,Sphingobium, and, frequently, other Gram-negative organisms that cannot be identified through the laboratory’s standard methods. As mentioned, the present method has important limitations, including the length of time between sample collection on orbit and subsequent analysis and possible degradation during transport from the ISS to the laboratory. Therefore, understanding of the actual microbial profiles within these systems would be enhanced by near real-time monitoring capabilities. Previous work has already demonstrated that sequencing in space is possible and can be performed with identical outcomes to those on the ground [[8],[9],[10]]. This shift in paradigm from Earth-based to spaceflight-based analysis has implications for a broad range of other molecular applications onboard the ISS, including water monitoring.Future NASA Programs such as Gateway, a lunar outpost allowing greater access to the lunar surface and a staging point for Mars missions, is expected to have a water recovery and recycling system. However, current planning anticipates Gateway will be unoccupied for up to 11 months per year, resulting in a dormant wetted, water system. A means of microbial control is paramount to this future system. NASA has initiated a robust anti-biofouling program in which many teams are investigating a diverse means of biofilm prevention and mitigation, but the organisms to use in these varied investigations are extremely limited. This coupled with a lack of insight beyond returned PWD and WPA wastewater tank samples, drove pursuing of the opportunity to microbially characterize UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines during refurbishment. The work described here aims to characterize the microorganisms found in the returned UPA flex lines and potentially identify the hosing positions as novel areas of interest for biofilm growth studies in the system. The current WRS employs numerous hosing connections with materials and sizes defined by the initial architecture plan. Determining potential microbial impacts regarding the WRS hosing will enable further engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention."

Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of\nEscherichia coli\nand\nSalmonella enterica,\nwe found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, clinostat, rotating wall vessel, microbial community, population dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, CFD-DEM",
        "Introduction": "1. Introduction1.1. Microbial Communities in SpaceMicrobial communities are an integral part of space exploration: they accompany human crew in habitats such as the International Space Station [1] and they will ultimately be used for bioregenerative life support [2], food and pharmaceuticals production [3], and in situ resource utilization [4]. Like all organisms, microbes experience stress in the space environment: studies have documented changes in virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and population diversity [5,6]. However, the mechanisms by which spaceflight induces these responses remain poorly understood. Many of the processes documented for multicellular organisms, such as mitochondrial dysregulation and mechanical unloading [7], do not apply to single-celled organisms; moreover, microorganisms almost invariably live in communities, but few studies of any organisms at any scale have investigated the effects of space conditions on interspecies interactions. Understanding the microbial space response requires an approach that considers the interactions between microbial cells and their environments at relevant spatial scales.1.2. Validating Clinostats for Accurate Artificial Microgravity ConditionsOf the stressors present in the spaceflight environment, altered gravity is the feature most likely to affect microorganisms in habitable environments, such as a spacecraft. It is also the feature most difficult to replicate in ground studies. Since spaceflight experiments are costly, logistically difficult, and inaccessible to many researchers, artificial microgravity devices, such as clinostats and rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, are commonly used to replicate microgravity conditions. An RWV is a type of clinostat that is used for cell culture: they are cylindrical culture vessels filled with liquid culture medium that constantly rotate the fluid environment, keeping cells in suspension by continuously changing the orientation of the gravity vector [8,9]. However, there is a fundamental difference between microbial cells and larger organisms in the way that rotation is used to simulate microgravity. For plants grown in clinostats, the constant rotation of the gravity vector results in an average gravity vector of zero over time. For microbial cells, which are believed to be unable to sense gravity directly, it is the ability of the RWV to mimic the unique fluid environment of microgravity that is likely its most important feature [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Understanding the fluid dynamics of the RWV is therefore critical for conducting rigorous research into the effects of spaceflight on microorganisms.1.3. The Microgravity Fluid EnvironmentThe loss of natural convection in microgravity causes the fluid environment to be quiescent. Likewise, the idealized RWV fluid environment is under solid-body rotation, with minimal fluid shear and turbulence [8]. However, a disparity is observed in the cellular response when comparing RWV and microgravity conditions, which may be caused by a complex set of factors, including hardware effects, mechanotransduction, and nutrient stress [16,17]. RWVs also exhibit centrifugal sedimentation of cell aggregates, resulting in localization that is different from that found in true microgravity [8]. There are very few commercially available bioreactors; therefore, they are often custom-designed by researchers and unique to each researcher’s experiment. A general lack of knowledge about accurate RWV conditions is a problem that may be one of the sources of contradictory conclusions about the effect of microgravity among cell biological circles, assuming there even is a unified microgravity response on bacterial cells at all [18,19].1.4. The Effect of Microgravity on Microbial EcologyThe interaction between the phases—that is, how microbial cells alter their fluid environment and vice versa—is especially important for understanding the behavior of multispecies microbial communities in space. No microbial species lives in isolation. Microorganisms form communities in which different species interact in numerous ways, and one of the interactions most commonly documented is the exchange of metabolites used for growth, often called cross-feeding [6,20]. In a quiescent microgravity fluid environment, reduced mixing could lead to a reduced exchange of metabolites, which, in turn, would shift community dynamics. Although a few microbial community experiments have been done in artificial microgravity [21], there are no previous studies that attempt to validate computational models for a quantitative understanding of microbial community dynamics in these devices. Numerous computational fluid dynamics studies on the macro-scale have been done to validate the ability of clinostats and RWV’s to produce the desired quiescent fluidic environment, but the scope of these studies often includes the fluid phase only, or solid parcel fractions, without metabolite scalar transport [22,23,24,25,26,27]. We sought to fill this gap by building a computational model that integrates both fluid and particle dynamics with biological metabolism and growth to generate predictions of microbial community dynamics in 1 g, microgravity, and RWV conditions. As an initial demonstration, we modeled a community composed of two obligately cross-feeding bacterial species that were previously studied and modeled extensively [20,28,29,30].1.5. Agent-Based Models for Microbial CommunitiesAgent-based models, also known as individual-based models, operate at the resolution of the individual cell. Each agent, i.e., bacterial cell, is given certain rules to follow, placed in an environment, and expected to interact with that environment as well as with other agents. Complex interactions between agents, distributions, and patterns arise from these models, and they are essential for the modeling of microbial communities. Computational agent-based models in the microbial ecology field are actively being developed; one of the latest scientific agent-based simulations is NUFEB [31], which features biological growth kinetics and coupled fluid–solid interaction, but not solute scalar transport.To apply the principles of agent-based modeling to spaceflight and artificial microgravity, we present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), which is an additional package for established, non-biological CFD-DEM software. It is based on the open-source software CFDEM®Coupling [32] and LIGGGHTS®[33], and it brings CFD-DEM modeling capability to RWVs. CAMDLES features include a rotating reference frame simulation environment, the buoyant Boussinesq approximation for natural convective flows, and Monod kinetic metabolic models for calculation of biological growth rates. CAMDLES is also the first agent-based model that directly couples metabolism to mass transfer."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both\nArabidopsis\n(cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO\n2\nconcentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO\n2\ndrawdown experiments).\nArabidopsis\nand wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature\nArabidopsis\nplants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO\n2\ndrawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO\n2\nincrease for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.\nKeywords:\nApogee Wheat,\nArabidopsis\n, canopy photosynthesis, controlled environment agriculture, elevated CO\n2\n, ISS spaceflight environment, NASA APH, microgravity",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) facility was designed and built by NASA and Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC, now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to conduct both fundamental and applied plant research in reduced gravity (Figure 1). Located in the Kibo module on the ISS, the APH was designed for a 10-year mission for collecting physiological data of plant responses to the spaceflight environment. This data will improve our understanding of how terrestrial biology responds to reduced gravity which is useful for enabling the manned exploration of space (National Research Council, 2011;Wheeler, 2017).FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabAPH Facility:(A)Modular APH subsystems.(B)Overall APH system architecture. Abbreviations are listed inTable 1.This paper describes the results of a hardware validation technology demonstration of the APH facility after its assembly on ISS. Technology demonstrations are simpler than typical flight experiments conducting peer-reviewed science designed to discern differences in plant responses caused by the lack of gravity (Stutte et al., 2015). As such, extensive science and experiment verification tests prior to flight, and a corresponding ground experiment mimicking the culture and environmental conditions experienced on ISS were not conducted.The goal of this hardware validation test was to demonstrate that the APH facility was fully operational and capable of conducting fundamental plant research in microgravity onboard the ISS. The functionality of APH subsystems was verified, as well as the ability of APH to grow two plant species in microgravity during a 7-week period. Minimal ground testing was conducted in an APH engineering development unit (i.e., a similar but non-flight qualified version of the APH) to ensure wheat andArabidopsisplants would germinate using the watering protocols recommended by the APH design team. The operation of the APH facility was verified by executing experiment profiles that controlled: (1) the environmental conditions during growth of each plant species, (2) chamber CO2to obtain daily gas exchange data from a plant canopy, and (3) chamber CO2and light intensity to conduct pre-programmed CO2drawdown experiments.Spaceflight Plant ResearchThe primary goal of several decades of spaceflight plant research has been to determine if plant growth, development, and reproduction in microgravity is similar to that on Earth (Stutte et al., 2015;Zabel et al., 2016). The goal of this research was to determine if future plant-based Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) growing crops for human colonies on the Moon or Mars (Averner et al., 1984;Wheeler, 2010,2017) can be sized using 1 g data (Monje et al., 2005). In addition, NASA has recently identified the need for new technologies in space crop production and food safety for supplementing the space diet with fresh leafy green crops in near term ISS, cislunar, and lunar missions (Massa et al., 2015;Anderson et al., 2017).Spaceflight plant research is conducted in plant chambers designed to operate in reduced gravity. Previous spaceflight experiments found that indirect effects of microgravity reduce plant growth in space (Musgrave et al., 1997;Monje et al., 2003). These indirect effects include: (1) altered behavior of liquids and gases affecting fluid behavior phenomena, (2) capillary-driven moisture redistribution resulting in poor root-zone aeration, and (3) the absence of buoyancy-driven convection causing poor mass and heat transfer to leaves and plant organs (Musgrave et al., 1997;Musgrave, 2002;Monje et al., 2003;Heinse et al., 2007;Kitaya et al., 2010;Stutte et al., 2015). Other considerations include the limited availability of resources in spacecraft (i.e., mass, power and volume) for plant chambers (Zabel et al., 2016). As a result, plant growth systems for conducting spaceflight experiments [e.g., Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC) and the Biomass Production System (BPS)] were designed to mitigate these secondary effects of the spaceflight environment using forced convection and actively watered root modules that provide well-aerated root zones (Stutte et al., 2015;Zabel et al., 2016). However, these systems were limited by small growth areas available for crop production. Larger plant growth systems are required to overcome the remaining challenges in spaceflight plant research. These challenges are to develop and demonstrate the performance of substrate-free, gravity-independent, water delivery systems to safely grow salad crops in reduced gravity environments for supplementing crew diets (Massa et al., 2015;Anderson et al., 2017;Monje et al., 2019;Khodadad et al., 2020).NASA Facilities Enable Future ExplorationNASA recently developed two new plant research facilities, Veggie and the APH, for conducting spaceflight plant research on ISS as recommended by the NRC Decadal Survey Study “Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era” (National Research Council, 2011). These facilities have larger plant growth areas (∼0.2 m2) and volumes than previous platforms, and are designed for studying crop production, plant-to-plant interactions, and human-plant-microbial ecosystems using large plants in space (Massa et al., 2016;Khodadad et al., 2020). Veggie uses LED lights, a passive watering system and minimal environmental control consisting of a fan to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. Recently, the Veggie was used to grow nutritious lettuce crops that are safe to eat on ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). In contrast, the APH facility is a research, plant growth chamber that can grow plants under complete environmental control (i.e., spectral quality, light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, CO2and ethylene concentration) for life cycles as long as 135 days (Morrow et al., 2016). It incorporates a root module watering design that is similar to those developed for ADVASC and BPS: a substrate-based water delivery system that actively controls matric potential of the root zone (Morrow and Crabb, 2000;Link et al., 2003;Morrow et al., 2004).The APH has the ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) for measuring plant growth during spaceflight, and significantly expands the lighting capabilities (e.g., higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations) available for plant research on ISS. The APH measures CO2and water vapor fluxes using non-destructive gas exchange techniques demonstrated on the BPS, a predecessor to the APH with an identical CO2control architecture (Monje et al., 2005). During the ISS Expedition 4 in 2002, the BPS was used to measure the photosynthetic canopy quantum yield (CQY), the conversion of absorbed radiation into gross CO2fixation, of wheat plant stands in microgravity using the CO2drawdown technique (Morrow et al., 2004,2016;Monje et al., 2005;Stutte et al., 2005). In that study, the canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY of 21-day-old wheat in microgravity did not differ from 1g controls at moderate light intensities (Stutte et al., 2005). The APH was designed to also measure canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY during spaceflight, however, at higher light intensities than previously available in the BPS. The APH provides lighting with a wide range in spectral quality and a maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1,000 μmol m–2s–1, which is nearly three times higher than was possible in the BPS.Future plant research conducted in Veggie and APH will enable exploration by improving our understanding of how plants, and their associated microbiomes in leaves and roots, grow in the spaceflight environment. This knowledge is useful for developing suitable countermeasures to mitigate potential problems of crop production, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization needed for supporting sustainable and long-term human colonies in space (Wheeler, 2010,2017).APH FacilityThe APH facility is a platform that permits the collection of physiological and environmental data to test specific hypotheses on how plant development, gene expression, photosynthesis and respiration, seed formation, plant/microbe interactions, or growth rate may respond to primary effects of microgravity or to secondary effects of the spaceflight environment. The APH is a controlled environment chamber (0.2 m2by 0.4 m tall) that is teleoperated from the ground, permitting minimal crew involvement to conduct science (Figure 1A). Crew operations are limited to adding water to the APH reservoirs, collecting biological samples, harvesting plants, and conducting periodic system maintenance. Biological samples from shoots and roots grown in APH (such as leaf disks, periodic harvest of plants, etc.) can be returned frozen, or in Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) containing fixatives (e.g., RNAlater), for post-flight analysis on the ground.The growth chamber controls temperature (T; 18–30°C), relative humidity (RH; 50–90%), CO2concentration (400–5,000 μmol mol–1), wind speed (0.3–1.5 m s–1), spectral quality, and provides the highest light level (up to 1,000 μmol m–2s–1) of any spaceflight chamber to date (Massa et al., 2016;Zabel et al., 2016). In its baseline configuration, the plants germinate and grow in the APH Science Carrier (SC), a four-quadrant rooting module, using fertilized substrate-based media. Water for filling the reservoirs and wetting the rooting media are initially supplied from ISS potable water, while the majority of the water for sustaining plant growth and operations is provided by condensed humidity that is recycled back to the reservoir. Soil (media) water content is controlled in each rooting quadrant using an active moisture control system.Currently, the baseline configuration of the SC is a single-use 0.2 m2module that uses a porous granular substrate (1–2 mm arcillite) as rooting media. The media is watered using a manifold of porous ceramic tubes, and moisture content is actively controlled with negative pressure (i.e., suction) to provide optimum root zone water and O2in microgravity (Monje et al., 2005;Stutte et al., 2005;Morrow et al., 2016). The amount of consumable media (∼4 kg per experiment) required by the current APH SC configuration makes this growth system unsustainable for future food production missions beyond low Earth orbit (Monje et al., 2019), but it is adequate for conducting space biology and life-cycle crop production experiments. In space biology experiments, used root modules are often discarded after the plants are harvested because sample return space and down mass from the ISS is limited, however, the APH facility is versatile and can accommodate alternative SC designs for testing future sustainable crop production systems.APH ArchitectureThe APH facility (Figure 1A) consists of the PHARMER (Plant Habitat Avionics Realtime Manager in EXPRESS Rack seeTable 1for abbreviations) that commands several APH subsystems, including the Growth Chamber (GC) and the Growth Light Assembly (GLA). The GC controls ambient CO2concentration, removes ethylene, and houses the SC root module (Figures 2A–C). The PHARMER subsystem interfaces with other APH subsystems to monitor and control the internal APH environment and fluid levels along with APH thermal and power paths.TABLE 1.List of abbreviations.SymbolDefinitionAAAAvionics air assemblyADVSCAdvance AstrocultureAPHAdvance Plant HabitatBLSSBioregenerative life support systemsBPSBiomass Production SystemCQYCanopy quantum yieldCWFCool white fluorescentDAPDays after plantingDPMData processing moduleEMAExperiment Monitoring AreaECSEnvironmental control subsystemsFDSFire detection systemGCGrowth chamberGLAGrowth light assemblyGUIGraphical user interfaceHPSHigh pressure sodiumISSInternational Space StationKFTKennedy fixation tubesKSCKennedy Space CenterMTLModerate temperature loopNIRNear-infraredORUOrbital replacement unitPH-01Plant Habitat 1 experimentPHARMERPlant habitat avionics realtime manager in EXPRESS rackPDAPower distribution assemblyPnetCanopy net photosynthetic ratePPFDPhotosynthetic photon flux densityRdarkCanopy dark respiration rateSCScience carrierTCSThermal control subsystemTReKTelescience resource kit softwareVESVacuum exhaust systemWGSWaste gas systemWRADSWater recovery and distribution subsystemOpen in a new tabFIGURE 2.Open in a new tabAPH Growth chamber subsystems: Science Carrier [SC;(A–E)] and Growth Light Assembly [GLA;(F–I)]. The SC is packed with 1–2 mm arcillite(A–C). The planting, germination and cultivation procedures were demonstrated in APH during ground studies(D). The Flight SC was shipped wrapped in a Tedlar bag(E). The GLA illuminates plants with LED lighting of different wavelengths: blue 455 nm(F), green 530 nm(G), red 630 nm(H), far-red 735 nm, and white 4100 K. The GLA can also provide mixed light recipes: red, blue, and white(I).The APH has two Environmental Control Subsystems (ECS) that physically interface to the EXPRESS Rack Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) system, Avionics Air Assembly (AAA), and Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) (Figure 1B). The ECS units control GC air circulation, filtration, and provide temperature and humidity conditioning. The Water Recovery and Distribution Subsystem (WRADS) operates in conjunction with the APH ECS to provide water to the plant growth chamber. The APH facility has two water reservoirs (Distribution and Recovery) with a combined volume of 3 L. Plants growing in the GC transpire water supplied to the root zone from the 2 L Distribution reservoir. Transpired water is condensed and stored in the 1 L Recovery reservoir. The ECS replenishes the Recovery reservoir with condensate water and the WRADS dispenses water stored in the Distribution reservoir to each quadrant of the SC. The APH Power Distribution Assembly (PDA) is powered via the EXPRESS Rack power interface and provides the appropriate power levels to APH components: PHARMER, GC, GLA, SC, ECS, WRADS, and the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS).The PHARMER also provides the communication path for command uplink to APH and telemetry downlink from APH via the EXPRESS Rack. Commanding of APH from the ground (i.e., teleoperation) was conducted at the Experiment Monitoring Area (EMA) at KSC."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nControl over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions\nin vivo\nin vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin\ndirigere\n, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological rolesin plantaare considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies (1).The entry point into presumed phenoxy radical-radical coupling to the 8–8′ lignan class involves one electron oxidation of the monolignol,e.g.coniferyl alcohol (Fig. 1A,1), which in the presence of a specific type of dirigent protein (DP; from the Latindirigere, to guide or to align)2(3), can undergo distinct forms of stereoselective coupling to afford either the (+)- or the (−)-antipode of pinoresinol (Fig. 1A,2aor2b) (1,3–6). Mechanistically, one electron oxidation (e.g.catalyzed by laccases, peroxidases) is envisaged to generate the corresponding coniferyl alcohol (1)-derived free radical intermediate (CA•), which then binds to the DPs. Bound substrate orientation subsequently occurs in such a way as to enable 8–8′ coupling at thesi-siface with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford (+)-pinoresinol (Fig. 1A,2a), such as inForsythia intermedia(3),Thuja plicata(4),Schizandra chinensis(5), or pea (Pisum sativum) (7), or alternativelyre-recoupling to give the (−)-antipode (Fig. 1A,2b) as inArabidopsis(1,5,6) and flax (Linum usitatissimum).3Of these, the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP in pea is annotated as PsDRR206 (9), and the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP inArabidopsis thalianais named AtDIR6 (5).FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabPinoresinol-forming dirigent proteins.A, proposed biosynthesis mechanism to afford (+)- or (−)-pinoresinols (2aor2b) in DP-guided stereoselective couplings with coniferyl alcohol (1) as substrate.B, amino acid sequence alignments of mature (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs with their structural homologue AtAOC2.

These results are discussed with regard to previously proposed mechanisms for DP-mediated CA•coupling (10) and a published homology model of AtDIR6 (11), as well as existing x-ray structures of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) (12,13). AOC is a plant enzyme that forms 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, an intermediate in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, from a reactive allene oxide precursor, 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate (14). AOC shares distant sequence similarity to DPs."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nArogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis\nADT\nmutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in\nADT\nmutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in\nADT\nmutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and\nadt3/4/5/6\n, our most extreme\nADT\nknockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMultiple\nArabidopsis\narogenate dehydratase (\nADT\n) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to\ncirca\n70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple\nADT\nKO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models\nin situ\n, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in\nADT\nKO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.\nKeywords:\nlignin, arogenate dehydratases, multi-omics, network analysis,\nArabidopsis\n, ribocode",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionArogenate is an important branch-point to either tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe) in vascular plants, whose formation from arogenate (Agn) is catalyzed by arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), respectively (Figure 1). The Phe so formed can then be incorporated into either proteins or massively utilized in the phenylpropanoid pathway to produce lignins, as well as other related metabolites (e.g., lignans, allyl/propenyl phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthocyanins) depending upon the species. In our earlier studies, homozygous single and multipleArabidopsis ADTknock-out (KO) lines with homologous T-DNA insertion mutations were obtained, with the most extreme phenotypes showing an ∼70% reduction in lignin content as compared to wild type (WT) plants (Corea et al., 2012a,b,c). Phenotypes of the former also displayed prostrate stems and lowest stem dry weights/heights.FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabSimplified metabolic pathways linking photosynthesis, carbon fixation and lignin biosynthesis, as well as placement of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) between the chorismate-shikimate, aromatic amino acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways in vascular plant systems. Selected metabolites are illustrated along with enzymes depicted by arrows.Differentially varying lignin levels as above, obtained through systematic manipulation of the 6-memberedArabidopsis ADTgene family (ADT1, At1g11790;ADT2, At3g07630;ADT3, At2g27820;ADT4, At3g44720;ADT5, At5g22630, andADT6, At1g08250), thus offered the opportunity to investigate the holistic nature of such perturbations on overallArabidopsissystems biology. To do this, we carried out multi-omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analyses of leaf and stem tissues of single (adt1,adt3,adt4,adt5, andadt6), double, triple and quadruple (adt4/5,adt1/4/5,adt3/4/5, andadt3/4/5/6) KO mutant and WT lines, at 4 weeks of growth/development.In this study, multi-omics “normalization” strategies were employed to enable direct integration and visualization of the disparate “omics” datasets of related transcripts, proteins and metabolites, thereby allowing for greater understanding, confidence and validation of resulting systemic biological perturbations observed. Network analysis (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) was also used to (a) identify enzymes or processes most highly correlated to different lignin levels, and (b) reveal potentially novel enzymes or processes related with lignin level regulation and biosynthesis. This analysis resulted in our provisionally deducing novel transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulatory processes, when carbon flux was reduced in the phenylpropanoid pathway and which profoundly affected lignin deposition.Many proteins identified in our network analysis have not been reported as potentially linked to lignin biosynthesis regulation. For example, several ribosome subunits with high correlations to lignin level profiles were identified, suggesting the possible presence of a “ribocode.” These proteins, as well as other ribosome-interacting mRNA processing proteins detected in our network analysis, indicate that vascular plant lignin levels are not only controlled at the point of transcription but work together with modulating factors at a post-transcriptional and translational level as described below."

        "Title": "Functional consequences of radiation-induced oxidative stress in cultured neural stem cells and the brain exposed to charged particle irradiation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAims:\nRedox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment.\nResults:\nLow doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionTravel to spacenecessitates exposure to radiation fields containing a spectrum of charged particles having different fluences and energies (15). These fully ionized particles range from protons to iron ions and are derived from solar emissions including periodic flares (mainly protons) along with the galactic cosmic rays (High Z and Energy [HZE] particles). Exposure to such radiation poses a risk that will be proportional to the frequency of particle traversals and the radiation quality (i.e.,linear energy transfer [LET]) of that particle (6,20), although for many central nervous system (CNS) endpoints this relationship is overly simplistic. While energetic protons have relatively low LET, HZE particles typically found in space have much larger LET values that depend on the mass and energy of the ion. These highly energetic (MeV-GeV/n) particles can cause significant cellular damage by direct traversal through tissues of the body andviasecondary ionizations caused by delta rays emanating from the track core (14,41).The high and low LET characteristics of HZE particles imply that heavy ions can elicit not only extensive damage in cells directly incurring traversals (i.e.,along the particle trajectory), but also wide-ranging damage to cells more distal to the track of the particle (14,41). In either case, exposure of neural stem cells and their differentiated progeny to these radiation types can elicit oxidative stress with a range of potentially adverse consequences. Past work characterizing the radioresponse of neural stem and precursor cells exposed to HZE particles has shown that changes in oxidative stress and cell killing are generally enhanced and more prolonged when compared with lower LET radiation modalities (25,32,33). We have documented the capability of ionizing radiation to elicit increased oxidative stress in several types of neural stem and precursor cells (1,29,32,33). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) detected after exposure to different radiation modalities have in general, been shown to be both dose-dependent and temporally persistent, albeit after relatively higher (≥1 Gy) doses (25,32).Innovation.Studies were conducted to determine whether space-relevant fluences of High Z and Energy (HZE) particles could elicit long-lasting changes in the redox state of neural stem and precursor cells that are critical for maintaining cognitive health. Data suggest that relatively infrequent HZE events may elicit chronic changes in the physiology of such cells. To the extent that altered redox state elicits functional changes in the central nervous system, then our findings suggest that astronauts may have a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing longer-term cognitive sequelae upon return to the terrestrial environment.Past reports have typically used such higher doses, but do not represent realistic exposures that might be encountered during a short mission to the moon, or an even longer mission in space outside the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere (16,32).The paucity of heavy ion data collected after more realistic exposure scenarios (≤1 Gy) prompted the current studies, aimed at determining the short- and long-term consequences of exposing neural stem and precursor cells to very low doses and particle fluences of56Fe ions. Here, we report that neural stem and precursor cells exposed to very low doses and fluences of charged particles exhibit significant and prolonged increases in oxidative stress, changes that are temporally coincident with altered cognition."

While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion\nin vivo\n. However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the “last mile” a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.\nKeywords:\ndiabetes type 1, beta cell replacement therapy, islet, scalability, stem cell derived beta cells",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionGravity plays a key role in plant growth [1].Arabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) is a flowering plant that has been chosen by biologists as a model plant organism to study the effects of gravity and other environmental stressors, since it has a short life cycle and because of the existence of a multitude of mutants and transgenic plants. The current visibility ofArabidopsisresearch reflects the growing realization among biologists that this simple angiosperm can serve as a convenient model not only for plant biology but also for addressing fundamental questions of biological structure and function common to all Eukaryotes [2]. To achieve the goal of providing long term life support for deep space missions a fundamental knowledge on plant growth in spaceflight has to be gained. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently equipped with all capabilities to collect data needed to address fundamental questions of plant physiology and development in spaceflight microgravity [3].In this article, we are interested in identifying the genes that show transcriptional abundance under the influence of spaceflight microgravity, and the genes primarily influencing root growth and cell wall biosynthesis in spaceflight. The transcriptomic profile ofArabidopsishas been studied in simulated microgravity [4]. The effect of gravity and mechanical stimulation on the growth of the root apex ofArabidopsishas resulted in transient changes in gene expressions [5]. The effect of spaceflight microgravity onArabidopsisroot growth is presented in [6]. Cell wall modeling in the roots, shoots, and hypocotyls of plants is an important metabolic adaptation brought about by genes and proteins. Metabolic phenotyping ofArabidopsishas been carried out on the ground [7]. Metabolic fingerprinting is important for improving the quality of crops grown in spaceflight. Several of the cell wall proteome changes have been corroborated with transcriptomic changes in spaceflight [8]. As plants are important for the bioregenerative life support in spaceflight, the cell wall perturbations may affect the yield of crops grown in the altered spaceflight environment [9]. Of the 33 XTH Arabidopsis root growth genes, XTH17 to XTH20 are the main contributors [10]. Nucleotide sugar interconversions in plants are discussed in [11,12]. From terrestrial studies, nucleotide-diphsopho-(NPD) sugar interconversion enzymes (NSE) of the small dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily are given in [13]. Plant Cell Wall (PCW) genes were identified using gene co-expression analysis in [14], and it was shown how these genes are transcriptionally co-regulated [15]. These sugars require subtle quantitative control during plant root growth and development. Hence, it is important to identify the genes that encode these enzymes involved in regulating growth of adventitious roots, and their waving and skewing in spaceflight microgravity.Researchers have used various ecotypes and mutants ofArabidopsisto isolate genes with transcriptional variation in spaceflight environment compared to on the ground. Since we are not doing the experiment and performing the data collection, we rely on datasets available from GeneLab for plants grown in spaceflight microgravity. GeneLab provides transcriptomic datasets for various ecotypes ofArabidopsisfrom spaceflight. TheArabidopsisecotypes Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0 showed differential gene expression due to oxidative stress in spaceflight [16]. Differential gene expression analysis ofArabidopsisexposed over six days to blue light at different levels of gravity in comparison to unit gravity control has been presented in [17], and it was found that blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce stress due to lower levels of gravity in spaceflight. It was found that plants in spaceflight microgravity grow slower than plants in unit gravity on the ground. Two ecotypes ofArabidopsis(WS and Col-0) were grown in spaceflight under directional light, and it was found that skewing and waving of roots were independent of gravity, the roots were negatively phototropic, and both ecotypes skewed differently in the presence of light, due to a lack of gravity [18]. Major organ-specific and cellular remodeling ofArabidopsishas been identified from its growth in ISS and physiological adaptation to spaceflight [3,19]. Previous literature, cited above, characterized unique transcriptions in WS, Col-0, and PhyD mutant ofArabidopsisusing heat maps and fold change analysis methods. For all the genome analysis done, no phenotypic measurements have been presented or discussed. However, the gradient-light experiments conducted in the ISS resulted in the plant root growth in a skewing pattern. These were dramatic observations of phenotype changes concerning root growth and cell wall response in microgravity. Hence, we have chosen the GLDS-7 [3] and GLDS-120 [20] datasets collected under different lighting settings for applying our network analysis methods.The biochemical interactions within a cell of a biological system are formulated as gene regulatory networks for modeling biological processes. GRNs are used to represent regulatory and transcriptional functions that underlie cellular, molecular, and biological phenomena. GRNs have become an indispensable tool that facilitates interpretation of biological processes, molecular functions, protein interactions, genome to phenome analysis, cellular differentiation, identification of genes as biomarkers, and the response of an organism to external stimuli. A Bayesian network generation method for GRN constructed forArabidopsishas been presented [21]. Several machine learning algorithms have been implemented for the generation of these networks [22]. In [23], several statistical and machine learning methods have been reviewed for the prediction of GRNs from transcriptome datasets. In [24], many algorithms for GRN inferencing from single-cell transcriptomic data are benchmarked using simulated data. Several GRNs have been generated to study root development inArabidopsis[25]. Vascular root development has been represented using GRNs in [26]. Furthermore,Arabidopsissecondary cell wall synthesis has been studied using a protein-DNA regulatory network and genes involved in secondary cell wall modeling, which form the cell shape and the bulk of the plant biomass [27]. Other GRNs forArabidopsisgrowth and development are presented in [28]. Gene Ontology is the process of classifying an annotated gene to a particular function. Gene set enrichment analysis is used to determine changes of expression in groups of a priori defined gene sets. Additional web-tools and databases are available forArabidopsisgene expression analysis [29]. These GRN studies do not identify hub genes and the target (authority) genes they regulate in spaceflight microgravity compared to on the ground for important biological processes that are affected in spaceflight, nor perform rigorous graph theoretic network analysis and derive biological interpretations.We have used three basic graph-based network approaches in this paper (1) the LASSO, (2) Pearson correlation, and (3) HITS methods. LASSO and Pearson correlation methods are applied to construct GRNs of transcriptional regulations in spaceflight microgravity as well as ground control.Section 2presents the materials and methods used for GRN inferencing and analysis. InSection 3, we present the results of the GRN analysis of the significant hub genes (identified from Pearson and HITS method) with the highest transcriptional abundance in spaceflight microgravity. Results from network analysis of theArabidopsisecotypes and genotype are discussed in this section. The root growth and cell wall genes affected in spaceflight microgravity are isolated and their molecular functions are discussed.Section 4presents the conclusions."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpace is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4].The plantArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets ofArabidopsis[7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR inArabidopsishas shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination [8]. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) areArabidopsishomologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes [9]. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes inArabidopsisdue to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in [10]. Two mutants ofArabidopsisdefective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation [11]. The effect of acute radiation onArabidopsisgrowth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in [12].Apart from DDR, plants adopt pigment biosynthesis processes to protect them against Ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These pigments are flavonoids, betalains, and carotenoids. Flavonoids provide a range of color from pale-yellow to blue and belong to the class of phenylpropanoids [13]. Carotenoids contain up to 15 conjugated double bonds [14]. It has been shown that light induces expression of carotenoid genes during leaf, flower development, and fruit ripening inArabidopsis[15]. Carotenoids protect the plant against excessive light and add color to the flowers, fruits, and seeds [16].163 ATR/ATM genes inArabidopsishave been shown experimentally as responding to ionizing radiation in [11]. We call these ATR/ATM genes radiation-induced genes and other downstream genes of stress signaling non-radiation-induced genes [17]. There is no putative radiation subnetwork analysis for detecting radiation and non-radiation induced genes that are involved in biological processes related to radiation response in the plant. In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation onArabidopsisfound in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR onArabidopsis: gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR [18]. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds. In this paper, we investigate CBP regulation in the spaceflight environment, as well.As modules are more informative for the regulatory mechanism of a biological process [19], we perform module-based analysis and have identified radiation and non-radiation induced gene/protein interactions in DNA repair processes, as well as flavonoids and carotenoids that respond to light environment in spaceflight. We call these modules subnetworks. Thehypothesisof this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.\nKeywords:\nlow Earth orbit, environmental enrichment, neuroblasts, doublecortin, activated caspase-3",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose\nSpace travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation.\nMethods\nCardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.\nResults\nThe combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.\nConclusions\nThis study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionExposure to high doses of ionizing radiation may cause cardiac toxicity that involves pericarditis, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1,2]. While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients [3–5], adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure [6–8]. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material [9]. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel.One mechanism by which ionizing radiation may lead to cardiac toxicity is through increased oxidative stress. One characteristic of ionizing radiation is the formation of free radicals, e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10,11]. An increase in oxidative stress has been observed in Russian cosmonauts and in space flown animal models [12–14]. Recently, Azimzadeh et al., demonstrated a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), indicative of an increase in oxidative stress in post-mortem left ventricular tissue from Mayak nuclear workers that had been exposed to low dose-rate γ-radiation [15]. Furthermore, Soucy et al. demonstrated increased activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that generates ROS, in the rat aorta following exposure to 5 Gy γ-radiation [16]. Additionally, mitochondria isolated from mice 4 weeks after 2 Gy local heart X-ray irradiation show an increase in ROS levels when presented with an additional insult [17].Oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is an important buffering mechanism to reduce ROS levels. Hence, the ratio of tissue levels of GSH to GSSG is used as one indicator of oxidative stress.Another mechanism by which radiation may affect the heart is through DNA methylation, an important mechanism of maintenance of cellular homeostasis [18,19]. Cardiovascular disease is associated with alterations of DNA methylation [20,21]. Moreover, radiation exposure has recently been shown to alter the DNA methylation patterns in the mouse heart [19]. Methionine and the methionine cycle are critical for the production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), a major methyl donor [22]. Impairments in the methionine cycle up to 48 hours following radiation have been observed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361 by O’Leary et al. through the suppression of methionine adenosyltranseferase by the long noncoding RNA, PARTICLE [23]. O’leary et al. observed a transient increase in PARTICLE 4 and 24 hours after 0.25 Gy γ-irradiation and a corresponding decrease in SAM 4 hours after radiation [23]. While methionine metabolism directly influences DNA methylation potential, it also plays an important role in redox status. Increases in oxidative stress result in homocysteine, a reversible product in the methionine cycle, to be diverted away from the methionine cycle; thus, 1) decreasing the ability of the cells or tissues to methylate DNA [24] and 2) supporting the synthesis of the antioxidant GSH through the irreversible transsulfuration of methionine [25]. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that exposure to low absorbed doses of space radiation resulted in long-term shifts in the heart tissue methionine concentrations, the ratio of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and DNA methylation [19].In addition to space radiation as an occupational hazard, microgravity also presents a unique challenge to an astronaut. Microgravity has been shown to play a role in epigenetics, or DNA methylation, in breast cancer cell lines, human lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cells. [26–29]. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress coupled with impairment of antioxidant mechanisms and inflammation have been shown in skeletal muscle following exposure to simulated microgravity [30]. Recently, Mao et al. showed that a combined exposure to hindlimb unloading (HU) and low-dose rate γ-radiation may increase oxidative damage and decrease antioxidant protein content in the mouse brain [31]. To be able to model simultaneous HU and exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation, Mao et al. placed cages of hind-limb unloaded mice onto Co-57 plates that emitted ionizing radiation in the form of γ-rays at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h.Since, the combined effects of low-dose rate radiation exposure and microgravity on the heart are largely unknown, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate indicators of oxidative stress and tissue remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from the mice in the study of Mao et al. [31]."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.\nSubject terms:\nProteomic analysis, Molecular neuroscience",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAstronaut health and safety are of key importance to the success of long-term missions in space. More than 50% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) have reported a subjective change in their visual acuity1. The underlying mechanisms and pathological manifestations of increased vision impairment during and after spaceflight is currently unknown. Various factors have been suggested to account for these disturbances, including increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the cerebrovascular barrier function would serve to elevate ICP2. Similar to how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions in the cranium, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an endothelial barrier which regulates vascular permeability and maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). Little work has been done to examine retinal structure and BRB integrity/function following prolonged exposure to spaceflight in animal models.Spaceflight has been reported to have numerous negative effects on ocular and structure and function3. However, data on how spaceflight impacts protein expression in the retina are limited. We have previously evaluated ocular tissue responses obtained from mice flown to and from the ISS on both the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135)4as well as the SpaceX-9 Dragon rocket5. Although numerous differences were noted in the flight mice compared to control animals on ground, an intriguing finding especially relevant to the present study was that spaceflight conditions induced significant changes in protein expression related to endothelial apoptosis, inflammation and metabolic function in the retina.The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and BRB integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a proteomics approach."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.\nKeywords:\nhindlimb unloading, chronic low-dose irradiation, brain, transcriptome",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation [1] and fluid shifts [2] experienced during short- and long-term spaceflight. An important goal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to identify the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on the CNS to better prepare astronauts during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. During missions beyond low-earth orbit (LEO), astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). While high linear energy transfer (LET) galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and low LET solar particle event (SPE) radiation contribute large portions of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3], interactions between GCR and SPE particles and spacecraft release secondary radiation including γ-rays that can deliver a significant fraction of the total mission does [4]. In addition, altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight) affects homeostatic fluid-shifting in the CNS. Studies examining readaptation to Earth’s gravity are of equal importance, as recovery from spaceflight exposure may require medical intervention, in particular within organs known to be sensitive to irradiation and fluid shifts.Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleep–wake cycles) [5]. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) [6]. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre- and post-flight (shuttle missions <30 days and ISS mission <200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans [7].Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight [8]. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior [9,10,11].The effects of acute radiation doses on the CNS have been well documented [12]. However, responses to chronic LDR exposure, as encountered on space missions (<0.04 Gy/y), are not well investigated [13], particularly in a pan-transcriptome context. Moreover, long-term readaptive outcomes on neurohealth following spaceflight-like conditions are less studied. Due to the need to better understand the transcriptional changes associated with chronic LDR in combination with reduced gravity (unloading) on neurohealth, mice were exposed to chronic LDR γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy), HLU, or a combination of HLU+LDR for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), while data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) were analyzed to determine differentially methylated promoters (DMP) [14]. Overall, we found minimal gene alterations at 4 months of readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR, namely, in pathways related to the reduced expression of translational machinery, while the combination of HLU+LDR resulted in a wide panel of altered DEG and DMP profiles for tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis markers and neuropeptides. Therefore, exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair that is cooperatively engaged post-HLU+LDR exposure to maintain neural homeostasis."

Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionWe are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality1. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized2,3.In humans, one of the most apparent physiological responses to the space environment is the redistribution of fluid throughout the body that occurs due to microgravity. This redistribution shifts fluid upward from the lower parts of the body4. An increased intracranial pressure caused by this fluid shift has been attributed as a major cause of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)5. 40% of astronauts have experienced SANS6, including the spaceflight subject of the NASA twins study7. The physiological impact of SANS encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening (GF), choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)5,8. While the physiological characteristics of SANS are well documented, the mechanisms that drive SANS are still poorly understood.To date, despite evidence showing ocular functioning impairment following exposure to the space environment, few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms involved in the spaceflight-associated changes in retinal structure and function. A previous study from our group characterized the effects of a 13-day exposure to the space environment aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) in mice. This study found that spaceflight conditions induced oxidative damage that resulted in mitochondrial apoptosis in the mouse retina2. Subsequent work with low-dose proton radiation and a simulated microgravity mice model showed a major role of simulated space radiation in the increase of oxidative stress, with synergistic effects when simulated microgravity was applied9,10. In our current study, mice were exposed to the space environment for 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed to spaceflight."

        "Title": "Evaluating ocular response in the retina and optic nerve head after single and fractionated high-energy protons",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThere are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (\np\n< 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.\nKeywords:\nspace radiation, protons, mouse retina, optic nerve head, blood-retinal barrier, fractionation dose, apoptosis, oxidative stress",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpace radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) will pose significant health risks, especially for long-duration lunar and Mars missions. GCR are continuous low-dose-rate exposures composed of approximately 87% protons, 12% helium ions, and 1% high charge, high energy (HZE) particles of Z > 2 and will comprise the majority of space radiation exposure for long- duration missions beyond the Van Allen belts [1]. The space radiation environment also consists of mixtures of high-energy protons and a minor fraction of other ions released from the sun during SPEs. During long-term deep space missions, it is anticipated that multiple SPEs will be encountered. We and others have been studying the effects of space radiation on the ocular tissue in animal models using beams of high-energy protons produced by particle accelerators [2,3,4,5].Prolonged spaceflight induces physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities in astronauts, collectively defined as the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) [6]. However, the underlying mechanisms of the changes and factors contributing to the development of damage are unclear. Studies have shown that radiation at doses less than 1 Gy induced significant levels of retinal oxidative damage including retinal cell apoptosis [4]. More recent reports showed optical nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optical nerve disc including prelaminar region, lamina cribrosa, and retro-laminar region [7]. The mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of optic disc edema are less known and not well investigated. Recognizing the importance of the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight, we believe that understanding the impact of space radiation on the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) is crucial in assessing the risk to astronauts during long-duration missions, especially for future deep-space missions that will expose astronauts to greater radiation than previously encountered [8]. However, the effects of spaceflight relevant dose and dose rate exposures to protons in the mouse retina and in the ONH have not been previously addressed.The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of whole-body proton exposure at a single dose of 0.5 Gy on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retinal and ONH region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated doses for a total dose of 0.5 Gy in 12 equal fractions over 25 days to simulate the chronic exposures in space."

Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoString\nTM\n) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (\np\n< 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.\nSubject terms:\nNeuroscience, Chronic inflammation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts1,2caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success3. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts3. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified4–8. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging9–12. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells13and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB)14. Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function15. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion16. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion17. Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis18.The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption19, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids20and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses21. Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage22–26. Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling27–30. However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact.The goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene expression using a neuroinflammatory assay panel to investigate inflammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue after spaceflight."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight hazards such as microgravity and space radiation are anticipated to impact biological systems and could potentially affect crew health and performance both in mission and once astronauts return to Earth. These unique hazards have been thought to induce adverse changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with a frequently reported impact on ocular function1–4. Resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the International Space Station (ISS) are limited and it is difficult to recreate spaceflight conditions on the ground for controlled experiments. Therefore, characterization of the type and magnitude of these changes is challenging. Despite these challenges, analogs can be used to inform the understanding of the spaceflight environment impacts on biology and support development of mitigation strategies to reduce spaceflight health risks. Ground-based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, advances in bioinformatics have expanded the potential scientific return of prior experiments provided data is accessible for re-evaluation. Fortunately, NASA’s GeneLab is an open-access omics database for space-relevant biological experiments that provides access to uniformly formatted data5.The current study leverages transcriptomic and methylation sequencing data acquired as part of a larger experiment to understand the longitudinal effects and underlying mechanisms of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure and hindlimb unloading (HLU; an analog for microgravity) on neurovascular oxidative stress and brain function6. Global transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq quantifies gene expression at the time of sample acquisition while reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyzes DNA methylation, which is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications involved in disease development7–9.Previous studies analyzed spaceflight-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic response in murine retina10,11or evaluated response to different ground-based hazard analogs in murine brain6and spleen12. The spaceflight studies reported expression and methylation changes in genes known to be involved in visual perception, phototransduction, and macular degeneration pathways in murine models. However, these studies were performed in space where effects of both space radiation and microgravity on the retina were intertwined. In addition, these studies were performed 35–37 days after a spaceflight and there was no analysis done on longitudinal changes in the retina due to radiation or microgravity.To our knowledge, the current analysis is the first multi-omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We report differentially expressed genes (DEG), differentially methylated genes (DMG), and biological processes (BP) that are exclusive to, or shared across, multiple exposure conditions and post-exposure time points. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the NASA Twins Study13and in the retina of mice flown to space11, with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure. This study provides an insight into the retinal response to exposures that are frequently used as analogs for individual spaceflight hazard and their interplay at different post-exposure stages, and contributes towards identifying key pathways to interrogate that may provide translational relevance across exposure types."

Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions.

There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionNeuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been identified in astronauts. These complex physiological and pathological changes are collectively defined as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. The condition can lead to long-term effects, including changes in visual acuity, even after the astronauts have returned to Earth. The underlying mechanisms of the changes and functional outcomes of observed ocular change remain poorly understood.An increase in oxidative stress in the retina and photoreceptors is thought to be a key factor in the development of retinal disease [2]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to damage of the critical cell populations and tissue remodeling. Previous studies have revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for the oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), in the retina, following space radiation exposure [3] and spaceflight [4].Because environmental, radiotherapy, and pathological conditions can induce the production of a high level of unstable oxygen species, efforts have been made to develop drugs with therapeutic potential. However, practical application has been somewhat disappointing due to complications such as short half-lives, low reaction rate constants, lack of cellular uptake, and hypersensitivity reactions [5]. Metal-containing catalytic antioxidants have emerged as especially promising. Of these, redox-active metalloporphyrins possess distinct antioxidant properties, including scavenging O2−, H2O2, and lipid peroxides that mediate cellular and tissue damage [6]. These compounds have proven efficacious in numerous in vivo animal models of disease in reducing oxidative stress [7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, in previous studies, we documented the protective effects of a redox-active metalloporphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) to both photoreceptors and retinal capillaries from radiation damage [11,12].Butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin–MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, (BuOE), is a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, that is also termed BMX-001, and is currently in multiple phase 1 and phase 2 human clinical trials. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ has shown protective effects against radiation-induced damage to the brain white matter and hippocampal neurogenesis [13,14].Our previous flight data showed a significant increase in apoptotic damage in the photoreceptors of flight mice compared to ground controls [4]. However, the pathophysiological consequences of cellular damage on photoreceptor and retinal function have not been well investigated. In the present study, mice were flown on SpX-24 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days to characterize the space environment-induced oxidative damage on ocular structure and retinal function using histochemistry, intraocular pressure (IOP), and electroretinography (ERG).

        "Title": "Effects of spaceflight on the brain",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nUnder conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.\nKeywords:\nPosition sense, Proprioception, Microgravity, Hypergravity, Parabolic flight",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception includes the senses of position, movement, force, heaviness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia2012). Arguably, the sense of position is the most important of these, since it is believed to contribute to our self-awareness (Cole1995) and it is an important contributor to the control of reaching movements (Desmurget et al.1995; Sarlegna and Sainsburg,2009).When considering methods of measuring position sense, there is currently no agreement over the preferred method of choice. This problem was recently addressed by Roach et al. (2023) who studied three commonly employed methods. These were two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning. Somewhat unexpectedly, each method produced a significantly different outcome. This led to the question, do we have more than one position sense?We have maintained a continuing interest in position sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that under conditions of weightlessness position sense is disturbed (Young et al.1984; Kenyon and Young1986; Weber et al.2020). It has led us to speculate about possible mechanisms responsible for the disturbance (Weber and Proske2022; Proske and Weber2023). In the light of the findings by Roach et al. (2023) we have decided to re-measure position sense during changes in gravity with each of the three methods and to look for differences in outcomes. Here we were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of position sense.Arguably the most influential study of the effects of changes in gravity on position sense is that by Lackner and DiZio (1992). Position sense was measured, using a two-arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in gravity during parabolic flight. However, rather than studying position sense directly, the authors made observations on the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al.1972). The method has the advantage of producing large changes in position sense for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied. Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those of Bock (1994) and Bringoux et al. (2012).The explanation preferred by Lackner & DiZio for their findings was that spindle output per unit stretch of arm muscles was influenced by G-level. Spindle rates can be altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimotor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibration responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects was based on the findings of Bringoux et al. (2012). They showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense.We have considered the possibility that the normal position signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, was likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske2023). In hypergravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the position signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint torque would lower the joint receptor component and therefore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values using the three methods and asked the question, were all three similarly affected by the changes in gravity?In the present study we have chosen to measure position sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. In view of the findings of Roach et al. (2023), we have considered the possibility of the existence of more than one position sense (Weber and Proske2022). It has led us to re-examine the question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense, more broadly. Participants were asked to measure position sense with each of the three methods, during periods of high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic flights. The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured with each method."

Additionally, with the emergence of commercial spaceflight, and European citizens already flying to space via these programs (e.g., Axiom Mission 1 and Blue Origin NS-16), there is an emerging opportunity to expand the population of European human subjects who can be studied in space.1The spaceflight environment is characterized by simultaneous exposure to stressors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity, isolation, and confinement within a closed environment.2Additionally, demand on the human body changes dynamically throughout different time points within a typical spaceflight mission, including pre-flight training, launch, extravehicular activity (EVA), landing, and post-flight rehabilitation.Figure 1.Open in a new tabEuropean astronaut populationThe distribution and population of European astronauts who have crossed the Kármán line (as of 9/20/21).(A) Geographically highlights the range of nationalities of European astronaut.(B) Shows the cumulative population of European astronauts over time, based on astronauts’ first mission into outer space.To date, studies of astronauts have shown that long-duration spaceflight induces multisystem physiological deconditioning, such as degradation of muscle and bone,3,4and detrimental changes to the eye, known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).5However, the precise mechanisms behind these responses are yet to be fully understood, largely due to the pace and practicalities of conducting comprehensive molecular studies in astronauts. Biological changes and associated medical risks during spaceflight missions, including in the commercial spaceflight setting, have recently been reviewed elsewhere.1,2,6The European Space Agency (ESA) and other space agencies have historically taken two complementary approaches to accelerate the understanding of molecular causes of biological changes in astronauts: translational research and space analog research. Translational research utilizes model organisms, including rodents, for molecular studies in space,7with the aim of understanding and countering detrimental physiological changes in astronauts. Space analog research utilizes facilities on Earth, which enable one to study individual aspects of the spaceflight environment without having to conduct studies in space. In the context of human research, this can include studying inactivity via bedrest studies and isolation via use of remote research stations, such as Concordia.8At the 2022 European Space Summit, the European Association of Space Explorers called for the development of European vehicles for transporting humans into space. Irrespective of whether or not this becomes a near- to medium-term reality, not only will ESA astronauts continue to regularly fly to the ISS but also they will fly in future exploration missions with international partners. One such example is the Artemis 2 mission to the moon, which could occur as early as 2025. The new generation of spacecraft used for these missions is likely to have highly limited cargo capacity; therefore, countermeasures, such as the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), used on board the ISS to suppress muscle and bone loss, may not be suitable.9Additionally, during these exploration missions, astronauts will venture beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) for the first time since the end of the Apollo program in 1972. Within LEO, the Earth’s magnetosphere provides partial protection against radiation; thus, humans venturing beyond this will experience greater exposure to solar particle event radiation and ionizing galactic cosmic radiation.2,10,11Although there is a lack of data on the molecular effects of the beyond LEO environment, an increase in radiation-associated health risks is almost a certainty.12,13,14Further considerations of future missions beyond LEO include health risks associated with unprecedentedly long-duration missions, lunar dust,15and EVA.2To the latter point, in the case of a Mars mission, the crew would likely need to safely perform EVA tasks in partial gravity (0.38g) following long-duration spaceflight, without the extensive rehabilitation support available on Earth.9,16With these new spacecraft and mission plans, it will be crucial to assess compatible countermeasures, while also gaining greater insight into the new challenges to human health posed by environments where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. A key challenge for translational research from a European standpoint is that the ESA does not currently have rodent research facilities in space, and it seems unlikely that such facilities will be rapidly developed for future exploration vehicles. Thus, new approaches that do not depend on rodent research facilities should be considered by ESA. In this context, a salient opportunity for space analog research is to harmonize measures and endpoints between research in analog environments and in space, increasing fidelity. For example, the efficacy of new countermeasures could be evaluated in both environments, and the efficacy of rehabilitation following long-duration spaceflight16could be studied and improved by testing novel rehabilitation techniques following long-duration bedrest. For these reasons, it could prove cost effective for the ESA to pursue an approach that focuses on improved capabilities for research on astronauts themselves and with increased harmonization of data and endpoint measures obtained in space and analog environments.On Earth, medicine has undergone a revolution through the widespread generation and analysis of multiple omic data types, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The strength of omic-based, data-driven approaches is their power to discover unanticipated effects, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and generate novel hypotheses to guide follow-up targeted studies.17,18In scientific studies on Earth, omic-derived molecular changes are regularly correlated with performance metrics to uncover molecular drivers of physiological change.19Omics have also become a valuable tool for clinical practice. For example, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (1) routinely offers all newborn babies blood spot test screening for several genomic-based disorders, including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism, and six inherited metabolic diseases; (2) recently launched a pilot project with Genomics to evaluate incorporating polygenic risk factor data into the clinical risk assessment for cardiovascular disease; and (3) recently approved use of personalized medications for treating cystic fibrosis based on the nature of the mutation(s) present in the patient’s cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) encoding gene. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how omics can rapidly be employed in combination with clinical data to determine risk of severe disease course, identify potential underlying mechanisms of susceptibility, and identify potential personalized treatments.20Although omics have become a significant part of scientific research and standard clinical practice on Earth, for humans in space, omics are a relatively new and untapped technology. Between March 2015 and March 2016, NASA conducted the seminal Twins Study. The study monitored an astronaut during a 1-year mission in space, while the astronaut’s identical twin remained on Earth as a control. Both subjects were comprehensively profiled using multiomic measures across several time points pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Spaceflight-induced changes were detected across multiple systems, with most of these alterations returning to baseline levels post-flight.21The longitudinal profiling of the NASA Twins Study and similar profiling on the recent short-duration SpaceX Inspiration4 commercial mission demonstrate that multiomics profiling of astronauts is feasible. Accordingly, NASA has recently announced that they have elected to add omics to the standard measures program for the ISS, which ESA astronauts can opt into. NASA’s standard measures program also routinely collects select physiological measures and select biomarkers from blood and urine; commercial spaceflight missions are similarly exploring these possibilities. For example, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), a partner of NASA’s Human Research Program, recently created a database for commercial spaceflight health data, including crew omics data from the Inspiration4 mission.22It is, therefore, important that the ESA also explores these new opportunities, leveraging existing expertise in European spaceflight omics23and facilities for human subjects research. To that end, the key question is how best to develop a routine longitudinal omics program for European astronauts and/or European spaceflight participants (SFPs).A routine omics collection program could be viewed as an initiative to develop a high-value data resource, which can be analyzed with ever-evolving big data approaches, thereby improving ESA’s artificial intelligence (AI) readiness. Access to sensitive data collected during the program would need to be controlled so that scientific research is supported, while protecting the rights of the subjects. Such a program could help to elucidate key molecular drivers behind spaceflight health issues, which could lead to improved risk quantification and approaches to spaceflight occupational health. One example of how this could be used is for the development of evidence-based recommendations on training and medical standards for spaceflight; these standards will become especially important as the spacefaring population increases in heterogeneity and begins to include humans with pre-existing conditions.1,6Furthermore, a routine omics program could be used as a basis for personalized medicine approaches. As an example, researchers have previously found that genetic variations in one-carbon metabolism genes may contribute to susceptibility to SANS in astronauts,24and other genomic studies have shown individual variability associated with spaceflight-relevant factors, including bone mineral density and radiation sensitivity.1Pre-flight genomic screening of astronauts, therefore, holds potential in developing personalized medicine approaches to risk assessment and countermeasures, including pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics.17,25,26Pharmacogenomics aims to optimize medication therapy, with respect to the patient’s genomic data, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. For example, a study of medication on board the ISS found that the metabolism of approximately a third of the drugs in the ISS repository were affected by polymorphic metabolizing enzymes.27Through further data collection, cargo could potentially be optimized to only include the best available medication for the individual crewmembers, reducing costs and adverse drug reaction/therapy failure risk.28Furthermore, omics could prove valuable for longitudinal health monitoring during spaceflight. For example, TRISH recently suggested that omics could be used alongside other datasets obtained via point-of-care (POC) devices to diagnose approximately one-third of NASA’s list of medical conditions that are of concern for deep-space missions.29Finally, discoveries obtained using human-research-derived omics data could benefit health on Earth. For example, the World Health Organization has listed physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, estimated to have been responsible for 9% of global premature mortality in 2008.30Mechanical unloading of the musculoskeletal system due to microgravity during spaceflight, or due to immobilization or reduced step count in analog environments, induces similar effects to physical inactivity, such as muscle atrophy and altered glucose handling; thus, discoveries and countermeasures developed for astronauts and/or SFPs could prove useful for terrestrial efforts against physical inactivity."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDuring the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU,\nRPB\n1,\nRPB2\n,\nCYTB\nand\nTEF1\n), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure.\nMethods\nTo provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction.

A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden.\nResult\nTelomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHuman spaceflight frequency has increased over the last decade, and with it, our grasp of its effects on human physiology. Despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. The space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity (e.g. weightlessness), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long-term human presence in space. Additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes (e.g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others [1]. Moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. Indeed, there appears to be a reduction in T cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of TNF-α, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5, etc.) associated with spaceflight [2].To date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. More recently, however, SpaceX launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. The present I4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post-flight and long-term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. This includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to Earth [3]. Both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. Previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with cardiovascular disease, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and increased overall mortality [4,5]. The NASA Twins Study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long-duration spaceflight and provided the first measures of telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis in astronauts [3,6]. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A and TET2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts. A retrospective study of 14 astronauts who flew shuttle missions has also shown an elevated presence of genetic abnormalities in CHIP-driver genes in the astronaut population [3,5,7].Here we investigated immune adaptations, telomere length dynamics, cell-free DNA release, genomic stability, single-cell transcriptomic analysis, and biochemical adaptations of the I4 crewmembers traveling into lower earth orbit over the course of 3 days, to determine the effects of short-duration spaceflight. It is imperative to study these adaptations in this context for future space missions, as prolonged space environment exposure could exponentially increase the rate of mutational burden [8], be it due to the inflammatory milieu resulting from spaceflight or the particular challenges of the space environment, such as microgravity and radiation exposure. Here, we leveraged the I4 mission to examine the development of genetic abnormalities in the astronauts by studying their physiological response to the demands of spaceflight and quantifying the genetic changes that are associated with spaceflight."

This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe increased accessibility of commercial and private spaceflight travel has made it imperative to understand the short- and long-term effects of space stressors on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)1–3provides open and FAIR4access to spaceflight and space-relevant biological studies from the past decades. Research enabled by OSDR data has revealed a complex network of molecular and physiological effects of spaceflight across living systems, from microbes to plants to mammals (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html). Most prior research using OSDR data has focused on model organisms such as rodents, worms, and fruit flies. These valuable measurements provide insight into the response of neuromuscular, immune, and developmental biosystems to the stressors and hazards of spaceflight. Integrating human in vivo data takes these studies one step further and map previously characterized model organisms’ biological responses to the limited knowledge on human physiology in space.The 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission collected a comprehensive atlas of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, providing a wealth of data to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In the current specialNaturepackage titled “The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,” a wide battery of analyses of these data have already provided valuable insights (Mason et al.,Nature. 2023).The I4 mission stands as a significant milestone, amassing an extensive collection of biological measurements from four civilian astronauts, thereby adding an invaluable series of datasets for deciphering the repercussions of spaceflight on human health. The open access of these datasets in the NASA OSDR provides a unique opportunity for the scientific community, citizen scientists, researchers, and students to continue using OSDR resources to further unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body. In this short article, we guide the readers on how to best conduct future analysis by presenting a series of vignettes illustrating pathways for accessing metadata and data from this rich resource through OSDR. We hope these guidelines will help the community contribute further to the vast compendium of findings already published from OSDR data and enable new hypotheses to be tested with both the human and model organism data.Compared to traditional model organisms used for research, one unique aspect of these data is the breadth of longitudinal measurements available from several human astronauts. Such temporal information for several individuals is unprecedented and pushes further the well-known “NASA’s Twin Study”5where a single astronaut was monitored over 340 days on the international space station, referred to as a “N of 1” experiment. In contrast, even though the duration of the I4 mission was much shorter (3 days), it was at a higher altitude (590 km vs. 420 km), and since it featured four individuals monitored with such biological depth, the data opens the door to new and innovative follow-up studies (e.g. Polaris Dawn missions).Incorporating environmental data with microbiome data and a wide variety of phenotypic and high-throughput sequencing assays provides a rare opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessment of short-term and long-term spaceflight effects on humans. These datasets also provide a much-needed ability to compare human spaceflight effects to the previously characterized spaceflight consequences in model organisms.The analyses conducted thus far on the I4 mission’s data have already yielded substantial revelations, shedding light on the intricate interplay between space stressors and the immune system, cell-specific responses to spaceflight, rapid microbial interchange of the crew, and detailed maps of the changes in the skin from astronauts (Overbey et al., Nature 2023; Tierney et al., Nature Microbiology 2023; Kim et al., Nature 2023). These analyses demonstrate the great potential of these data for future knowledge. The inclusion of multi-modal data, such as the blood datasets, which cover a diverse array of measurements (OSD-569, −570, −571, −575), also presents an exciting avenue for future exploration. This broader scope for analysis could unveil deeper connections between different biological responses and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the body’s adaptations to the space environment. Combining omics and medical assay data is the first step to understanding the biological significance of integrated findings. Translating them into actionable insights for space health will be our next step, which remains challenging but, for the first time, attainable.Looking ahead, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in the analysis of biomedical data from the I4 mission also holds great promise. With all OSDR data accessible in a cloud-based public repository, standardized metadata, and a robust API query system, this effort demonstrates AI readiness and empowers our user community to explore beyond current findings. The sheer volume and complexity of the data call for advanced computational approaches that can uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden. Powerful techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, hold the potential to extract meaningful but complex insights from the vast dataset, facilitating the identification of subtle trends and potential health risks associated with space travel. NASA OSDR’s commitment to FAIR practices ensures that researchers across the globe can harness the power of AI to conduct cutting-edge analyses, fostering collaboration and accelerating the pace of discovery. Finally, this work sets a precedent for space agencies to establish comprehensive, post-mission health monitoring programs, incorporating omics and medical assay data, while informing future mission planning and health risk mitigation strategies."

In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling.

        "Title": "Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTelomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.\nSubject terms:\nGenetics, Molecular biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionTelomeres are specialized nucleoprotein “caps” at the natural ends of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeres face two major challenges as a result of their physical location: the inability to replicate to the very end of linear DNA molecules (the end replication problem)1,2; and circumventing activation of inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) (the end protection problem)3,4. Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of highly conserved repetitive G-rich sequence (5’-TTAGGG/CCCTAA-3’)5–7, which in humans range in length from ~5 to 15 kb and end in 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs of ~30–500 nucleotides8,9. The 3’ single-stranded telomeric overhang serves as the substrate for telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto newly synthesized telomeres10. Telomeric 3’ overhangs also facilitate formation of protective terminal structural features termed t-loops11,12. Telomeres are dynamic structures associated with a myriad of telomere-specific and nonspecific proteins, six of which comprise the shelterin complex and include the telomere-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, which contributes to regulation of telomerase activity, t-loop formation, and protection of chromosome ends8,13–15.Normal human somatic cells have very low levels of telomerase activity, and thus telomeres shorten with continued cell division, as well as with oxidative stress and a variety of lifestyle factors, including chronic stressors and environmental exposures16–22. Telomere shortening is a key molecular driver of aging and determinant of age-related degenerative pathologies, including dementias, cardiovascular disease, and cancer23–25. Telomerase activity is sufficient to maintain telomere length only in highly proliferative populations like germ-line and stem cells, and the vast majority of cancers26. The remaining ~10–15% of human cancers maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent, recombination- mediated Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway27–29. ALT tumors display a number of distinguishing features, including heterogeneous telomere lengths, increased frequencies of telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ETCRs)30–32.Due to their repetitive and heterochromatic nature, telomeres were long regarded as silent, rather unremarkable regions of the genome. Therefore, discovery of TElomere Repeat-containing RNA, or TERRA, propelled the field into new areas of research and potential mechanisms of telomere maintenance33,34. TERRA, a presumed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) until recently35, ranges in length from ~ one hundred to over 9000 nucleotides and is transcribed from CpG islands within subtelomeric regions towards chromosomal termini by RNA Pol II, predominantly using the C-rich leading-strand as a template and producing 5’-UUAGGG-3’ transcripts33,36,37. TERRA is thought to accumulate preferentially at short telomeres, where it contributes to end-capping structure and function via regulation of telomere length and maintenance of genome stability38–40. TERRA can also indirectly associate with telomeres via shelterin proteins41,42, as well as interact with an array of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1)43,44. In telomerase-positive human cells, TERRA is primarily chromatin-associated (bound) and not polyadenylated (polyA-), while “free” (unbound) TERRA is polyadenylated at its 3’-end (polyA+) and represents ~7% of total TERRA33,36.TERRA can associate with telomeric DNA to generate classic R-loops, which are formed by the annealing of nascent TERRA “in-cis” to the complementary C-rich telomere strand when it fails to be released and remains bound as a 3-stranded structure, with the G-rich telomere strand displaced and forming G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. There is also evidence that 3-stranded telomeric R-loops can be formed by a recombinational-like mechanism, in which TERRA invades a telomeric duplex “in-trans”45. In either case, and similar to t-loops46, TERRA transcription and telomeric R-loops represent sources of replication stress and DNA damage specifically within telomeres47,48. A different TERRA-based structure occurs via the direct binding of TERRA to a C-rich single-stranded telomere tract forming a 2-stranded TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid. Telomeric R-loops and TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids promote homology-directed repair at telomeres and are common in ALT cells, likely due to an abundance of TERRA38. One of the hallmarks of ALT is loss of function of the chromatin remodeling complex ATRX/DAXX [α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and its physical partner death domain-associated protein (DAXX)]49, which results in decompaction of telomeric chromatin50, thereby facilitating increased transcription and elevated levels of TERRA in ALT cells compared to normal cells or telomerase positive tumors with functional ATRX/DAXX51,52. Indeed, significantly increased frequencies of telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids were found in human U2OS ALT (osteosarcoma) cells compared to HeLa telomerase positive (cervical carcinoma) cells. Furthermore, removal of telomere-bound TERRA in ALT cells via overexpression of the endogenous RNA endonuclease RnaseH1 resulted in telomere shortening. Together, these results support critical roles for TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in telomere protection and recombination-mediated elongation in ALT cells38. Interestingly, TERRA has also been implicated in telomere mobility, a capability that would facilitate the physical telomere-telomere interaction required for recombination events to occur38,53.Such an “end-view” of TERRA is consistent with strict inhibition of DDRs at telomeres, which prevents spurious end-joining and genomic instability54,55, but also renders telomeres refractory to repair when damage does occur within and/or near telomeric regions; e.g., telomeric regions are especially susceptible to oxidative damage due to their G-rich makeup56,57. Telomere site-specific endonucleases have been developed and employed to address the question of how, and even whether, double-strand breaks (DSBs) within telomeres are repaired58–60. We previously utilized transient transfection of the well-characterized endonuclease TRAS1-EN fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62in human BJ1-hTERT apparently normal fibroblasts, as well as in EJ-30 telomerase positive and U2OS (ALT) cancer cells, to evaluate telomeric DSBs specifically in G1-phase of the cell cycle63. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) provided a valuable biomarker of broken telomeres, as they represent co-localization of the well-established DSB marker gamma (γ)-H2AX at telomeres64. Importantly, induction of telomere-specific DSBs resulted in extensive tracks of resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA in all cell lines (independent of telomerase status), a previously proposed biomarker of the recombination dependent ALT pathway65,66. We posited that such highly reactive and exposed DNA “ends” were protected by binding complementary TERRA and forming telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids, so that they might persist into S/G2 for recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. Here, to better understand the role of telomeric RNA in the telomeric DDR, we investigated TERRA associated with ionizing radiation- and telomere specific-induced damage in normal human blood in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest), and in human U2OS (ALT) cells in vitro."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.\nSubject terms:\nComputational models, Image processing, Outcomes research, Risk factors, Systems analysis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionDuring both short- and long-duration spaceflight, the human body is exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment, including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, isolation, and confinement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceflight environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an Earth setting and often simplified due to the minimal resources and space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited clothing available)3. Moreover, significant physiological adaptations and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceflight exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular fluid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome), metabolic shifts, and mitochondrial and immune dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identified the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including fluid redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone fracture1,6–12.The body’s largest organ, the skin, is another key physiological system sensitive to environmental changes. Human skin serves multiple functions, including physical and immunological protection, supporting microbiota (containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) homeostasis, thermoregulation, fluid retention, and metabolism13–15. Also, since the skin is the outermost layer of the body and exposed to the direct, external environment, it is usually the first substrate affected by environmental changes an individual experiences, including environmental adaptations resulting from spaceflight. The skin serves as a unique organ for investigating the impacts of spaceflight on the human body as it encompasses a range of physiological elements, from surface microbiota and connective tissue to vasculatures, follicles, and the nervous and immune systems, alongside various skin cell types. It offers a comprehensive platform to understand the multifaceted effects of spaceflight. Unfortunately, few studies exist on the spaceflight environment’s impact on the skin, and observations to-date show that spaceflight may cause epidermal hypersensitivity and irritation, rarefaction of the cutaneous fiber network, and impaired epidermal proliferation and repair16–20. Nonetheless, the skin remains an understudied organ in the field of space biology; to date, fewer than ten astronaut case evaluations have been conducted3. Furthermore, only a few existing studies have examined transcript-level changes, and none of these studies has contextualized spatial or whole transcriptome gene expression or investigated the multiple omics components of skin adapting from spaceflight exposure3,21,22.Our study investigates skin samples collected from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission and, for the first time, explores the spatial-transcriptomic characterization of short-duration spaceflight’s impact on skin tissue. We comprehensively profiled skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using 4 mm skin punch biopsies from the crew members (n= 4) 44 days before launch (L-44) and 1 day after return (R + 1) of the 3-day mission. Tissue location specific gene expression levels were quantified using Nanostring GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) system across four regions of interest (ROI) targets, Outer Epidermis (OE) and Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA) compartments. From immunofluorescence images, we identified epidermis, dermis, and vascular area and subdivided epidermis ROIs into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer (OE) and basal layer (IE). In total, we analyzed 95 astronaut skin ROIs using the human whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA, 18,676 genes). We also correlate these transcript level findings with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from skin swabs obtained prior to biopsy, as well as single-cell sequencing data (10X multiome single-cell ATAC and gene expression (GEX) characterizations) from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMaintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example,\nFusobacteriota\n), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.\nSubject terms:\nMicrobiome, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Medical research",

        "Title": "Spatiotemporal expression and control of haemoglobin in space",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIt is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.\nSubject terms:\nRNA, Genetics research, Anaemia, Transcriptomics, Erythropoiesis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAn interesting phenomenon that has been observed in studies related to space medicine and biology is the clinical phenotype associated with space anaemia. In the environment on board the International Space Station, astronauts experience a reduction in their red blood cell mass, associated with anaemia, which is however resolved after a few months back on Earth1,2. The mechanism behind the incidence of space anaemia is still unknown, much like another important occurrence that deals with haemoglobin gene switching3. The globin gene switch has long been thought to act as a paradigm for studying gene switch mechanisms for both in vitro and in vivo clinical models. Perturbations in the globin switch may lead to important clinical disorders, also known as haemoglobinopathies, that include, amongst others, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassaemia4. The regulation and control of the globin genes are governed by a set of transcription factors and other key molecules that, when brought together in close proximity, will dynamically shift the beta-globin locus and express the globin genes in a developmental pattern. The fine and exquisite nature of the globin gene control, as well as their extensive studies to date on all -omic fronts, have made them the model of choice to study in one of the harshest environments that humans can experience.Erythropoiesis is a dynamic multi-step process5involving the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors to enucleated red blood cells. Under normal circumstances, a large number of transcription factors such as GATA-1, GATA-2, LMO2, FOG, C-MYB, TAL-1, BCL11A, RUNX-1 and PU.1 and KLF1 are involved in the formation of haematopoietic cell lineages that are in turn finely controlled and regulated in producing a subset of cells capable of carrying vast quantities of the haemoglobin protein for oxygen transport to all tissues6,7.In this study, we used multiple omic datasets retrieved from several different human astronaut missions using the powerful platform made available by NASA’s GeneLab8. This platform is now an established space omics database that provides a wealth of information linking molecular biology and genetics with space medical sciences. In particular, the full astronaut blood, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twins Study9,10was analysed for the globin gene expression profile as well as the extensive list of transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the globin gene switch mechanism.Our research uncovered two important conclusions. Firstly, exposing humans to orbiter effects resulted in a significantly down-regulated expression of all globin genes, seemingly confirming space anaemia as documented earlier1. The levels of expression were then returned back to normal post-flight. Key genes that play important roles in erythropoiesis were also highly perturbed during spaceflight, with some undergoing up-regulation and others down-regulated, indicating that space anaemia might occur as a combination of direct haemolysis coupled with reduced overall production of new, mature erythroid cells.Secondly, it was noted that an adult-to-fetal globin switch, similar to that observed in the amelioration of haemoglobinopathies on Earth, can be observed through the up-regulation and down-regulation of a number of genes, encoding for different globins, transcription factors and other key molecules that play a known role in globin switching mechanisms. This leads to the possible conclusion that the microgravity environment might elicit the mechanisms behind the developmental globin gene switch model and sheds an even more in-depth look at the key players involved in this intricate switch. These may constitute an important observation for those next frontier missions that look beyond the moon and further into deep space."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.\nSubject terms:\nEpigenomics, Immunogenetics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHuman spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)—an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4.Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46% of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth.Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells7–9. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response.Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune system’s response to spaceflight is still needed. With these needs in mind, we report here findings on the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, an all civilian-crewed commercial orbital spaceflight, including multi-omic, in-depth immune system profiling at the single-cell level for the four-member crew with a broad age range (29-50 years old at launch) and biomedical backgrounds. We longitudinally analyzed single-nucleus gene expression (snRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and single-cell T/B cell antigen receptor sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we integrated this multi-omics data with a clinical profile of a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and cytokine/chemokine/growth factor/metabolite measures. We also profiled cell frequencies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), biochemical profiling, differential gene/peak expression, enriched biological pathways, over-represented transcription factor binding site (TFBS), antibody isotype, mutation profiles of BCR/TCR, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma, and association with skin, oral, and nasal microbiome changes. Here, we provide a detailed report of these findings, illustrating a unique set of immune system changes induced by high-elevation spaceflight, and conclude with potential countermeasures derived from these data, all of which can guide and inform future studies and missions."

Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.\nSubject terms:\nAdaptive immunity, Innate immunity, Gene regulation in immune cells, Space physics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAstronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), such as on the international space station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction associated with the microgravity environment. Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated1–4or actual microgravity5–9. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity7,10, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function11. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV)3,7,12–15. In one study, viral shedding after 9–14 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity16. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space7.Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study17, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters ofnotch3for CD4+T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and inscl1a5/asct2, linked to activation, for CD8+T cells. A total of 50 of 62 assayed cytokines were also altered by spaceflight or landing17. During a recent multi-omic analysis, including bulk RNA and DNA methylation sequencing, of astronauts and mice in space, mouse organs such as the liver and kidney demonstrated reduced IFN signatures, coupled to altered methylation patterns of these gene sets, while muscles had increased IFNγ, IL-1, and TNF10. Serum inflammatory markers from 59 astronauts in this study (and in a similar companion study) showed increased VEGF-1, IGF-1, and IL-1 during spaceflight, which resolved upon returning to Earth4,10. This same study also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major response of different non-hematolymphoid tissues to spaceflight10. More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (18–22 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+T cell responses to Concanavalin A/anti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs18.Despite these important advances, the core fundamental mechanisms, genes, and pathways that are directly altered by microgravity to adversely impact immunity, including at single-cell resolution, are largely unknown. Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals19. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton19. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force20,21onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction.Here, using a common ground-based analog, the NASA developed low shear modeled microgravity Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)2,18,22, we examine in depth how short-term (25 hours) exposure to simulated microgravity impacts the human peripheral blood mononuclear immune system in detail at single-cell resolution. Combining this data with validation experiments from mice and crewmembers in LEO, as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify numerous core genes and pathways in immune cells that are altered by simulated microgravity or spaceflight, and identify numerous potential compounds that directly map onto immune cell transcriptional signatures in simulated microgravity."

By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.\nSubject terms:\nEpigenomics, Metabolomics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs spaceflight and long-term human missions become more attainable, minimally invasive approaches to monitor physiological responses to spaceflight in diverse populations will be key to preventing acute and long-term complications1. The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts2, yet there are scant studies of astronaut plasma proteomics. Previous plasma proteomic studies of long-duration spaceflight reported changes in platelet function, coagulation, hemostasis, immune function, and metabolism3–5. In addition, various ground-based analog studies (i.e. head-down bed rest) have reported blood proteomic changes including complement activation, acute inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombosis6,7. Moreover, da Silveira et al. demonstrated that mitochondrial disruption and oxidative stress were the key hubs for increased health risks7, based on miRNA biomarkers in plasma.Plasma-circulating extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and metabolites provide additional information regarding the cellular phenotype and state of distal organs and tissues8,9. EVPs are actively released into the peripheral circulation at concentrations of > 109vesicles/mL, and are demonstrated biomarkers in cancer8, traumatic brain injury10, and autoimmune diseases11. Thus, EVP cargo analysis could be used to monitor health risks associated with space exploration, such as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)12and thrombosis13,14, but studies of spaceflight-induced changes in EVP cargo have been limited15. Moreover, for metabolites, prior missions have focused on markers of bone metabolism and musculoskeletal deconditioning, including increased osteogenesis and resorption markers (e.g., osteocalcin, sclerostin, parathyroid hormone, osteoprotegerin, and RANKL) in the blood of crew members16–19, and could benefit from a wider profile. The decreased muscular activity associated with spaceflight leads to a loss of nitrogen and an inability to maintain whole-body protein synthesis rates, exacerbated by hypocaloric intake20, but this has not been examined in EVPs or metabolites in recent missions. Prior missions have also revealed spaceflight anemia, with circulating red blood cells and plasma volume decreases of 10–15%, leading to increased iron availability21, though the effect of these changes on EVP cargo is unknown.The NASA Twins study provided the first profile and multi-omic analysis of the plasma proteome, EVP proteome, and plasma metabolome, namely from a one-year, long-duration mission22. For that study, EVP protein cargo showed changes related to physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and the first indication of brain-derived proteins in plasma-circulating EVPs15. However, the NASA Twins study only used untargeted plasma proteomics (capturing 292 proteins) to discern an increased ratio of apolipoprotein B (APOB) to apolipoprotein A1 (APO1)22. Of the 60 plasma metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis, amino acid, fatty acid, ketone body, and pyrimidine metabolism, no significant changes for in-flight levels were found22. However, it is necessary to expand the NASA Twins study findings to an increased number of samples, larger coverage of metabolomics, broader coverage of plasma proteomics, longitudinal data of EVP proteomics, and a systematic integration and meta-analysis of secretome changes with other multi-omic data7.The SpaceX inspiration4 (i4) mission provided the first opportunity for such an expanded study, and it also was notable as the first all-civilian space flight mission, featuring 2 male and 2 female astronauts aged 29 to 50 years, who traveled into space for 3 days in orbit at 590 km altitude. We profiled the spaceflight secretome (plasma proteome and metabolome, and EVP proteome) of the i4 astronauts at three pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and three post-flight timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82). We performed differential and pathway enrichment analysis of the proteome and metabolome to reveal the biological landscape of the secretome changes induced by 3-day spaceflight. Then, we delineated the contribution of blood and immune cells by comparing secretome and transcriptomic profiles obtained from the i4 single-nuclei PBMC and whole-blood RNA-seq. We performed thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS) measurement assays, EVP immune cell marker profiling, Western blots, and ELISA to validate findings. The unique insight of integrating these different modalities (proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) in our study provides the largest comprehensive assessment of the systemic physiologic and secreted changes resulting from spaceflight exposure to date."

Numerous space organizations across the globe openly aspire toward landing humans on Mars in the coming decades, underscoring an overall international interest in what may be the next stage of human space exploration. Prominent examples include the SpaceX Mars program striving to initiate the first crewed Mars spaceflights in the late 2020s; the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology announcing the country’s goals to place humans on Mars in 2033; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States space agency) issuing the Authorization Act of 2017, which declares objectives to send humanity to Mars in the early 2030s; Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) publishing aims to send humans to Mars in the early 2040s; and the United Arab Emirates publishing the Mars 2117 Project, which outlines a one-hundred-year plan to construct habitable communities for humans on Mars. Thus, there is a motive for scientists across the world to study how the human body responds to spaceflight and to develop countermeasures that improve the health and safety of crewed interplanetary missions.Since the inception of human spaceflight, the duration that astronauts spend in space each mission has increased over time (Fig.1A). Despite this, to date, only eleven individuals have resided in space for more than 300 consecutive days. Pioneering crewed missions to Mars would see humans embarking through space for even longer consecutive periods of time and in radiation environments for which there is limited knowledge about the impact on human physiology, warranting improvements in the autonomous space telehealth field. The risk of an emergency medical occurrence during space missions has previously been estimated at approximately 0.06 per person-year, which roughly equates to one event every 2.4 years for a crew of seven1. Multiyear planetary missions would prevent resupply and medical evacuation options and hence would require fully autonomous telehealth and triage protocols.Fig. 1.

Astronauts are colored by the number of missions they have been on, and shapes represent astronaut sex (females are triangles and males are circles). The average time spent in space ranged from minutes to one month in the 1960s, and from one day to under six months in the 1970s. In the 1980s through 2000s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of between one week and one month in space per mission, but many astronauts spent more than three months in space. Subsequently, in the 2010s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of over three months in space per mission, whereas in the early 2020 s, there was the widest distribution of average time in space, ranging from ten minutes to six months.BThe number of astronauts who have been in space by nationality. Bar plot shows the number of astronauts by the year of their first mission whereas the pie chart shows the percentage of each nation’s contribution. Nations with only one astronaut to ever go to space are colored green (4%), nations with only between two and five astronauts to go to space are colored lime green (3%), and astronauts with multiple nationalities are colored yellow (1%). Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed.Various applications of artificial intelligence and molecular omics could likely advance the spaceflight telehealth field. Omics technologies allow for the quantification of large pools of biomolecules that influence the integrity and function of biology. Exploratory and untargeted omics techniques can measure analytes that are not predetermined. These studies can identify patterns of variance, which can generate new hypotheses. Additionally, integrating omics with metadata, including environmental and phenotypic measures, enhances the ability to establish robust links between environmental influences, omic variations, and phenotypic outcomes2. The NASA Twins Study integrated various omics platforms, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, and highlighted omics as a potential biomedical research platform that may one day translate into the development of precision spaceflight healthcare3. The ambitious project discovered more than 8600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between an astronaut who resided for almost one year on the International Space Station (ISS) and their identical twin who resided on Earth; it is possible that any permutation of the DEG list could uncover biochemical pathways that hold keys to the development of therapeutic supplements and lifestyle recommendations that better protect health in space3,4. In this paper, we will consider how the dawn of diversified human exploration of deeper space may benefit from sophisticated advances in spaceflight nutrition and health that may be met in part with the addition of routine standardized omics.Space omics efforts are now underway in multiple regions. In Japan, the “Living in Space” Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) program uncovers biological responses to the space environment at various levels, ranging from environmental microbiomes to stress responses in humans, using omics technologies. In Europe, the Space Omics Topical Team (TT) supports and generates omics approaches to space biology5, and there are visible efforts to promote further development of space omics research among ESA and ESA state members6. In the United States, examples of space omics-related campaigns include the Precision Health Initiative and Systems Biology Translational Project through the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) and the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research (CIPHER) project (“Human Research Program Update”, WH Paloski, Committee on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space (CBPSS) Virtual Fall Committee Meeting). The NASA GeneLab initiative provides an open access, collaborative analysis platform for space omics data collected across the world and unites international efforts through analysis working groups7. Canada operates terrestrial platforms to analyze human omics linked with biomedical data8, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has announced plans for national space omics research, in addition to already participating in international space omics projects. China and Russia are also publishing human space omics research9,10.Humans in spaceflight historically represented nations like the United Socialist Soviet Republic and the United States to a large degree (Fig.1B). After the first couple of decades of human spaceflight, nations like Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia have also been represented to a moderate degree (Fig.1B). Individuals who have entered space now represent, even if in smaller numbers, more than thirty other nations: Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.The Artemis program plans to soon reestablish a human presence on the Moon, for the first time in five decades, and construct a permanent lunar base to facilitate the future of human missions to Mars. Led by NASA and partner agencies JAXA, ESA, and CSA, the Artemis program includes signatories from about thirty countries and territories, reflecting on the theme of a more global human presence in space. Indeed, crewed missions to Mars would motivate philosophical thinking about humanity’s place in the universe, common to all humans. Many people believe such missions will only be enabled by worldwide collaboration due to the involvement of multiple countries and international organizations, the implications for many people across Earth, the sheer engineering demands, and the increasing global representation of space explorers11. Upcoming planetary missions will likely be multinational efforts, underscoring the need for global collaboration in regard to the science, culture, and ethics behind space exploration. A new age of human space omics may likewise require international input due to both the various cultural aspects and the added technological, ethical, and philosophical complexities of working with human subjects.International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) represents an international consortium of space omics scientists who formed after recognizing the need for standard guidelines in the emerging spaceflight omics discipline. ISSOP includes scientists with expertise across the full range of omics approaches who receive funding from academia, industry, and government agencies across a wide array of regions, including Japan, India, the Middle East, Canada, Europe, Russia, and the United States. By promoting communication exchange in the space omics discipline, ISSOP may be uniquely positioned to support the development of an informed framework early on that can help maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics.In this paper, we consider how a future of precision space healthcare could improve the safety of human health during long-term spaceflight. We then discuss how careful standardization of space omics data is one component that may help implement this goal. To this end, we propose the development of a human cell atlas under spaceflight environmental conditions that could assist as an openly available, global resource for foundational space life science research. We then consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the general discipline of human space omics, and how philosophical frameworks would likely need to be established with perspectives from international ethicists.Precision healthcare in spaceIn the coming years, the spaceflight field will likely observe diversification of the flying population, extended mission durations, and exposure to harsher radiation beyond LEO. These factors motivate an upgraded space healthcare model where nutritional, supplemental, and pharmaceutical decisions could be tailored to multiple characteristics12,13. On Earth, there are already applications of precision health, where healthcare is informed based on omics, environmental, and lifestyle factors14. It seems probable that as connections between omics and spaceflight health ailments are slowly elucidated, similar approaches could be implemented in space. The purpose of customizing spaceflight healthcare would not be to reduce spaceflight participation, but to promote the health of increasingly diverse participation that better reflects the sustained presence of the full inclusive range of humanity in space one day13.Countermeasure protocols for space missions can consist of evidence-based nutritional supplements, exercise regimes, stress-relieving techniques, and pharmacological interventions15. Moving forward, crew profiles could potentially improve medical risk assessment and countermeasures; optimize medical and nutritional payloads; increase crew safety and efficiency; and maximize the likelihood of mission success. In the next section, we will explore examples of how astronaut health and performance can be impacted by omic differences related to the metabolism of drugs, micronutrients, and macronutrients. We focus on metabolism because changes in mitochondria, the key hub of metabolism, are a fundamental biological feature of spaceflight16.We note that the provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health-related importance. As a result, scientists must cautiously avoid overassociating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. Indeed, most human gene association studies on Earth are associative with many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) providing initial results that failed to hold up upon further testing. The risk of overinterpretation is particularly relevant in the field of human space omics given the small sample sizes and the small number of studies3; the difficulty of securing suitable ground controls, both in omics and environment3,17; and the long number of years required to replicate findings. These problems are further amplified when studying the long-term effects of spaceflight outside of LEO. We emphasize that the following section mostly presents early evidence and even contradictions due to the current limitations of the human space omics field, and that much more work would be needed in the coming decades to assess the validity of the below preliminary findings and interpretations.Drug metabolism in spaceMedical kits onboard the ISS contain pharmaceuticals to cover various medical events and emergencies, including injuries, illnesses, infections, sleep disruptions, motion sickness, and cognitive and behavioral health conditions18. Documentation of medication usage has not been consistent, but studies suggest about 94% of crew members used medications at least once during space shuttle missions19. Despite the common use of medications to manage health concerns on orbit, few studies have explored how to refine pharmaceutical applications in the unique environment of space. Preliminary evidence suggests that spaceflight may introduce impurity products, alter the physical appearance, and quicken the degradation of certain drugs before their expiration dates20,21. Although these investigations have been severely limited without adequate ground controls, they have underlined the need to verify if any spaceflight factors may affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that determine the pharmaceutical safety and efficacy, and the mechanisms responsible for these effects22,23. These factors might include the space environment itself (such as chronic low-dose radiation) and/or confounding extraneous factors (such as temperature, humidity, and dosage repackaging commonly used to meet the limited volume constraints on space vehicles)18,22,24.Thorough metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how to better understand precision responses to such drugs. A recent pharmacogenetics study by the ESA demonstrated that allelic variation may influence the safety and effectiveness of how individual crew members metabolize drugs on the ISS. Researchers examined the 78 standard drugs permanently available on the ISS and found that the metabolism of 24 of them was significantly affected by individual variants in genetic polymorphism enzymes25. This discovery suggested that almost one-third of drugs on the ISS may warrant personal dose adjustments or alternative therapies for crew members who have allelic predispositions that can render them anywhere from poor metabolizers (with decreased drug clearance, increased plasma drug levels, and potential adverse drug response) to ultra-rapid metabolizers (with increased drug clearance, decreased plasma drug levels, and potential ineffective drug response). Populations throughout the world can have different frequencies of genetic polymorphism enzymes that affect drug metabolisms26; thus, pharmacogenetic screening of consenting astronauts from diverse backgrounds could better ensure equal representation27.Personal astronaut drug-metabolism profiles could be generated based on the two reaction phases of drug biotransformation. The first drug biotransformation reaction produces a more water-soluble and less active metabolite usually through the hydroxylating enzyme superfamily known as Cytochrome P450 (CYP450). This enzyme superfamily is believed to account for 75% of total drug metabolism28. Indeed, CYPs have recently been suggested to be altered in flight due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling29. Several CYP450 genes are highly polymorphic, producing enzyme variants that cause variability in drug-metabolizing effects between groups. During mission planning, CYP450 genetic variant profiles for consenting astronauts could be generated and cross-referenced with mission drug lists to prevent scenarios in which crew members would otherwise metabolize drugs in harmful or inefficient ways13. The second drug biotransformation is usually a conjugation reaction wherein a small molecule binds to the drug metabolite and increases its solubility for excretion. For this situation, consenting astronauts could assess their pre-mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents (such as glutathione, glycine, cysteine, arginine, and taurine) to inform their optimum conditions13.One concrete example of how CYP allelic variants could inform treatments during space exploration relates to acute radiation sickness (ARS)30. ARS is an accepted risk on orbit, and common medications to treat its primary symptoms of nausea and vomiting include ondansetron and granisetron, which are both metabolized differently in the liver based on individual CYP genetic polymorphisms. Specifically, the CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes ondansetron, and, hence, groups who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of the CYP2D6 pathway have a higher risk of still vomiting within one day of radiotherapy with ondansetron31. These groups may benefit from treating ARS with granisetron, which is instead metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme31. Another example of how CYP allelic variants could inform spaceflight therapies based on personal predispositions relates to sleep drugs, which are commonly used by crew. In fact, 78% of shuttle crew reported taking zolpidem and zaleplon, powerful sleep pills, for more than half of the nights of their missions32. CYP3A polymorphisms are known to affect zolpidem metabolism33, but not zaleplon metabolism25, and astronauts could use this knowledge to more safely tailor their sleep-related treatments.It may also be meaningful to investigate optimal doses of medications that are more tailored to the demanding lifestyles of astronauts. For example, unlike many individuals on Earth, astronauts on the ISS are occasionally awakened by alarms during scheduled sleeping shifts in order to perform emergency tasks that require effective cognitive and psychomotor capabilities34. A study at NASA Johnson Space Center found that subjects who consumed a higher dose of zolpidem before sleep experienced significantly reduced cognitive and psychomotor performance during emergency awakenings; however, they found no similar impairments in subjects who consumed the lower dose of zolpidem, the dose of zaleplon, or the placebo before sleep onset34. Hence, even though the approved doses of zolpidem and zaleplon may be fit for most terrestrial applications, the unique duties during spaceflight may warrant adjusted recommended dosages of these, and possibly other, approved medications.Even the metabolism of medications may be altered in spaceflight compared to on Earth. The kidneys, which play a major role in drug excretion, may reduce urine output during weightlessness35. The liver, which is the main organ that metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, may also behave differently between terrestrial and spaceflight conditions, although results have been conflicting: While some studies have reported an increase in hepatic blood flow and size during spaceflight36, other studies have suggested a decrease in hepatic metabolism in space, which may roughly correspond to a decrease in hepatic blood flow due to the hypovolemia that occurs on orbit37. Clear elucidation of potential differences between drug metabolism in terrestrial versus orbital conditions will require further investigation, and any reliable findings could eventually be integrated for improved aerospace healthcare recommendations27.Micronutrient metabolism in spaceRecent studies are elucidating tentative relationships between omics and micronutrient intake that may link to adverse health events in space. One key example of this is one-carbon metabolism, which involves the transfer of methyl groups from donors (such as folate, B12, choline, and betaine). We note that many of the donors are essential inputs that must be obtained from the diet. The enzymes that regulate one-carbon metabolism are produced from highly polymorphic methyltransferase genes; any possible ramifications for human spaceflight are only recently unfolding13.As an example, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a unique and distinctive clinical manifestation. It includes optic disk edema (swelling), choroidal folds, and focal areas of ischemic retina (cotton wool spots). This disease is believed to present in over 20% of astronauts both during and after short and long duration spaceflight38. With no known terrestrial analogue, evidence-based countermeasures are only recently emerging; these include lower body negative pressure and nutritional supplementation39, the latter of which could be further refined through omics studies. Indeed, one research group examined 49 astronauts and discovered that common variations in one-carbon metabolism genes, combined with lower levels of vitamins B2, B6, and B9, appeared to be associated with SANS40,41.In addition to poor neuro-ocular health, disordered one-carbon metabolism may play a role in bone fragility (with increased osteoclast activation and decreased osteoblast activity)13, hypertension (with increased intraocular pressure)42, and chromosome instability (with concurring folate deficiency increasing defective DNA repair)43. It is indicative that this single metabolic property may have wide-ranging impacts on some of the more perplexing health complications known to occur during spaceflight13. For these reasons, one-carbon metabolism is an example candidate for deeper research into a future precision space medicine approach.There is likewise preliminary evidence that prolonged radiation exposure may interact with genetic polymorphisms that alter micronutrient metabolism, predisposing to disease in space. For example, there is precursory evidence suggesting that the space environment partially contributes to altered iron metabolism in astronauts44. Iron overload is believed to occur more often in individuals with allelic variants for hemochromatosis (HFE)45. Simultaneously, urinary magnesium (Mg) levels are reported to decrease during space missions, with a slight majority of post-spaceflight astronauts presenting with levels below minimum clinical guidelines46. Taken together, these provisional observations suggest that astronauts with HFE allelic variants may develop unusually high levels of iron when exposed to the space environment, which may induce oxidative stress and unstable DNA47. Given that Mg repairs DNA damage48, further research may be justified to examine whether convergent Mg deficiencies could complete a dangerous aggregation of risk events in a subset of astronauts who are susceptible to this array of environment, omics, and dietary intake parameters13. DNA stability is a leading human safety concern in space and hence it seems meaningful to investigate whether consenting individuals can benefit from optimizing any essential dietary inputs with relevance to DNA repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles.The supplementation of Vitamin D, another important micronutrient, is regularly integrated into spaceflight nutrition programs49. While Vitamin D is well-known for its influence on bone production, it impacts several more biological processes, including immune system modulation. Its effect on immunity seems to be mediated by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), expressed by antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells50. Conversely, Vitamin D and VDR are necessary to maintain a healthy number of regulatory T cells51. Allelic variants of theVDRgene appear to be associated with better response to Vitamin D supplementation52, and allelic variants of genes (such as7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase(DHCR7), a gene related to sterol metabolism) are believed to be related to improved Vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance53. Therefore, poor Vitamin D status and metabolism of individuals during space missions, which already have inherent stressful elements, might negatively affect the immune systems of astronauts, and this could potentially be mitigated through precision omics profiles.Macronutrient metabolism in spaceDifferences in macronutrient consumption needs have been linked to variants in genes, such as theRetinoic acid receptor beta(RARB) gene, theDNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1(DRAM1) gene, and theFat mass and obesity-associated(FTO) gene54,55. Altogether, these variants appear to be associated with body composition, fat distribution, and obesity risk in relation to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein intake54,55. Initial studies have suggested that endocrine changes linked to spaceflight modify metabolism and strengthen its association with alterations in astronaut body composition and nutritional intake needs56. It may be possible that long-duration space voyages could exacerbate dietary deficits. The nutritional condition of astronauts appears to be affected by metabolic stress, changing gut flora, altered feeding behavior, vitamin insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalance57. Maintaining energy balance in space missions will likely be critical for maintaining body fat muscle homeostasis58.These early findings imply a possibility that prolonged space exposure and dietary deficits may interact with genetic polymorphisms in a subset of astronauts to promote unusual pathologies that could be prevented by better nutritional information and health plans based on thorough research in the spaceflight omics discipline. It may hence be valuable to properly investigate and characterize any relationships between micronutrients, macronutrients, pharmaceuticals, omics, and various spaceflight environmental factors. These relationships are complex and underline the critical usefulness for rigorous standardization of space omics data and metadata so that meta-analyses may one day disentangle more confidently which factors are linked to preventable diseases at both the group and individual levels during spaceflight.Standardized space omics collectionStandardization of space omics data and metadata would be an important component of a successful human space omics discipline. JAXA is currently conducting human liquid biopsy studies on the ISS. The main purpose of the studies is to investigate how the space environment affects humans at the tissue level. Besides fat and skin samples, which can be risky, whole-body solid tissue biopsies cannot typically be conducted in humans in space. As a result, the project proposes to perform minimally invasive liquid biopsies in astronauts. Liquid biopsies can detect cell-free components (microRNA, RNA, DNA, and extracellular vesicles) in the blood and scientists can estimate which tissues the cell components are derived from, allowing for full-body monitoring of omics responses. While solid biopsies only reflect a single time point of a single site on a single tissue, liquid biopsies can allow for a less invasive assessment of extracellular DNA and RNA in the plasma, which can represent molecular responses of the internal tissues in the body and can be obtained at repeated timepoints. The project proposes to collect astronaut blood samples at multiple time points before, during, and after living on the ISS. Murine and human plasma samples may be processed using the same processing protocol, thereby allowing for direct comparison of human and veterinary patients in a minimally invasive fashion for both species. These unique data collections are expected to enable cross-species integrative data analysis of space environment effects on mammals in a manner that is less technically and ethically complex than previous methods.Moving forward, the majority of sampling on astronauts would likely consist of liquid biopsy approaches and other non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures. Traditional tissue biopsies carry a risk of infection and localized pain which could compromise astronaut health and performance in physical tasks such as spacewalks. Furthermore, less invasive sampling methods are often quick to perform and do not require significant recovery periods between samples, which can allow for more frequent sampling and thus greater temporal resolution of omic changes throughout missions. The feasibility of orbital sampling and readout can be explored for various biological sources, such as saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and nasal discharge, some of which have been reviewed in the context of human spaceflight elsewhere59. An increase in capabilities for inflight omic processing and readout could also enable inflight interventions to maintain health, such as nutritional supplements based on gene regulatory changes related to metabolism of specific vitamins.New metadata normalization is another example of a rising standardization challenge that comes with the arrival of human space omics projects. Some key metadata parameters that should be collected from humans include environment, diet, nutrition, psychosocial dynamics, lifestyle, medical history, anthropometrics, and phenotypes13. Many of these metadata parameters have not been necessarily collected in space and hence have no standardization methods. For instance, wearable technology could be implemented to provide metadata of astronaut health, similar to fitness trackers that have been successfully used on Earth to measure various medical parameters, including increased insulin resistance, which has also been observed in spaceflight60,61. At the same time, metadata can be misused to identify individual astronauts, an ethical problem that, unlike in model organism studies, has to be addressed. With a mission to continuously improve recommended metadata normalization protocols for space omics data, ISSOP may help spark discussions needed to resolve some of these challenges.In addition to best efforts to standardize space omics studies62, increased resolution may help interpret allelic variants associated with disease risks by more precisely pinpointing cell types and states involved in biology. Achieving this goal relates back to our project exploring an example set of alleles that are putatively linked to protective mechanisms, and their implications for therapeutic compound discovery and improved spaceflight nutrition and lifestyle recommendations63. As described next, extending standardized approaches toward space omics data that is higher in resolution could enable the generation of cell space atlases, which could further push forward a developing field of precision space healthcare.Human cell space atlasTo date, bulk transcriptomic technologies, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays, have mostly been used to understand how spaceflight impacts physiology. These approaches have characterized physiology at the tissue level, composed of billions of diverse cells, rather than at the individual cell level. However, to obtain a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans, there is a need to increase the analysis resolution level. In the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), researchers recently collected high-resolution omics data from commercial astronauts during the Inspiration4 mission; the project included multi-omics spatial mapping, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq). Civilian missions may greatly contribute to advancing the spaceflight omics field, given that many commercial spaceflight participants have expressed voluntary interest in participating in space biomedical research and sharing data for biobanks and scientific publication64,65. These technological advances have created an unprecedented opportunity for in-depth molecular studies in space biology in the short- and middle-term future.In recent years, researchers on Earth have used high-resolution omics to create a plant cell atlas (PCA)66, mouse cell atlas (MCA)67, and human cell atlas (HCA)68. These initiatives aim to construct thorough spatial maps of all cells in organisms as references for research, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of disease69, and assist in the development of better therapies. Contemporary routine blood tests that provide rough counts of white and red blood cells could become acutely more informative if cell types and states can be discerned with finer granularity. This could lead to improved diagnostic tests that detect infectionsbeforeclinical symptoms are present, representing a shift from reactionary treatment of health issues towards a preventative approach69.As society becomes increasingly spacefaring, one can envision the development of parallel initiatives to the PCA, MCA, and HCA that are specific to the space environment (Fig.2). A plant, mouse, and human cell space atlas (PCSA, MCSA, and HCSA) could improve our understanding of how each system responds to spaceflight and hence enhance health monitoring capabilities during prolonged space missions. Having access to the different changes occurring at the spatial cell type level in key organs between ground control and flight conditions would allow researchers to better understand how cell-cell interactions are altered by spaceflight70,71,72.Fig. 2. Cell space atlas.Open in a new tabMulti-omic experiments, whether on Earth or in space, have a number of complexities when designing and comparing results to other published work. Namely, there are numerous models which could be leveraged to investigate the molecular (omic) changes in different organ systems using different technologies, which can then be processed and analyzed in numerous ways. Further, experiments conducted in space may be more influenced by environmental factors that are either regulated within the craft (such as oxygen) or not (such as radiation). These environmental factors are crucial to understanding results and can drastically vary by experiment. Given these complexities, understanding the environmental factors during a mission and the exact experimental design (including acquiring and analyzing the data), and standardizing them across agencies will be crucial to the development of aerospace multi omic analyses. Further, given the overall cost of these experiments as well as the limited resources to conduct them, this centralized and normalized database, which is accessible to other scientists, can assist our understanding of spaceflight risks, their counter measurements, and monitoring.These insights could therefore lead to a more detailed comprehension of how various botanical organisms, veterinarian patients, and human patients respond to spaceflight in order to design new and substantially more precise treatments as countermeasures for health in space. The cell space atlases could serve as openly available international resources developed at the start of the human space omics era that span multiple generations to come, not only to characterize cellular responses to spaceflight but also to investigate how cell cross-talk is altered when the system is exposed to extreme environmental conditions like space.Human and model organism cell space atlases could be constructed in a minimally invasive manner, using in vitro and ex vivo technologies. For example, tissue chips (organs on chips) could be viable options for high-resolution space omics studies73. In the past several years, a series of experiments have tested tissue chips on the ISS through the Tissue Chips in Space initiative, which is a partnership between the ISS National Lab and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes for Health (NIH)74. Tissue chips are composed of human cells grown on artificial 3D scaffolds to model the structure and function of human tissues, allowing researchers to assess how major organs and systems in the human body respond to the extreme environment of space. Real human tissues can also be studied in spaceflight following protocols similar to the Suture in Space initiative, where living tissue from biopsies are extracted and sutured together to serve as models to better understand physiological mechanisms in space, including wound repair and regeneration27. Engineers have already developed miniaturized equipment and automation procedures for tissue chips to be employed in low capacity during flight missions. ESA plans to develop a 3D bioprinter for the ISS that could generate human tissue constructs in microgravity to study the complexity of cellular component responses to the space environment27. In addition to their role in potentially developing cell space atlases, personalized chips and tissues could also be exposed to extreme environments before missions to assess individual risks, and then could be placed on spaceflight to monitor health changes and test prospective countermeasures.We note that the omics methods used to construct cell space atlases may depend on whether sample processing occurs during spaceflight and/or back in terrestrial labs. For example, scRNA-seq approaches require fresh material, whereas snRNA-seq approaches can use frozen samples75. Spaceflight restrictions may also limit omics approaches: For instance, methods may initially be proteomics-based on orbit to successfully accommodate compact equipment that can operate at low power13. This could potentially lead to the generation of a human protein space atlas that integrates spatial mapping of human proteomics into atlas efforts, paralleling the Human Protein Atlas project already initiated in terrestrial healthcare76.Overcoming these technical boundaries and optimizing the quality of these technically novel datasets would require input from experienced omics scientists with extensive knowledge about spaceflight biology. ISSOP is composed of members with stated missions to routinely update recommended sample processing guidelines for space omics datasets to allow for better harmonization of data and increased gain of knowledge77. Members have expertise related to the processing of multi-omics data samples, and several ISSOP members are prime contributors to the previously mentioned JAXA and NASA projects utilizing cutting-edge and high-resolution omics techniques. As a result, ISSOP could serve as a community that is integral for propelling the space omics field into the next stage of innovation with projects related to themes such as the construction of cell space atlases.Alongside the technical challenges of constructing a human cell atlas for spaceflight, the generation and usage of human space omics data poses considerable ethical, cultural, and legal challenges that would need to be carefully resolved through policy development. Indeed, one motivation of the current perspective paper is to provide examples of the upcoming ethical and legal complexities inherent to the nascent human space omics discipline in order to encourage earlier discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community.Ethical and policy considerationsAs a consequence of the increasing adoption of human omics research in space, it has become crucial to increase standardization of policies for regulating the collection, storage, access, and usage of astronauts’ (sometimes called spaceflight participants, or SFPs) omics data. Based on recommendations from a 2014 report by the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine)78, NASA instituted a policy (NPD 7170.1) regarding the collection and usage of genomic data for human research. However, we are not currently aware of other prominent space agencies - or commercial spaceflight companies - publishing public policies regarding astronaut or crew omics data. Notably, the United Nations recently formed a working group on “Space and Global Health”. In their draft resolution (A/AC.105/C.1/L.402), they encourage Member States to “establish a policy-enabled environment and governance mechanisms, with due consideration of legal and ethical issues, for removing barriers to the effective use of space-based technologies, including telemedicine solutions”. The current rarity of human omics collection and curation can be viewed as a barrier to the development and deployment of emerging space-based health technologies, including precision healthcare. Thus, in the following section, we consider legal and ethical challenges pertaining to policymaking in this context, concluding with some thoughts on how best to achieve balanced policies which support space omics research while protecting the rights of the participants (Fig.3). Ethical considerations of human omics research is an emerging area for spaceflight79,80,59, this is just part of the bigger picture of space ethics81, and human omics research on Earth82.Fig. 3. Ethics.Open in a new tabPolicies pertaining to the collection, storage, and usage of omics data from consenting astronauts and spaceflight participants would need to be carefully balanced. Thorough discussion amongst international ethicists could ensure that such policies are designed such that they are not so restrictive that they significantly limit the potential for scientific progress and improved occupational healthcare in space, and not so permissible that they expose participants to ethical harms.Dangers of restrictive policies: scientific potential unusedAs mentioned throughout this manuscript, standardized collection and curation of human space omics data has great potential to accelerate scientific research into human health in space and enable the deployment of precision medicine technologies to improve occupational healthcare during spaceflight missions. Therefore, underutilization of the scientific and healthcare potential for human space omics data is the primary danger of overly restrictive policies.Firstly, if policies restrict the operational usage of human space omics data in occupational health processes, such as countermeasure design and long-term health monitoring, the full potential for reducing health risks might not be realized. Consequently, this could endanger crew members, reduce likelihood of mission success, and potentially infringe upon the duty of care space agencies have for their astronaut employees. This duty of care includes not just the immediate health and safety of astronauts during missions, but also their long-term health due to occupational exposures such as cosmic radiation78.Secondly, if policies do not allow for sufficient data to be collected and processed from humans in space for research purposes, the pace of space life sciences research will be slower, with increased dependency on ground-based analogs. Similarly, restrictive policies for data accessibility/sharing would also slow the pace of research. When investigators contribute data to the scientific community through open-science initiatives, it can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. In the context of spaceflight omics data, the value of open-science has recently been demonstrated through a large-scale multi-omics analysis comparing datasets from the NASA GeneLab biorepository, to uncover mitochondrial dysregulation as a key hub of the biological response to spaceflight83. Biorepositories can be leveraged with “Big data” approaches, where patterns such as radiation sensitivity, can be learned via the application of machine learning methods to collections of multi-omics datasets84. With increased collection of omics data from humans in space, these kinds of approaches could be applied to human spaceflight, such as to predict susceptibility to radiation-based health issues in individual crewmembers85. Limiting accessibility to human space omics data creates a barrier to analysis efforts, thus every decrement from complete open access reduces the scientific utility of the data.A final consequence of restrictive policies is reductions in the scope and precision of the data provided to the wider scientific community. For the NASA Twins study, authors of one follow-up paper that accessed and reanalyzed the original study data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and structural genomic elements could not be included in the publication for confidentiality purposes86, thus limiting the scope of their public facing analysis. Regarding precision, efforts to anonymize and sanitize the data prior to data sharing - including data aggregation approaches and withholding metadata - could reduce the scientific utility, particularly as individual differences, such as gene variants associated with susceptibility to health issues, are essential information for unlocking precision healthcare approaches63.Dangers of permissible policies: exposure to ethical harmsOn the other hand, while scientific utilization of human space omics data could reduce health risks for crews, if policies are overly permissible, omics research could also lead to harm by exposing human subjects to ethical issues. In the case of space agencies, this would also infringe on their duty of care to their astronaut employees. Due to the familial nature of genomics, these issues may also affect family members. Notably, compared to typical terrestrial cohorts, many of these ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population; astronauts are easily identifiable due to their current rarity and status as public figures79.One ethical issue that is particularly amplified by the standing of astronauts is that of privacy. The term “genetic privacy” is used ubiquitously, yet privacy breaches could apply to any identifiable omic-based personal data. Privacy breaches would involve disclosure of this data against the will of the participants, which could lead to psychological harm. Specifically, policies may be considered overly permissible if they fail to account for the risks of identifiability from the full range of omic data types and data formats. It is well understood that individuals can be identified using genomics data, such as SNPs87. However, identification via other omic data types, such as transcriptomics88, proteomics89,90, microbiomics91, and combinations of omic types (multi-omics)92, is a developing area of the literature. Identifying specific participants becomes possible through “linkage attacks” when phenotypic information is available in addition to the omics data88. Due to the nature of astronauts as public figures, phenotypic information such as ethnicity, age, and biological sex is readily available to the public. The small population size also means that the number of possible matches is limited, increasing the likelihood of successful linkage attacks. Aside from linkage attacks, privacy may also be violated via attacks on the data storage system. Thus, policies may be considered overly permissible if they do not ensure appropriate security and safeguarding mechanisms against data breaches.Relating to the issue of privacy is the ethical issue of genetic discrimination, which refers to individuals receiving differential or unfair treatment based on their genetic data. Policies permitting space agencies to use omics data predictive of health issues, such as genetic variants, in astronaut selection or during processes such as flight assignment, could be seen as discriminatory. Indeed, many countries worldwide have enacted laws to prevent the use of genetic information in employment decisions93. It is worth noting that this is somewhat of a controversial and complex topic; for example, in the United States, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions, such as to withhold deploying troops with G6PD deficiency to locations which would require them to take antimalarial drugs, since doing so can cause life-threatening hemolytic reactions94. While the United States Space Force could present an interesting exception, NASA is not a branch of the military, so it is subject to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 2008 (GINA), and therefore it would seem that it cannot use omic information in assignment and employment decisions79, which is also aligned with the current NASA policy (NPD 7170.1). However, even with precision medicine approaches, sending an individual with a genetic predisposition to spaceflight-associated risks, such as radiation susceptibility, on a long-duration mission to Mars may still increase the likelihood of a serious medical incident. Thus, it has been suggested that omic information would be useful for spaceflight selection and assignment processes95. This presents an ethical dilemma, where on the one hand, using omic information for flight assignment without the individual’s consent could be seen as discriminatory, and on the other hand, not doing so could potentially endanger the crew and reduce likelihood of mission safety and success. An additional consideration here is that some spaceflight-relevant genetic mutations may be linked to certain populations on Earth, which raises further issues of equity63. Using omics for precision healthcare does appear to be supported under the current NASA policy and GINA80, and this could hopefully decrease health risks associated with individual differences during spaceflight missions to an acceptable level, while refraining from using omics information for employment selection and flight assignment. Altogether, this balance may align with what is perhaps the current consensus for an appropriate compromise, based on regulations in many regions worldwide.One further ethical issue that will be faced by space agencies and commercial spaceflight companies collecting astronaut omics is the risk of incidental findings80. For example, collection and analysis of astronaut omics data could reveal unexpected findings, such as predisposition to late onset Alzheimer’s disease. In some cases, these findings may not be medically actionable. Disclosing these findings to the astronaut could cause them and their family members psychological harm. Policies would be seen as overly permissible if they do not factor in the risk of incidental findings and fail to implement appropriate and clear procedures for disclosure and genetic counseling.Keys to developing balanced policiesUltimately, policymaking for human space omics should be considered as a balancing act between developing policies that are not so overly restrictive that they limit the scientific potential of the data, and not so overly permissible that they invoke risk and expose participants and their families to harm. Standardization of policies could ensure that an appropriate balance is struck, safeguarding against ethical risks, while enabling appropriate accessibility for scientific and healthcare utilization of the data. This need for balance is embedded into the mixed role of space agencies, as research institutions and clinical care providers for astronaut employees80. While each dataset may still need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as for assessing identifiability of the data, clear policy frameworks could reduce bias and help to prevent unwarranted delays associated with unstandardized policy. As the number of humans and enterprises in space increases, and the understanding of omics increases in the context of ethical issues including privacy and discrimination, standards will need to be continually reassessed and updated.It is worth noting that while ethical challenges such as privacy are certainly amplified at present by the relatively unique standing of astronauts as a small cohort of figures in the public spotlight, to some extent, these issues are also shared by rare disease cohorts and elite athlete cohorts on Earth, and so existing policies in areas including handling incidental findings and data sharing appear to present an apt starting point for discussion96.It is essential that standardization of policymaking for human space omics be considered with an international perspective, as space agencies and commercial companies are subject to different laws based on geographical region, and may also be influenced by cultural differences81,97. For example, laws surrounding genetic discrimination and handling of incidental findings vary internationally93,98. Where appropriate, policies should aim to find harmonious solutions within the framework of internationally established legislation, such as the Declaration of Helsinki99, respecting the rights of the human data subjects while giving careful consideration to the specific challenges of the astronaut or crew population and the societal role of human spaceflight. On the ISS, the IGA (intergovernmental agreement) extends the jurisdiction of countries to their registered elements and personnel; for example, European law applies to European astronauts and the Columbus laboratory module on the ISS, with the existence of member state national laws adding further complexity59. Conversely, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) is a review board between international partners to ensure that all human subject research onboard the ISS is conducted ethically according to internationally agreed principles. It is likely that future missions, including commercial missions involving multi-national participants, will require similar navigation of international laws to create policies. This need to design harmonious international policy raises concerns over fairness; for example, if a country has more restrictive laws in areas such as data protection, it may become challenging for citizens of that country to participate in international space missions, omic studies, and omic-based technologies such as precision healthcare.Similarly, given the role of international collaboration in human spaceflight research, establishing clear and harmonious policies for lawful sharing and processing of human space omics data will be crucial100. Where human space omics data is deemed to be identifiable, databases should adhere to high standards of security, and access levels or other technical solutions for reducing ethical harm risks should be considered101. For example, data sanitization methods can manipulate the data to reduce the risk of identification88, but should be balanced against the potential loss of scientific utility. Additionally, federated approaches102, such as federating learning for training AI models without moving the data across jurisdictions, could prove useful103,104. In adherence to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles105, human space omics data should be as “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, in order to maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the participants.Furthermore, an important aspect of developing appropriate policies will be striving for meaningful informed consent from participants, both in terms of consenting to venture into space, and consenting to the collection, usage, and sharing of their omics data. To the former point, omics technologies, such as predicted risk based on individual differences, could help to provide participants with additional data, enabling greater decision autonomy to improve the informed consent process for space travel. Broad consent has been proposed as a potential solution to gain consent in the context of omics research, where it may be hard to define future uses of the data at a granular level, and the identifiability risks of different omics data types may be challenging to accurately quantify106. When carefully implemented, it has been argued that broad consent may be an appropriate choice for obtaining consent in the context of space omics studies and has been used in the recent commercial spaceflight health data repository established by the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank and the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH)65.Discussions regarding the development of appropriate policies need to commence early, so that anticipatory policies are ready as the science is ready80. With deep molecular profiling of astronauts now at the forefront of space biology research, and a key part of the climate of commercial spaceflight and ambitious missions outside of LEO, now would seem the opportune time to kick-start discussions into appropriate policy design. ISSOP, with its international membership and links to NASA GeneLab and the ESA Space Omics Topical Team, is well positioned to help guide standardization of policy-making regarding astronaut or commercial crews’ omics data, particularly from a scientific perspective. ISSOP can work closely with groups such as the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH) to merge expertise in spaceflight omics research and terrestrial omics policymaking, which could help to ensure that policies maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the astronauts and crews."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nSpaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.\nMethods\nTo address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.\nResults\nKey biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThroughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions.As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17.In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions."

        "Title": "Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-omic, physiological and morphological study into spaceflight-induced renal dysfunction",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMissions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.\nSubject terms:\nNephrons, Renal calculi, Thrombotic microangiopathies, Sequencing, Mass spectrometry",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of commercial spaceflight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory ‘Deep Space’ missions. The first of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars Missions, will for the first-time place humans outside of Earth’s protective magnetic field exposed to significant quantities of unmitigated space radiation and weightlessness for many months to years at a time.The health effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) spaceflight (e.g. the International Space Station) are multiple, with much of the research communities’ intense focus centred on the musculoskeletal, neurological, ocular and cardiovascular degeneration that can manifest as early as a few weeks into a mission. Notably, the effects of LEO spaceflight on many other organ systems are less clear, with indispensable organs such as the kidneys receiving relatively little attention in the absence of overt symptoms. However, in the face of extended periods of deep space travel health issues may only present with late onset due to cloaked subclinical pathophysiology and chronic damage eating into the extensive functional reserves of such organs.The kidneys are critical in regulating blood pressure, by controlling both the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium chloride and water from the urine. In microgravity, the cephalad redistribution of blood volume with the concomitant decrease in the pressure gradient should reduce kidney perfusion. In turn, a lower perfusion pressure within the renal artery should lead to a greater release of renin and activation of the RAAS. However, studies show a marked reduction of diuresis and natriuresis in space with the RAAS, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increasing through unknown mechanisms1–3. These unexplained effects, be they mediated through known homeostatic mechanisms, or more theoretical ones, such as tensegrity4, are germane to kidney stone formation (i.e. nephrolithiasis). Astronauts have an unusually high rate of kidney stone formation, with 1-year post-flight astronauts experiencing incidence rates of 2–7 times that of pre-flight estimates, and in-flight risk estimated to be double that again5. This is of mission critical significance, one Soviet in-flight renal stone episode nearly caused a mission termination due to the severe symptoms, but was relieved by spontaneous stone passage by the cosmonaut just before an urgent deorbit was initiated6. It has been demonstrated that spaceflight associated changes in urinary biochemistry favour kidney stone formation7–9. Microgravity may have a direct effect on the crystallisation and nucleation of nascent kidney stones10, but this is dwarfed by the net biochemical urinary changes historically attributed to the microgravity-induced bone demineralisation observed in spaceflight. A school of thought that has led to a paucity of research into other pathophysiological phenomena that may be contributing to the unusually high incidence of nephrolithiasis.The kidney is a plastic organ, and is capable of dynamically remodelling the architecture of the nephron in response to changes in blood pressure or dietary potassium. An 18 day potassium-free diet resulted in a 31% increase in rat kidney weight, which was mainly seen in the medullary collecting duct11. Changes in the size of nephron segments in wild type mice have been observed using advanced imaging techniques in a period as short as three days12. So, it is plausible that spaceflight-induced shifts in fluid and electrolyte handling could precipitate maladaptive remodelling events that contribute to the underlying pathophysiology.In addition to the well-studied environmental stressor of microgravity, deep space missions beyond the protection of the geomagnetosphere (the Van Allen belts) are exposed to space radiation. Space radiation comprises both intermittent events (e.g. Solar Particle Events or Solar Proton Events) with the most energetic being a Coronal Mass Ejection and Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), with GCR having the most significant health impacts.There is concern regarding the carcinogenic effect of GCR exposure in the planned Mars Missions. However, the kidney is an exquisitely radiation sensitive organ; it is the dose limiting organ in abdominal radiotherapy13. Chronic kidney dysfunction can occur with acute low linear energy transfer (LET) γ-radiation doses as low as <0.5 Gy14, the LET dose expected on a Mars Mission. However, GCR comprises low-LET x- and γ-rays with protons and high energy ‘HZE’ ions of heavier elements (e.g. silicon, titanium, iron). It has been established that exposure to HZE ions results in mitochondrial damage15,16. The renal proximal tubule is heavily dependent on mitochondrial respiration17and is one of the main tubular segments in which damage is associated with kidney failure18. Indeed, proximal tubular injury is a prominent histological feature in medical (low-LET) radiation nephropathy19. Due to their dependence on mitochondrial aerobic respiration, proximal tubular cells are extremely vulnerable to mitochondrial damage that we would expect from HZE exposure in addition to low-LET radiation damage.We hypothesised that the biochemical urinary changes seen in spaceflight might reflect functional and morphological changes detectable in the kidney secondary to microgravity, possibly due to abnormal renal perfusion.Further, we hypothesised that GCR exposure will cause mitochondrial and therefore proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to tissue damage and potentially irreversible loss of renal function, in addition to the known micro and macrovascular damage caused by GCR.In order to explore these questions, we took a pan-omics approach incorporating anatomical and physiological parameters from 20 independent human and rodent spaceflight missions/simulations that had extant data and/or samples from which we could generate novel data (Fig.1).Fig. 1.

        "Title": "Spaceflight induces changes in gene expression profiles linked to insulin and estrogen",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOrganismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including\nDrosophila\nand\nC. elegans\n. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.\nSubject terms:\nSystems biology, Computational biology and bioinformatics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWe have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts6,7. Sex differences play a role in diseases and metabolism both on Earth and in space8. Some of these differences may be attributed to sex hormones. Estrogens play a variety of roles and serve many functions in women’s lives. Besides being a reproductive hormone, estrogen is involved in metabolism as well as in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems9. Estrogen signaling activates membrane and nuclear receptors in both canonical and non-canonical ways to modulate metabolism, and promote growth, proliferation, and differentiation of diverse cell types10,11. Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR212but whose ligands are unknown. ESRRA also has DNA sequence homology to the estrogen receptor and can be activated by phytoestrogens (i.e. genistein)13. These receptors play pivotal roles in metabolism, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and mitochondrial function12. Besides that, an unbalanced ratio of these receptors may have an impact on metabolism14. Additionally, estrogen and insulin combine in controlling metabolic pathways. In animal models, knockout of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (ESR1) in both male and female mice results in insulin resistance and dysglycemia15–17. Estrogen receptors promote pancreatic cell survival, enhance insulin production, and improve insulin sensitivity18,19. Female and maleESR1−/− mice both display reduced GLUT4 expression, further emphasizing the role of estrogen in glycemic control14. Clinically, compared to premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have an increased risk of adverse metabolic profiles such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid profiles, increased android fat deposition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis20. Estrogens also positively correlate with bone and muscle mass and are protective against disuse atrophy21. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that insulin and estrogen signaling are key pathways regulating health in space.The amount of knowledge in the literature about how insulin and estrogen signaling and related pathways change during spaceflight is currently sparse. Our preliminary findings reported possible insulin and estrogen signaling alteration during spaceflight22,23. A few published studies show insulin resistance parameters may change during spaceflight but data are conflicting, suggesting either decreased insulin or no change24,25. Similarly, data on estrogen signaling are conflicting with one study revealing downregulation ofESR1andESR2in the uterus26whereas a recent study found no alterations in estrogen receptor expression in rodent ovaries27. To address these gaps in our knowledge of insulin and estrogen signaling in response to spaceflight we examined these signaling pathways across multiple tissues in rodents from the same mission as well as in a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants/astronauts. Our results indicate significant changes in these pathways in response to spaceflight in both mice and people. These observations lay the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight as well as highlighting insulin and estrogen signaling as potential targets for countermeasures in future spaceflight missions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumankind has entered a new chapter of deep space exploration, with numerous institutions worldwide publicly aspiring toward a sustainable human presence on the Moon and Mars, which is also broadening the diversity of humans in space. In the past two years, the first person with a prosthetic leg entered space (Inspiration4), and the first person with a physical disability was selected for professional astronaut training by the European Space Agency (ESA). The next few years of spaceflight also feature planned missions to the circumlunar environment after a half-century hiatus, including the first crewed commercial lunar flyby (a team of artists and civilians for the dearMoon project), further broadening the range of people going into space. Moreover, while a steady increase in female space explorers began in 1982, the first mission to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon will finally occur in the Artemis III mission (Fig.1A), coincident with a broadening of the age ranges (Fig.1B) and mission durations (Fig.1C) of the astronauts.Fig. 1. Increasing time and breadth of astronauts.Open in a new tabAThe cumulative number of astronauts who have been in space, plotted by the year of their first mission.BBoxplots representing the age of astronauts on their first mission plotted by the decade of their first mission.CBoxplots representing the cumulative amount of time an astronaut spent in space plotted against the number of missions in which they have participated. Blue signifies male and pink signifies female astronauts in all plots. Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed.Of note, only 24 humans have voyaged into the more hazardous conditions outside low-Earth orbit (LEO), all during the Apollo program. The longest Apollo mission lasted only 12 days, and all adventurers were white men between ages 35 and 47, all of whom had passed rigorous physical fitness tests. Consequently, the objective of sending humankind to unexplored horizons over unmatched timescales evokes critical questions about how the human body will respond to new extremes, as well as how to best protect the health of the broader space-faring population. In the coming decades, public and professional space explorers will likely embark on multi-year missions to the Moon and Mars, and this can lead to a more equitable vision of crewed space exploration. Specifically, the space community can democratize vital aspects of spaceflight, ranging from tailored space suit designs, precision health recommendations, and customized countermeasures1,2. Risks for these crews include radiation-induced cancers, space-induced osteopenia, challenges with pregnancy and child development, and changes for human bodies in Martian- and Lunar-based communities.The same motivations that drive precision healthcare on Earth could be useful for these new populations in space, where molecular data could be employed to guide therapy and mission recommendations. Multipronged countermeasures that are both environmental (such as advanced spacesuits, spacecrafts, and space habitats) and biomedical (such as omics-based nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations) likely represent the best contenders to optimize health across a more inclusive gamut of humanity in space. In this paper, we highlight omics technologies as one potential component toward improving prospective health countermeasures in space2.Omics modeling tools assess multiple biological responses (including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, epitranscriptomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) that can converge into useful solutions for mitigating spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning. Indeed, omics-based recommendations can be integrated alongside other countermeasures to sustain human health in space, and near real-time health monitoring in space could also one day incorporate omics3. We review an example set of published alleles that appear to be linked to health-protective effects, with relevance both on Earth and in space. Basic research into the protective mechanisms of such alleles may translate into improved therapeutic compound discovery and better-informed nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations, not only for space explorers, but also for those who work in challenging conditions on Earth. We conclude by discussing some of the significant scientific and ethical challenges related to these themes."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlanning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (\nTriticum aestivum\nL.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.\nKeywords:\nTriticum aestivum\nL., wheat kernel, starch granules, growing in space conditions, space station, hyperspectral imaging",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWhen planning piloting beyond our planet and long-term space exploration, the possibility of obtaining food in a new place is taken into account, because delivery to Mars, the Moon, or a space station will be unreasonably high in cost, long, and irregular [1]. Therefore, ongoing work is underway to improve greenhouses with a controlled environment to ensure sustainable food security, as well as research into plants suitable for such conditions, primarily dwarf plants, and those with accelerated development [2]. Plants are selected that are resistant to high levels of ethylene, with a short period of obtaining marketable products, compact size, high productivity, and self-reproduction (from seed to seed) [3]. Plants in space can serve not only as a source of food, but also for the in situ production of pharmaceuticals, air regeneration, water recycling, and improving the mental health of astronauts [4,5,6].In near space conditions, technologies have already been developed for producing plants from seed to seed using model plants, for example,Arabidopsis thaliana[7] andBrassica rapa[8], as well as cultivated annual plants of various families.The main crops consumed by humans are wheat, rice, corn, and sorghum [9]. Previously, attempts to grow cereals were sporadic and often ended in failure [2,10]. Currently, methods for cultivating wheat [11,12] have been developed (sorghum, due to the absence of dwarf forms, remains not yet relevant). The breakthrough in the cultivation of these crops is associated with overcoming pollination problems associated with certain development issues and gas requirements, particularly ethylene [13].Currently, the range of dwarf forms of rice and wheat makes it possible to achieve sustainable results, both on the ISS [10] and on the name of the Tiangong Chinese station [14].Kernel parameters such as length, width, weight, and shape make the most significant contribution in yield assessment [15]. The composition and ratio of different types of starch grains in the endosperm, as well as the protein content, mainly related to the quantity and characteristics of the formation of the aleurone layer, determine the quality criteria of the resulting flour and other processed products [2]. Quality assessment based on completion and the symmetry of kernels makes flour production predictable.Despite the fact that the very issue of obtaining a crop of cereals grown under near space conditions has now already been resolved, even with the use of genetic analysis [16,17], the issue of assessing crop quality, and, in particular, the symmetry of the grains still remains unstudied.The quality of the harvest is already checked on Earth. To identify clear patterns and long-term consequences, it is necessary to create express methods for diagnosing seed quality already in orbit. This must be accompanied by the development of non-destructive assessment methods to maintain the feasibility of using seeds in experiments. One such method could be phenotypic assessment and assessment of shape and color based on various pre-assessed indices. There have not yet been any studies on the asymmetry of plant organs grown in space, and we could not find the results of using hyperspectral analysis for these purposes.Due to the characteristics of cultivation and the possible action of various factors, wheat, grown in a growth chamber with conditionally full compliance with temperature, lighting, and humidity on the ISS, will be subject to a number of stressful influences to which they are poorly adapted: 24 h light; a constant, relatively warm temperature; and poor light quality. The major difference between the two environments is gravity. Because the wheat plants have phototropism, the effects on gravitropism on plant development were studied. Kernels of smaller weight, length, width, area, and perimeter will be formed in a such condition. This assumption was designated as hypothesis A.It was also hypothesized that the level of wheat kernel asymmetry would be higher on the ISS board (hypothesis B). A visual method for assessing the asymmetry of the kernel on a cross section of a kernel was previously proposed [18]. However, since the amount of grain collected on the ISS was limited, it was also necessary to develop a method for asymmetry evaluation without cutting into these unique accessions. A hypothesis was also assumed (hypothesis C) that there is a relationship between the asymmetry of the kernel and its main parameters, and the stronger the asymmetry, the lower the weight, since asymmetry is probably characteristic of puny (unfulfilled, immature) kernels."

        "Title": "Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce,\nLactuca sativa\ncv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log\n10\nCFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.\nKeywords:\nlettuce, microgravity, ISS, phyllosphere, rhizosphere, space, microbes",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionCrop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (MacElroy et al., 1992;Kliss et al., 2000). Fresh produce can be grownin situto supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005;Morrow and Remiker, 2009).The first Veggie plant growth chamber was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in April, 2014 along with eighteen plant (rooting) pillows for the VEG-01 experiment. Veggie is a simple plant growth facility that uses LED lights and fans to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. A transparent, extensible bellows attached to the light unit via magnets contains the growing plants and any debris, and directs air flow from the bottom of the canopy to the top of the growth volume (Figure 1). Screens remove large particles from the cabin air before it passes through the plant growth chamber, however, no level of filtration is present, so plants growing in Veggie are exposed to any microbial or chemical constituents present in the ISS environment. More details about the Veggie facility can be found inMassa et al. (2016). For the VEG-01 and VEG-03 demonstration tests, plants were grown from seeds in plant pillows. Plant pillows are small growing bags that interact with a root mat water reservoir on the Veggie baseplate. Pillows contain a calcined clay substrate mixed with controlled release fertilizer and wicks for seed attachment. Surface sanitized seeds are glued into these plant pillow wicks, and pillows are packaged for flight under sterile air. Further details of seed and pillow preparation are provided byMassa et al. (2017b).FIGURE 1.Open in a new tabVeggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off(left)and red light panel on(right). Bellows are in the up position.A major focus of our research in the past several years has been to identify crop candidates with high potential for dietary supplementation, given the constraints associated with the current space diet. Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) (Cooper, 2013). Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO2concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings (Richards et al., 2004,2006). While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited (McKeehen et al., 1996;Wheeler et al., 1996,1997). In order to utilize “pick-and-eat” produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO2concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics (Sublett et al., 2018). Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients (Tibbitts, 1979;Gislerød and Mortensen, 1990).Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants (Hummerick et al., 2010). We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes (Hummerick et al., 2011). Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces (Lindow and Brandl, 2003). A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed (Heaton and Jones, 2008;Leff and Fierer, 2013;Oyinlola et al., 2017).Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight (Borchers et al., 2002). Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables (Heaton and Jones, 2008;Leff and Fierer, 2013). The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for non-thermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is <2 × 104colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or <1 × 104on two out of five samples (Perchonok et al., 2012) however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS (Hummerick et al., 2010,2011). Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at −80°C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 × 103– 8.7 × 105. When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower (Holvoet et al., 2015;Wood et al., 2015;Fröhling et al., 2018; Hummerick et al., unpublished data).However, not all microorganisms can be cultured in the laboratory and alternate methods of community characterization are needed (Byrd et al., 1991;Schaule et al., 1993;Kalmbach et al., 1997). Genomic DNA analysis using whole genome or amplicon sequencing provides the capability of identifying 98–99% of the microbes present in a complex, heterogeneous microbial community. With the current advances in technology, the Illumina MiSeq provided a platform for capturing the community structure of the leaf and root material returned from the ISS and for the ground control samples. Identifying the community makeup is the first step in understanding the complex structure and interactions between mutualistic or symbiotic partners in plant growth systems.The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption."

        "Title": "Natural variation in the expression of ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine in Arabidopsis.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPolyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that\nArabidopsis thaliana\naccessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg\nerecta\n(L\ner\n) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in\nORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1\n(\nOCT1\n) is at least partially responsible for this difference.\nOCT1\nexpression was higher in Cvi than in L\ner\n, and\noct1\nmutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In\noct1\nmutants transformed with an ectopic copy of\nOCT1\noriginating from either Cvi or L\ner\n, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased\nOCT1\nexpression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPolyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species includingArabidopsis thaliana(Shevyakovaet al., 2001;Knottet al., 2007). Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins (Bagni and Tassoni, 2001). Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, seeHussainet al., 2011).Polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth (Cuevaset al., 2008;Aletet al., 2011;Wanget al., 2011). Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions (Liuet al., 2000;Takahashiet al., 2003;Tang and Newton, 2005). They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses (Obata and Fernie, 2012). Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H2O2(Tisiet al., 2011). Although it is toxic, H2O2also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses (Neill, 2002). To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled.Five potentialArabidopsisPOLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER (PUT) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters inLeishmania majorandTrympanosoma cruzi(Mulangiet al., 2012a,b). When expressed in the polyamine uptake-deficientΔagp2 Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutant (Aouidaet al., 2005), these proteins partially restored sensitivity to the polyamine analogue paraquat as well as to putrescine and spermidine. They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells (Mulangiet al., 2012a). PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast (Liet al., 2013).RMV1/PUT3has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake inArabidopsis(Fujitaet al., 2012). However, cadaverine transport by these proteins was not tested.Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. Cadaverine is produced by some soil bacteria and yeast, possibly contributing to rhizosphere–root signalling (Perriget al., 2007;Cloeteet al., 2009). Exogenous cadaverine affects root development in several ways: it increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans, and root weight in rice (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991;Niemiet al., 2002;Cassánet al., 2009), whereas it shortens primary roots in soybeans (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991).Cadaverine levels and localization change upon exposure to stress. This molecule accumulates dramatically upon oxidative stress in rape leaves and upon drought stress in peppers (Azizet al., 1997;Szidericset al., 2010). In the ice plant, salt stress causes cadaverine to accumulate in true leaves (Kuznetsovet al., 2007), and heat shock stimulates cadaverine transport away from the heated tissue (Shevyakovaet al., 2001). Cadaverine also confers protection against stress. It induces stomatal closure, a common stress response, in fava beans (Liuet al., 2000), and it prevents decreases in root and shoot weight upon oxidative stress in rice (Cassánet al., 2009).Despite its profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions, the underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverine alters plant growth and development are still unknown. To address this gap, natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine was examined, andORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1(OCT1,AT1G73220) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in this response."

Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll\na\n= 7.6 μgL\n-1\n, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll\na\n= 25.0 μgL\n-1\n, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L\n−1\n. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as\nOchromonas\nsp. and\nChlamydomonas\nsp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.\nKeywords:\nEcology toxicology; 2,4-D; Organic turbidity; Microbial communities; Freshwater ecosystems; Microcosms",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWith the advent of genetically modified crops and the introduction of no-till methods, herbicides have become the “stars” of the chemicals used in industrial agriculture. Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Amrhein et al., 1980), are used worldwide, while other herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control. Herbicides have several different modes of action (Peterson et al., 2015). Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants. It usually stimulates growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of action at low concentration (Grossmann, 2010). Auxin-derived herbicides such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916 tons worldwide between 1990-2002. The use of these herbicides was reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients between 2003-2014 (FAOSTAT, 2018). After more than 2 decades of glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds. The 2,4-D was the third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013 and 2015 (SENASA, 2018), and now it is considered one of the most used agrochemicals worldwide (Singh and Singh, 2016). Moreover, plants genetically modified to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were recently approved for commercial production in Argentina (CONABIA, 2019). Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to increase in Argentina.The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyledonous, ultimately leading to death (Song, 2014). After application, it is transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Singh and Singh, 2016). The persistence of 2,4-D in the environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312 days (Islam et al., 2018).Build-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and aquatic ecosystems. The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi (Bernat et al., 2018), insects (Sharma et al., 2018), amphibians (LaChapelle et al., 2007;Aronzon et al., 2011;Van Meter et al., 2018), fish (Dehnert et al., 2018;De Arcaute et al., 2018), and others (Islam et a. 2018). Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial communities (Kobraei and White, 1996;Aguayo et al., 2014;Lozano et al., 2018), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes. These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D), water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D (Lanctôt et al., 2014).The 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species, whereas high concentrations inhibit their development (Boyle, 1980;Kobraei and White, 1996;Wong, 2000). In regard to other freshwater communities,De Lipthay et al. (2003)reported that low concentrations of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L−1) modify the structure of the bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2,4-D degrading bacteria. In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth was detected at 20 mg L−1of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake (Aguayo et al., 2014), which resulted from the ability ofArthrobactersp. to use 2,4-D and other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy (Sandmann and Loos, 1988;Westerberg et al., 2000).It is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift (Ensminger et al., 2013;Aparicio et al., 2015;Berman et al., 2018;Metcalfe et al., 2019). Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be similarly affected by herbicides (Ferrari et al., 2018). Indeed, these organisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level (Vera et al., 2010,2012;Lipok et al., 2010;Pérez et al., 2011;Qiu et al., 2013;Pizarro et al., 2016). They are important in freshwater ecosystems because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-periphyton fraction). Taking into account the important ecosystem services supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glyphosate (Pérez et al., 2007).There are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina (Dukatz et al., 2006), which is one of the most affected regions by agricultural activities worldwide. These water bodies switch between two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies (Scheffer et al., 1993): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton. Both states show different phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and light conditions (Allende et al., 2009). In last decades, however, there are some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical contamination (Quirós et al., 2002;Vera et al., 2010).In this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial communities under different exposure conditions using microcosms. The assays were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages. One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other from a turbid freshwater system.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16.The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28.Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear.In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMost plants use gravitropism to guide the growth of their organs, directing primary roots vertically downward into the soil, primary shoots upward above ground, and secondary organs laterally, at an angle from the vertical named the gravity set point angle (GSA), to effectively explore their immediate surroundings. Overall, this process contributes to a plant’s ability to anchor itself into the soil, actively seek water and nutrients within its growth substrate, exchange gases, photosynthesize, and reproduce. Consequently, gravitropism is a key environmental response that allows plants to thrive under diverse environmental conditions, thereby contributing to plant fitness and productivity in their natural ecological niches as well as in agricultural settings.Gravitropism is composed of several successive phases that include gravity susception, believed to involve the sedimentation of heavy starch-filled plastids (amyloplasts, also named statoliths) in specialized cells (the statocytes) located in the starch sheath of shoots and in the columella cells of the root cap. This is followed by transduction into a biochemical signal through a process that remains largely unexplained, the formation of an auxin gradient across the gravistimulated organ, transmission of the gradient to the site of response, and differential cell elongation on opposite flanks of the organ, leading to a curvature response, usually upward for shoots and downward for roots (reviewed in [1]).The molecular mechanisms underlying the initial phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in the statocytes remain largely unknown. However, this process leads to a fast cytoplasmic alkalinization of the statocytes upon gravistimulation, accompanied by a change in polarity of the cell associated with the transcytotic relocalization of the auxin efflux facilitators PIN3 and PIN7 to the new bottom membrane [2,3,4,5]. This relocalization is dependent upon the proper functioning of key regulators in the statocytes, including ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1) and its paralog ARG1-like 2 (ARL2) [6,7], MODIFIER OFarg11 (MAR1/TOC75) and MAR2/TOC132 [8], LAZY, RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN (RLD) [9,10,11], and ADENOSINE KINASE 1 (ADK1) [12]. Additionally, mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis, such aspgm-1, affect gravitropism mostly by decreasing the density of statocyte amyloplasts, thereby affecting gravity susception [13]. Finally, PIN protein phosphorylation at conserved Ser residues has been shown to also modulate PIN3 relocalization in the statocytes and its auxin transport activity (reviewed in [14]).In roots, PIN3 and PIN7 relocalization in the upper layers of columella cells in the root cap upon plant reorientation within the gravity field allows the establishment of a lateral auxin gradient across the cap, which is transported through the lateral root cap and epidermal cells to the transition zone, where it promotes differential cellular elongation between the top and bottom flanks, leading to downward curvature. Rootward auxin transport in the peripheral tissues of the root is mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 auxin influx and efflux facilitators, respectively, as well as ABC transporters [15,16,17,18]. The PIN2 protein is localized in the plasma membrane mostly on the shootward side of the lateral cap and epidermal cells, dictating the shootward transport of auxin through cell files. Its recycling between the endosome and plasma membrane, and the regulation of its stability, are critical for its function in auxin transport and gravitropism [19]. Its abundance within the plasma membrane of transporting cells is enhanced by increased auxin levels and GOLVEN peptide signaling on the bottom flank, a process that reinforces the auxin gradient across the root tip as it moves toward the transition zone [19,20]. Furthermore, PIN2-mediated reflux of auxin from the peripheral tissues back into the vasculature stream toward the root tip also occurs at the transition zone, contributing significantly to the modulation of root gravitropism [21].The formation of an auxin gradient across the root tip and its transport to the transition zone and main segment of the elongation zone can be followed using live reporters. One of these reporters, namedDII-VENUS, encodes a protein that carries the cis-acting motifs needed for recognition by the SCFTIR1ubiquitin–ligase complex in the presence of auxin, leading to its degradation by the proteasome [22]. Hence, the cellular fluorescence signal generated by theDII-VENUSreporter rapidly decreases as a consequence of auxin-induced reporter degradation by the proteasome [22,23].A better understanding of the key molecular mechanisms that modulate gravity sensing and signal transduction in plants requires an accurate method to evaluate organ gravisensitivity, such that genotypes with altered gravisensitivity can be identified and further characterized. Early studies suggested that the curvature response of a plant organ to gravistimulation varies linearly as a function of the logarithm of the dose of gravistimulation, itself defined as the product of gravity intensity by time of stimulation (g.s) [24]. Quantifying tip angle for distinct doses of initial gravistimulation led to dose–response curves that fit logarithmic functions. Extension of the corresponding best-fit functions to the time axis under 1 g allowed the determination of thepresentation time, defined as the threshold stimulation time needed to produce curvature (reviewed in [25]). This method has been used extensively to estimate the gravisensitivity of plant organs despite ignoring the fact that very short periods of gravistimulation well below the presentation time can still induce gravicurvature when applied repeatedly. The threshold time of intermittent gravistimulation leading to gravicurvature (the perception time) is shorter than 1 s, suggesting the gravisensing machinery is exquisitely sensitive to reorientation [26,27,28].A re-evaluation of some of the data presented in previous presentation time studies revealed that a hyperbolic model better fits the observed data than the initially used logarithmic model [25]. Such hyperbolic models intersect the time axis at the origin, suggesting the slope of the best-fit hyperbolic model at the origin might provide a better representation of gravisensitivity than the presentation time [25]. Interestingly, a recent study using a centrifugation approach coupled with growth kinematics imaging provided support for a contribution oforgan inclination, rather than gravity intensity, in shoot gravity sensing [29].The presentation and perception times described above are much shorter than the time needed for initiation of the resulting curvature. This implies that the initial gravistimulation should be followed by a period without stimulation to allow the plant organ to develop curvature that is commensurate with the initial stimulus. The microgravity conditions encountered during spaceflight or at the International Space Station (ISS) are ideal for the implementation of such experiments [30,31,32]. Unfortunately, using either platform is very expensive and access to them is very limited. Furthermore, the use of centrifuges to create fractional gravity in space implies the creation of sharp gravity gradients between the center of the centrifuge and its periphery, which can have an unwanted impact on plant responses.To overcome these difficulties, researchers have used low-speed clinostats to mimic microgravity during the curving phase of the graviresponse. Indeed, these continuously rotating devices average the plant orientation relative to the gravity vector during each rotation cycle (reviewed in [33]). However, using this approach to define organ gravisensitivity is heavily reliant on the assumption that clinorotation does not have an impact of its own on root growth behavior. Unfortunately, published data may suggest otherwise.First, it is important to note that research teams have used clinostats to mimic microgravity in a variety of different ways, including rotating the plants at a range of angular velocities (from 0.33 to 60 RPM), with one rotation axis parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal growth axis of the plants (horizontal vs. vertical clinorotation, respectively), or rotating in space (three-dimensional clinostats or random positioning machines) (reviewed in [34]). A recent and careful investigation of the impact of various forms of clinorotation on plant organs growth revealed that slow horizontal clinorotation at 1 RPM induces stress responses in root statocytes and lower endodermal cells, whereas fast clinorotation in the range of 60 RPM leads to the directional root growth response to a force that results from both gravity and the centrifugal acceleration [34]. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the use of clinostats as microgravity mimics in experiments aimed at quantifying plant gravisensitivity.Considering that previous experiments aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of plant organs to gravistimulation used low-speed clinorotation to allow the development of a proportional curvature response to defined doses of gravistimulation applied before clinorotation, and given that presentation times of 0.4–5 min were previously reported forArabidopsis thalianaorgans using these methods [12,13,35,36], we set up an experiment to investigate whether low-speed clinorotation might itself trigger a directional root growth response without an initial dose of gravistimulation before clinorotation. Indeed, if seedlings are positioned vertically on a clinostat and rotation is initiated at a speed of 0.5 RPM, their organs will be exposed to a unidirectional gravistimulus over the first half-turn of clinorotation, which should last 60 s, before being exposed to a gravistimulus from the opposite direction. If the first half-turn of gravistimulation is sufficiently long enough to induce a persistent polarity in the statocytes, it should be sufficient to promote curvature at the end of clinorotation. In fact, our previous experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of clinorotation onArabidopsisroot skewing on hard agar surfaces uncovered the existence of clinostat-dependent root tip curvatures that were compatible with this “clinostat effect” [37].To better understand the effects exerted by low-speed clinorotation on root growth behavior and their connections with gravitropism, we exposedArabidopsis thaliana(a dicot model) andBrachypodium distachyon(a genetic model for monocot plants) seedlings, growing on agar-solidified medium, to low-speed clinorotation in the absence of a previous gravistimulus (defined as seedling reorientation away from the vertical), and analyzed their root tip responses to such clinorotation. We demonstrate the development of root tip curvature in both species at low speeds of clinorotation, and show that mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction interfere with this clinostat effect. We also show that low-speed clinorotation leading to root tip curvature promotes the relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the side membrane of the root cap statocytes and the development of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. We conclude that gravitropism contributes to the clinostat effect on root growth direction under low-speed clinorotation, and discuss the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of root gravisensitivity."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nControl of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis.

        "Title": "Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in mechanosensitive tissues",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic applications are also explored.\nKeywords:\nmechanotransduction, mechanosensation, cell membrane, mechanical loading, myocyte, muscle, osteocyte, bone, skeleton",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionEnvironmental adaptation is paramount to survival from the whole organism down to the cellular level, and a key component of this process is recognizing and responding to physical stimuli. Mechanotransduction is an evolutionarily conserved process that describes the conversion of mechanical stimuli into cellular signaling (1,2). This process informs how we perceive and respond to everyday life, from sensory information like touch, balance and proprioception, to cellular adaptation responses such as muscular hypertrophy, where mechanical loads initiate downstream signaling cascades that alter cellular behavior (3–6).Mechanosensation mechanisms, or the processes by which cells detect and recognize mechanical stimuli, remain an area of rigorous study in many fields. Cells concurrently utilize myriad mechanisms to recognize mechanical stimuli, such as stretch-gated ion channels, chemical or force-mediated conformational changes of the cytoskeleton, molecular transport through channel proteins like gap junctions, hemichannels, and pannexins, and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (7–20). Another such mechanosensation mechanism is the loading-induced development of small, transient discontinuities in the cell membrane called plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) (21). These PMD can be induced through several different mechanisms, including but not limited to exposure of the cell to physical deformation, debris, or fluid shear stress (12,22–25). Once formed, PMD initiate mechanotransduction signaling cascades similar to other known mechanosensation mechanisms (4,12,25–35). PMD facilitate the release of secondary messengers including ATP, nitric oxide (NO), and various growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factors) (34,36,37). Mechanotransduction can also be induced by transmission of signals from PMD-affected cells to nearby, non-wounded neighboring populations, providing a mechanism by which signaling from a small population of wounded cells may be amplified. For example, in MDCK kidney epithelial cells, PMD induced a paracrine purinergic signaling event that increased cyclic AMP synthesis in neighboring cells (34,35). Following PMD, neighboring cells displayed an initial decrease in cAMP, before experiencing a transient ATP-dependent increase in cAMP. In wounded cells, cAMP activity increases membrane repair rate, in anticipation of repetitive disruptions (38). The increased cAMP signaling in neighboring cells has been hypothesized to play a protective role in response to PMD events in nearby cells by preparing for their own PMD events to subsequently occur.Resealing of PMD is necessary for cell survival, as without resealing, the cell is vulnerable to an unregulated influx of cytosolic toxins (such as calcium and oxidants) while simultaneously allowing ATP and proteins to escape (4,25,27,28,32,34–36,39–50). PMD repair (which will be discussed in the next section) therefore represents a fundamental, biological response to cell injury (4,6,12,29,30,33,51,52). Mechanosensitive cell populations utilize PMD-initiated signaling cascades to coordinate inflammatory mediators, release of secondary messengers, and recruitment of repair machinery to the site of the disruption and to initiate subsequent downstream signaling events. Calpains, annexins, growth factors, and NO have all been reported to play roles in signaling downstream of PMD in multiple types of mechanosensitive tissues (12,25,34–36,48,53–55).PMD have been detected in skin, alveolar, kidney, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocyte fibroblasts and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal myocytes, neurons, and most recently in the periodontal ligament cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes of the skeletal system (4,12,25,30,31,33,35,52,56) (Figure 1). A common feature of these cell types is that they are regularly exposed to varying magnitudes of shear stress (9,57–62). For example, epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract are affected by gut motility, which subjects the tract to compressive and shear stresses (29). Likewise, aortic endothelial cells are exposed to shear stress as blood circulates through the body (33,63), and osteocytes are exposed to fluid shear within the lacunocanalicular system (64,65). This review will address the similarities and differences between PMD in mechanosensitive tissues, with a focus on bone, comparing repair mechanisms, downstream signaling pathways, and the implications of these properties for disease states.Figure 1.Open in a new tabTissues and cell types in which plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) have been observed.

Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (Simmons et al., 1983;Ghosh et al., 2016;Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), teeth (Rosenberg et al., 1984;Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), salivary glands (Groza et al., 1981,1983;Mednieks and Hand, 1985,1987;Mednieks et al., 2014,2015;Dagdeviren et al., 2018a) and saliva (Brown et al., 1977), are significantly affected by spaceflight.The response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (Mednieks et al., 2014,2015). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a).The aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, salivary gland structure, protein expression, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction:\nSpace is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems.

Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice.

        "Introduction": "1 IntroductionThe transition from 1gto the space environment changes not only gravity but also various other conditions such as the circadian rhythm (Otsuka et al., 2018) and exposure to cosmic rays (Zeitlin et al., 2013). It is important to elucidate the medical risks that humans face when living in a space environment, such as the oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (Overbey et al., 2019) and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (Dadwal et al., 2019). Artificial imitation of these environments may provide an understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to avoid space stress.A previous study showed that the gravitational threshold in the space environment provides a platform for exploring the mechanisms controlling the skeletal muscle response to alterations in gravity (Hayashi et al., 2023). Elucidation of the functional changes and molecular mechanisms involved may lead to the development of strategies to maintain human health during future long-term space travel. The musculoskeletal system and muscle movement controlled by somatic nerves have been studied previously in space and artificial gravitational environments (Juhl et al., 2021;Hayashi et al., 2023). Although studies on the heart rate and activity rhythms controlled by the autonomic nervous system in space are addressed (Blaber et al., 2004;Liu et al., 2015), research on the salivary glands, which are representative of local fluid balance regulation by the system, are limited. Saliva maintains the moist environment of oral tissues and is essential not only for feeding, mastication, and swallowing food but also for oral functions such as digestion, and articulation. In addition, saliva has antibacterial properties that help control the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, contributing to oral hygiene and prevention of dental issues such as cavities and gum disease. Saliva helps maintain pH balance in the mouth and neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria, thereby reducing the risk of tooth decay and erosion. It plays a role in taste perception by dissolving food particles and allowing them to interact with the taste buds in the tongue. Therefore, saliva is a multifunctional fluid that contributes significantly to oral and digestive health. Insufficient saliva production, known as dry mouth or xerostomia, can lead to various oral health problems and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of salivary secretion during spaceflights.In this study, we collected submandibular glands from mice exposed to artificial lunar gravity.Among the major salivary glands, the large amount of saliva secretion comes from the submandibular gland. Therefore, we thought that changes in salivary gland mRNA due to environmental changes might be more clearly observed in the submandibular gland compared to other salivary glands. In addition, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and we considered that it would be a good model to observe the control mechanism and balance of protein secretion and water secretion by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, i.e., under autonomic regulation.Artificial lunar gravity was developed using multiple artificial gravity research systems (MARS) that use a centrifuge to create artificial gravity, enabling comparative studies between the effects of gravity and microgravity in space (Shimbo et al., 2016;Shiba et al., 2017;Okada et al., 2021). This system has contributed to analysis of sulfur metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in the liver (Kurosawa et al., 2021), metabolic effects in adipose tissues (Suzuki et al., 2020;Uruno et al., 2021), blood parameters changes (Shimizu et al., 2023), bone mineralization, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism in mouse kidneys (Suzuki et al., 2022) during space travel. This study investigated the basic foundations for oral clinical medicine under lunar gravity. We sought to understand whether lunar gravity (1/6g) influence the mRNA expression in salivary glands during space flight. Using the developed MARS, two independent missions (MHU-4 and MHU-5) were conducted in the space. Using the MARS system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the whole submandibular gland tissue of mice raised under lunar (1/6g) and Earth gravity (1g)."

        "Title": "Reactivation of Latent Epstein-Barr Virus: A Comparison after Exposure to Gamma, Proton, Carbon, and Iron Radiation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAmong the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1)\n137\nCs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.\nKeywords:\nspace radiation, Epstein‒Barr virus, virus reactivation",
        "Introduction": "1. Introduction1.1. Stressors in a Space EnvironmentIn the space environment, astronauts are exposed to multiple stressors such as isolation, confinement, variable gravitational forces, increased radiation, psychosocial stressors, sleep deprivation, noise, physical exertion, deconditioning, and anxiety [1]. Among these stressors, the radiation environment in low-Earth orbit is composed of a complex mixture of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), particles of trapped belts, and secondary particles generated in both the spacecraft and Earth’s atmosphere [2]. Ions of all atomic numbers from hydrogen to uranium are present in GCR, the great majority being protons. Their energies cover a large spectrum extending from a few MeV/n to nearly 1015MeV/n, peaking at ~1 GeV/n. On Earth, heavy ions are shielded by the Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere. In space, many highly charged (Z) and energy (HZE) particles, such as iron ions, are difficult to shield with existing methods. Furthermore, they may collide with nuclei of the atoms they encounter, fragmenting either the target and/or the projectile thereby producing several secondary particles. Therefore, space radiation is a concern for long-duration space missions, such as the three-year Mars mission that would lead to a whole-body dose of about 1 Sievert or more [3].1.2. Reactivation of Latent VirusesImmune system dysregulation, defined by altered leukocyte distribution, reduced T and NK cell function, and altered plasma cytokine levels, has been reported in astronauts during short- and long-duration spaceflight [4,5]. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses results as a consequence of decreased immunity in astronauts [6,7,8,9]. A central question is whether the detection of increased levels of viruses in humans during spaceflight is due to immunosuppression associated with travel in space or a direct effect of space environmental factors, such as radiation inducing reactivation of the virus from latency. For example, the primary infection by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. When cellular immunity to VZV wanes with age and/or immunosuppression, VZV can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles). The consequences of latent viral reactivation are important as shingles may be complicated by post-herpetic neuralgia, zoster paresis, cranial nerve palsies, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, vasculopathy, or ocular disorders [10]. Similarly, reactivation of Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) may lead to lymphoproliferative disease and may play a role in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, peripheral B and T cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [11].We have studied the effects of four types of radiation,137Cs gamma, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions on the reactivation of EBV in an EBV-producer line (Akata) in vitro. This cell line was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma [12]. There are several reasons for the choice of radiation types. The137Cs gamma ray is a common source of photons, which are often used in experiments as a reference for low linear energy transfer (LET). Protons are an obvious choice as they are the most important component of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra. The 150-MeV protons have a low LET and are considered to have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 for several biological end points [13]. The RBE value of 1.1 for protons is based mostly on cell colony formation data, generally at higher, therapy-type dosages. Although it does not necessarily apply to other biological end points, it is an indication that protons and photons have similar biological effects at the same dose. The carbon ions are present in GCR and are also considered for hadron therapy. The iron ions are a relatively rare occurrence in the GCR, but they have high LET and high RBE for several biological end points [13]. Therefore, by using these ions, which cover a large part of the GCR spectra, the biological effects of representative particle types in space can be determined.In this study, we found that a significant increase in EBV reactivation relative to controls is observed for all radiation types used. However, when equal doses (physical doses not corrected for the RBE) are compared with control, each radiation source induced viral reactivation differently. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation. These findings challenge the common RBE concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points [13]. This difference in viral reactivation may be explained by the differences in the radiation track structure."

In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.\nResults\nStreptococcus\nwas the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe World Health Organization published a surveillance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide, non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of global disease burden and was expected to be responsible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all deaths by 2020s [1]. In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [2]. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [3,4], asthma [5], diabetes [6], cardiovascular disease [7], colorectal cancer [8], and breast cancer [9] have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [10], colitis [11], or colorectal cancer [12] then go on to develop disease.The importance of the human microbiome in health promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been 557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer space with well-documented physiological and immunological issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive immunity [13–15]. However, data is still limited on how the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the conditions experienced by many astronauts.Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions suggest that oral microbial populations may change during spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [16]. The effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21], and thus could significantly impact the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to Mars).Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been documented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both short (10–16 days) [22] and long (60–180 days) [23] duration ISS missions with longer missions producing higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter duration]) [23]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [24,25]. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome [26–29].The aim of this study was to examine, for the first time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a microbiome signature that may be influential in preventing or promoting viral reactivation in humans. The data acquired from this study could help inform the NASA medical team about the role of bacterial signatures in maintaining crew health while in space."

        "Title": "The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGC14 regulates root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H\n+\n-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the\nArabidopsis thaliana\nroot surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H\n+\n-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.\nResearch organism:\nA. thaliana",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-motile, mechanically coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direction of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, thanks to its long-distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007;Wisniewska et al., 2006).The root apex is divided in several zones fulfilling various roles in root development. At the tip of the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the meristem, stem cells produce transit-amplifying cells that populate the root tip (Dolan et al., 1993;Campilho et al., 2006). In the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the transition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors (Verbelen et al., 2006). Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root tip through the soil (Beemster and Baskin, 1998). After reaching their final length, cells differentiate in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root surface.To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both (Lintilhac, 2014). Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ATPases is crucial for both cell wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, and the H+gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required for turgor pressure generation (Falhof et al., 2016). It is therefore not surprising that root zones of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH (Siao et al., 2020). In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+fluxes (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). Several studies showed that this battery-like system, with positive charges flowing out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+fluxes without completely excluding calcium and chloride ions (Weisenseel et al., 1979;Björkman and Leopold, 1987;Behrens et al., 1982;Iwabuchi et al., 1989). Similar pattern of H+fluxes was determined inA. thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the border between meristematic and transition zones (Staal et al., 2011). Other works have attempted to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the maturation zone of the root (Barbez et al., 2017;Moreau et al., 2022;Großeholz et al., 2022). It is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane potential (Stanković, 2006). In general, the relationship between H+fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+fluxes are observed in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and its physiological significance remain unclear.The apoplastic pH is largely controlled by the activity of the proton pump H+ATPases, encoded by 11 genes in theA. thalianagenome; in roots, the dominant paralogs are AHA1 and AHA2 (Haruta et al., 2010). While their activity is mainly regulated by phosphorylation (Falhof et al., 2016), the expression and membrane localization of AHAs along the longitudinal root axis seems to be important for the zonation of theA. thalianaroot.Haruta et al., 2018, showed that under conditions of dim light, the AHA2-mCitrine was less abundant in the membranes of transition zone cells, and this partially correlated with higher surface pH of the transition zone cells. Under conditions of light, the AHA2-mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone.Pacifici et al., 2018, presented a model where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relocalization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally,Großeholz et al., 2022, quantified the AHA2-GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-GFP membrane abundance toward the maturation zone ofA. thalianaroot, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface. Still, the observed patterns of proton fluxes along the root zones (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997), and in particular the existence of the alkaline domain around the transition zone of the root, cannot be simply explained by the expression or abundance of AHA proton pumps.Roots use the gravity vector as the reference for the direction of their growth. A general pattern was shown in various plant species: during the gravitropic response, ion fluxes change rapidly, leading to increased proton secretion on the upper and decreased secretion on the lower side, where it correlates with growth inhibition, and results in bending of the root (Mulkey and Evans, 1981;Behrens et al., 1982;Iwabuchi et al., 1989;Collings et al., 1992;Weisenseel et al., 1992). InA. thaliana, the root surface and cell wall alkalinization of lower side upon gravistimulation has also been clearly demonstrated (Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015;Barbez et al., 2017), and it was shown that this alkalinization requires functional auxin transport (Monshausen et al., 2011) and the CNGC14 calcium channel acting downstream of auxin signaling (Shih et al., 2015). Alkalinization of the lower root side is thus triggered by the redirection of auxin flux toward the lateral root cap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the root (Brunoud et al., 2012). Analogously, apoplast alkalinization can be triggered by the application of auxin to the roots (Evans et al., 1980;Lüthen and Böttger, 1988;Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015;Barbez et al., 2017). The root surface pH increases almost immediately upon auxin application, and this process requires the activity of the CNGC14 calcium channel; in the mutant, surface alkalinization as well as the auxin-induced growth inhibition are delayed (Shih et al., 2015). The rapid root growth inhibition as well as the membrane depolarization and surface alkalinization triggered by auxin depend on the rapid branch of the TIR1/AFB signaling branch; auxin influx by AUX1 and the AFB1 auxin co-receptor paralogue play a prominent role in the rapid auxin response (Fendrych et al., 2018;Dindas et al., 2018;Prigge et al., 2020;Serre et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021;Dubey et al., 2021). The molecular mechanism of surface alkalinization is, however, not understood. It was proposed that auxin plays a dual role in regulation of root apoplastic pH: auxin alkalinizes the apoplast by the activity of an unknown ion channel downstream of the TIR1/AFB signaling, and, at the same time, auxin upregulates the activity of AHA H+ATPases through TMK1 signaling (Li et al., 2021). It is not clear how auxin activates the TMK kinases. On the other hand, the connection between TIR1/AFB auxin signaling and activity of AHAs has been clarified: the auxin-induced SAUR proteins inhibit the PP2C-D clade of protein phosphatases that act as negative regulators of AHAs, leading to the activation of proton secretion. This pathway was studied mainly in shoots, but seems also to operate in roots, as theArabidopsislines with manipulated SAUR or PP2C-D expression show root phenotypes that are consistent with the expected changes in AHA activities (Spartz et al., 2014;Ren et al., 2018). In summary, the connection between auxin signaling, regulation of the activity of AHA H+ATPases, and the longitudinal zonation of the root surface pH profile during normal growth and during gravitropic responses remains unclear.Here, by employing an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, we focus on the molecular actors involved in the establishment of the longitudinal surface pH zonation. In particular, we show that the alkaline domain around the transition zone is not caused by the lack of AHA H+ATPases activity. Further, we demonstrate that the alkaline domain at the transition zone is controlled by the components of the rapid auxin response pathway. Finally, we address the significance of the dynamic surface pH profile for the gravitropic response of the roots."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMuscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration.",

        "Title": "Impacts of radiation exposure, hindlimb unloading, and recovery on murine skeletal muscle cell telomere length.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAstronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.\nSubject terms:\nStem cells, Cell biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in microgravity1. A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%2. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated3–5. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity6.Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also called satellite cells, are necessary for muscle formation in embryogenesis and for muscle growth during childhood and adolescence7,8. In healthy adults, MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage9. In the context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate specific signaling pathways in skeletal muscles related to inflammation, protein synthesis, and autophagy10. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and differentiation capacities11,12. In terms of effects of radiation exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inflammatory signaling13. Studies using chronic, lower dose, whole-body irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little effect on differentiative capacity14. Higher dose leg-specific radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myofiber sizes and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well15, suggesting that level and duration of exposure could have different effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors.The length of telomeres is an important parameter of tissue proliferative potential16. Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as cellular proliferation clocks17. Telomere attrition leads to loss of cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy18,19. Shortened telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ compartments, including brain20, spleen, small intestine, and reproductive system, among others21. Additionally, it has been reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human fibroblasts appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response following X-ray irradiation22. Increased DNA damage found at telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper cellular functionality23,24.Recently, the effects of spaceflight have been meticulously investigated in the NASA Twins Study, where effects of preflight, inflight, and postflight conditions on a monozygotic twin were measured by multiple metrics and compared with the grounded twin brother25. That study revealed telomere lengthening in T cells of the inflight astronaut, which rapidly shortened postflight25. Another study investigating different astronaut flight conditions found similar results26. However, despite the importance of maintaining skeletal muscles during spaceflight, telomere length metrics in astronaut muscles have not been assessed.The goal of this study was to measure telomere length in resident skeletal muscle cells of grounded, wild-type mice experiencing spaceflight-like conditions, using a whole-body irradiation (IR) and hindlimb suspension (HLS)/mechanical unloading approach. We found that a combination of IR and HLS resulted in telomere elongation, specifically in myogenic cell populations, which did not recover upon a short duration reloading of hindlimbs."

The hormone abscisic acid (\nABA\n) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure\nthrough synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (\nROS\n).\nROS\naccumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations\nfrom reaching damaging levels within the cell.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAngiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in\nPopulus\ntrees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, and gibberellic acid (\nGA\n) stimulation of tension wood formation are all sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription factor-encoding gene\nARBORKNOX2\n(\nARK2\n). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation,\nGA\ntreatment, and modulation of\nARK2\nexpression.

We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem triggers opposite wood formation.",

        "Title": "Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTo sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.\nKeywords:\nplasma membrane protein enrichment, exocytosis, proteomics, small molecule inhibitors, exocyst",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses. Plasma membrane proteins can be classified as integral, lipid-anchored, and peripheral, based on the mode of association with the plasma membrane (Stillwell, 2016). Integral membrane proteins possess one to several transmembrane domains; lipid-anchored proteins associate with the plasma membrane through covalently attached fatty acids; peripheral membrane proteins associate with the plasma membrane through interactions with other membrane proteins, polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, or both. Several well-characterized plasma membrane-localized nutrient transporters, hormone receptors and transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are known to undergo constitutive delivery and turnover (Li et al., 2002;Friml, 2010;Takano et al., 2010;Kleine-Vehn et al., 2011;Irani et al., 2012;Bashline et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2018;Vellosillo et al., 2021). Proteomic analyses of plasma membrane proteins reveal that the composition is altered in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007;Nouri and Komatsu, 2010;Elmore et al., 2012;Takahashi et al., 2013;Nie et al., 2015;Cao et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2016;Voothuluru et al., 2016); however, the mechanisms for delivery of most of these plasma membrane proteins are not well characterized. Investigating how plants maintain the variety, abundance, and dynamics of plasma membrane proteins is essential for understanding cell growth, development, and response to stresses.The conventional plant secretory pathway involves trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles to deliver lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane or extracellular space (Denecke et al., 2012;Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013;Zhu et al., 2020;Aniento et al., 2022). The exocyst complex is a conserved octameric protein complex that primarily functions to mediate the tethering of secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during the last step of exocytic trafficking (Elias et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2010;Žárský et al., 2013;Wu and Guo, 2015;Synek et al., 2021;Žárský, 2022). In addition, the exocyst complex also associates with the endocytic and autophagy machinery to modulate membrane recycling and autophagy (Prigent et al., 2003;Kulich et al., 2013;Žárský et al., 2013;Ortega et al., 2022;Žárský, 2022). One plant exocyst subunit, EXO70A1, was recently characterized as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, through its interactions with anionic phospholipids (Synek et al., 2021). Loss of EXO70A1 function disrupts the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells (Synek et al., 2021). Some known cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex-mediated trafficking include PIN auxin transporters (Drdová et al., 2013), brassinosteroid receptor (Zhang et al., 2016), and cellulose synthase complexes (Zhu et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2021). However, it is not known what other plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane through the exocyst complex. Whereas the half-life for turnover of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells varies from a few hours to a few days (Tweto and Doyle, 1976;Doyle and Baumann, 1979;Chu and Doyle, 1985), we know much less about the mechanisms and dynamics of protein delivery to the plasma membrane in plants.Previously, the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) was shown to target the EXO70A1 subunit of Arabidopsis exocyst complex and to inhibit exocytosis in plant and mammalian cells (Zhang et al., 2016;Huang et al., 2019). Short-term ES2 treatment inhibits the transport of PIN-FORMED (PIN) family auxin transporter, PIN2, and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, to the plasma membrane (Zhang et al., 2016), and also impairs the recycling of PIN2 (Lešková et al., 2020). In mammalian cells, ES2 treatment reduces the cell surface abundance of a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT2-MMP (Gómez-Escudero et al., 2017). In addition, given the role of the exocyst complex in autophagy, a recent study examined the consequences of ES2 treatment in autophagy events in mammalian cells, and found that a 24-h ES2 treatment resulted in decreased autophagy (Ortega et al., 2022). To characterize changes in plasma membrane protein composition after short-term inhibition of the exocyst complex, and to identify additional proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex, we used ES2 to inhibit the exocyst complex. We enriched plasma membrane from roots of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with ES2 and DMSO solvent control and identified proteins using mass spectrometry analysis. We then performed quantitative and comparative proteomic analyses to identify plasma membrane proteins with altered abundance in ES2-treated samples and considered proteins with reduced abundance as candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking in plants. We identified a subset of proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after two hours of 40 μM ES2 treatment. Gene Ontology analysis of proteins with reduced abundance demonstrated enrichment for functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, membrane transport, hormone signaling, and stress responses. The abundance of many protein kinases and several uncharacterized proteins was reduced by ES2 treatment as well. Our results show that the exocyst complex mediates dynamic transport of a diverse set of proteins essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAuxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of\nArabidopsis thaliana SCD1\n(\nstomatal cytokinesis defective1\n) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the\nscd1-1\nmutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In\nscd1-1\nat 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in\nscd1-1\nexhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.\nKeywords:\nSCD1, gravitropism, lateral root, auxin transport, PIN2,\nArabidopsis thaliana",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients (Muday and DeLong, 2001;Vieten et al., 2007;Zazimalova et al., 2010). Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) is transported long distances in two polarities in two root cell layers (Muday and DeLong, 2001). Cell to cell IAA transport is mediated by AUX/LAX influx carriers and by efflux carriers of the PIN and ABCB families (Zazimalova et al., 2010). Directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane (Wisniewska et al., 2006;Adamowski and Friml, 2015). InArabidopsisroots, PIN1 is localized to the stele and implicated in auxin transport toward the root apex (Galweiler et al., 1998), which is now called rootward transport and this auxin flow is required for lateral root development (Reed et al., 1998;Lavenus et al., 2013). In contrast, PIN2 is localized to the epidermal and cortical cell layers of roots and mediates shootward transport from the root apex (Muller et al., 1998), which is integral to root elongation and gravitropism (Rashotte et al., 2000). PIN3 is localized to the columella cells at the root tip, where the angle of the gravity vector is perceived, and in the vascular cylinder, consistent with functions in gravitropism and root development, respectively (Friml et al., 2002;Harrison and Masson, 2007).The polar distribution of the PIN proteins is dynamic (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014;Weller et al., 2017). Targeting of PIN proteins to the membrane in response to stimuli may be an important mechanism to allow changes in auxin transport and dependent growth processes (Paciorek et al., 2005;Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). PIN proteins travel through the endosome to the plasma membrane afterde novosynthesis through a highly regulated process (Jasik et al., 2013,2016) involving the RAB and ARF families of small G proteins. GNOM, a well-studied ARF-GEF and target of the drug Brefeldin A, is critical in targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane (Geldner et al., 2001,2004,2003). Although genetic approaches have identified pathways for targeting PIN proteins (Adamowski and Friml, 2015), non-conditional mutants with impaired auxin transport, such asgnom, have profound developmental phenotypes (Geldner et al., 2003). This complicates determination of whether altered auxin transport causes developmental phenotypes or the converse.This study used a conditionalscd1-1mutant to test whether auxin transport trafficking defects precede growth or developmental phenotypes. The SCD1 protein has a DENN domain, found exclusively in RAB-GEFs (Yoshimura et al., 2010;Marat et al., 2011). SCD1 and an associated protein, SCD2, have been shown to complex with a RabE1 at the exocyst inArabidopsisroots (Mayers et al., 2017), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. Threescd1mutant alleles have been described:scd1-1,scd1-2, andscd1-3(Falbel et al., 2003).scd1-2andscd1-3are loss of function mutants with altered guard cell development, and profound root growth and developmental phenotypes. However, the temperature sensitivescd1-1allele, displays these phenotypes only at the restrictive temperature of 25°C (Falbel et al., 2003).This study utilizes the unique features of a temperature sensitivescd1-1mutant allele to demonstrate that the growth and developmental effects inArabidopsisroots at the restrictive temperature are tied to altered auxin transport protein targeting. The developmental and auxin transport defects can be induced by transition to the restrictive temperature and reversed by return to the permissive temperature. We report the effects of these treatments on polar auxin transport and dependent physiological processes including lateral root development, gravity response, and root elongation. At the restrictive temperature, PIN2 fused to GFP accumulates in endomembrane vesicles inscd1-1, which is consistent with a role of SCD1 in controlling PIN endomembrane targeting. Auxin transport and endomembrane accumulation of a PIN2 reporter were examined both inscd1-1grown continuously at the restrictive temperature or in seedlings transitioned briefly to this temperature. The endomembrane bodies in which the PIN2 fusion protein is localized also accumulate other proteins that are linked to the late multivesicular endosome and the endosome dye FM4-64 after an extended incubation. These results provide support for the hypothesis that SCD1 protein functions to regulate the movement of PIN2 to and from the plasma membrane and that these transient changes in localization occur more rapidly than changes in auxin transport and dependent developmental processes."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs of November 21st, 2021, over 257 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported, and more than 5 million lives claimed globally [1]. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provide a major step forward in reducing COVID-19’s impact. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and the continued viral transmission allows for accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, which can provide advantages in replication, immune escape, increased transmissibility, or diagnostic detection failure [2]. With the quickly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and the slow rate of vaccination globally, it is critical to fully understand this novel virus and disease.Coronaviruses are named as such because the S proteins resemble a halo or corona on scanning electron microscope imagery [3]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus. Of the human Betacoronavirus, including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. SARS-CoV-2 bears the highest genetic sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1 [5]. Accordingly, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, resembles SARS, caused by SARS-CoV-1, in many ways, but with some important differences [6]. Key characteristics of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 include: 1) a positive-sense RNA virus with a large genome of ~30 kilobases; 2) a large, enveloped virus containing a helical nucleocapsid with the virus’s genetic code, with an exterior studded in several spike proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells), and 3) similar genomic structures. The first 2/3 of both genomes encodes for two macro polypeptides pp1a/pp1b (see Fig.1). Pp1a/pp1b are auto-proteolytically processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins (NSP).Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 structure.Open in a new tabStructural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above). SARS-CoV-2 genome components (below).The main virus-specific functions of the SARS-CoV-2 NSPs are: NSP1 - cellular mRNA degradation, global translation inhibition; NSP2 - cell cycle progression disruption; NSP3 - formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs; SARS-CoV-2 protease); NSP4 - formation of DMVs; NSP5 - main SARS-CoV-2 protease; NSP6 - formation of DMVs, NSP7 - replication complex; NSP8 – primase; NSP9 - RNA binding protein; NSP10 - cofactor of NSP14 & NSP16; NSP11 - unknown, NSP12 - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; NSP13 - RNA helicase, 5ʹ phosphatase, NSP14 - N7-MTase, 3ʹ-5ʹ exonuclease; NSP15 – endonuclease; and NSP16–2ʹ-O-MTase, mRNA capping.The remaining 1/3 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid), and several open reading frames (ORFs; (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and 10) [7]. The S protein binds the host cell receptor, which for SARS-CoV-1/2 is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (see Fig.2and Supplementary Table1). These proteins share homology and function with SARS-CoV-1.Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 binding, intracellular internalization, and intracellular processes.Open in a new tabStructural interactions between the virus and target cell, including the viral spike protein, ACE2-receptor, TMPRSS2 reaction to cleave and begin the viral intracellular internalization (above,A), and consequent signal transduction pathways stimulated by the virus as it hijacks pathways to turn the infected cell into a SARS-CoV-2 producing factory (below,B).There are two notable differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. First is the presence of the ORF8 polypeptide found in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-1 has a 29 nucleotide (nt) deletion (del) which splits it into ORF8a and ORF8b. Second, SARS-CoV-2 contains a gene encoding a novel orphan protein, ORF10, which is not present in SARS-CoV-1 [7].SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary rate has been estimated to be around 9’×’10−4substitutions per site per year [8], while also having a high transmissibility, large portion of asymptomatic cases [9], large pool of susceptible hosts to replicate in [10,11], and on-going environmental pressures (e.g., low vaccination rates and changes in policies allowing human carriers to continue to transmit the virus), which have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to accumulate mutation in its genome.Mutations have been detected in all parts of the viral genome, including in the leader 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR), orf1ab (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP6, NSP12, NSP13, and NSP14), spike, ORF3a, ORF8, nucleocapsid, and ORF10 [8]. These genomic changes have been shown to influence viral immune evasion, inflammasome interaction, helicase, exonuclease proofreading mechanism, the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and thereby viral replication, infectivity, and cell release [12].Mutations associated with the spike are of particular interest, as they influence human-to-human transmission, as well as human-to-animal passage. Within the spike, mutations tend to fall into four general classes, those that affect the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which are of importance because some may provide both immune escape or a fitness advantage, as well as facilitate reverse zoonotic events. There are some mutations that occur in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is the portion most exposed on the virus surface. There is evidence for immune selection in this region, and preliminary evidence that at least one of these changes (delH69/delV70) could improve fitness [13]. Mutations in or near the furin cleavage site, and several groupings close to the D614G mutation, possibly affect infection efficiency and can also be important for neutralizing antibodies.This large SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity has been categorized by different nomenclature systems, describing variants of varied public health interest or concern. Pango lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have been classified as “variants of concern” (VOC) because they present mutations that have been shown to impact diagnostics, treatments, or vaccines, conferring increased transmissibility and increased disease severity. The impact of these mutations highlights the need for further research not only on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 intracellular processes, but also how the extracellular environment may lead to further spread of the virus and subsequent public health burden.The SARS-CoV-2 virus can exert physiological effects by directly infecting cells and via intercellular signaling by the infected cells. In this review, we provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection and intracellular host responses (targets, pathways, networks, biological processes, and functional adaptations) to viral invasion. We emphasize a canonical set of reactions induced by SARS-CoV-2, which we have organized for the reader’s consideration. However, there is tremendous variation in cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, depending on factors including the cell type, organ type, metabolic and physiological context, patient genetics, individual clinical characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities), and stage/severity in the COVID-19 disease.This is the first of a three-part comprehensive series of linked reviews on SARS-CoV-2 covering: intracellular effects (present study); extracellular consequences (review 2); and current and potential therapeutics (review 3). This review and the two that will follow aim to provide a foundational understanding of the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, from basic biology to clinical outcome and therapy avenues, that highlight future areas of research and could help inform public health interventions across the world.Infected tissue and cell typesSARS-CoV-2 targets the nasal cavity and lungs; however, the detailed cellular tropism remains unclear, and likely varies among individuals. Furthermore, there is increased variability of viral cellular tropism with the emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, 1.617.3, Mu, Zeta, and in particular, Delta and Omicron, as well as the various lineages of each variant [14]. This is related with SARS-CoV-2’s mutation ability affecting its antigenic phenotype to circumvent immunity. The spike protein mediates attachment of the virus to host cell-surface receptors and fusion between virus and cell membranes; it is also the principal target for neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and is the component for both mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines [15]. Several studies have contributed to the current understanding of how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affect neutralization and emergence of new strains, which include studies of traditional escape mutation, targeted characterization of particular mutations, and wider investigations of large numbers of circulating variants [16]. These are active areas of research, in particular given the continued emergence of new lineages of new variants. A study of human, bat, non-human primate, and mouse cell lines showed various cell types were susceptible to the virus. These included pulmonary, intestinal, hepatic, renal, and neuronal, with cell lines expressing the hACE-2 receptor (hACE-2) having a generally greater viral load [17]. Although cell lines do not reflect physiological conditions, this research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect many cell types, and that hACE-2 provides a critical entry mechanism [18]. Epithelial, vascular endothelial, pancreas, and mucosal cell types can all be infected by the virus [19–21].Several investigations have employed 3D organoid cultures to simulate more physiological conditions than cell cultures [22]. In one such study, lung and colonic organoid models showed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reduced when various SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors were applied [22]. Another study illustrated the flexibility of different organoid models, such as pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells, and adult primary cells (human islets, hepatocyte, and cholangiocytes) to test viral effects such as cytokine production, gene expression, and other physiological responses. The resultant data correlated well with some patient autopsy samples [22] indicating organoids provide a valuable disease modeling tool [18].In one study of post-mortem patients, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed viral antigen (spike protein) in pneumocytes and hyperplastic cells around the bronchioles, mucosal epithelia, submucosal glands, gland ducts of the trachea, glands of the small intestine, distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, islets of Langerhans, glands and intra-islet ducts of the pancreas, and vascular tissues of the brain and heart [23]. Few viral antigens were present in the large intestine and renal proximal tubules, and none in the liver. A follow-up colocalization analysis showed ACE2 and viral antigen in the lung, trachea, small intestine, kidney, pancreas, and heart. In the brain, ACE2-expressing cells were detected, but they were negative for the viral antigen [23]. Endothelial cells of multiple organs were infected, supporting the clinical observations of endotheliitis in some COVID-19 patients.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated ACE2 receptor expression was primarily restricted to lung pneumocytes, gut absorptive enterocytes, and nasal mucosa goblet secretory cells [24]. In general, the distribution of ACE2 receptors may in part explain the systemic diversity and range of SARS-CoV-2’s effects. Further research into infection of these cell types versus others in mucosal barrier organs will be important to determine cell-types that serve as initial entry ways for the virus into the body.Human autopsy studies [21] have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including lungs, pharynx, liver, nasal mucosa, trachea, intestines, skin, pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart. A study of 27 patients showed multi-organ tropisms (lung, pharynx, heart, liver, brain, and kidneys), with the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 copies per cell, as detected by in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, in the respiratory tract, and lower levels in the kidneys, liver, heart, and brain [21]. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs, patient autopsy, and body-wide tissues (e.g. heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes), provided further evidence of the physiologically systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 [24].These studies suggest that the virus has a varying range of expression within each organ, which may be influenced by levels of the ACE2-receptor and related entry factors (Transmembrane protease, serine-2 [TMPRSS2], transferrin receptor protein 1 [TRFC1], cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], and neuropilin-1 [NRP1]) within each organ-type [24]. This further highlights the varied organ and tissues that are capable of being infected by the virus, and the resultant wide-range of patient symptoms.The physiological status of the individual significantly affects COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [25,26]. Notably, patients with pre-existing conditions of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have a less favorable disease outcome, likely in part due to the elevated levels of inflammation and metabolic disturbances associated with those conditions [25]. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate pre-existing conditions, leading to more severe COVID-19 outcome [27].SARS-CoV-2 Receptors – Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2)The cellular surface receptor ACE2, a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). It is speculated to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 viral target for entry. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect multiple organs in part due to the widespread distribution, expression, and polymorphisms of ACE2 [28,29].ACE2’s molecular function in the human RAAS pathway is to cleave Angiotensin I to produce Angiotensin 1–9, and break down Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1–7. RAAS moderates blood pressure and osmolarity by means of hormonal feedback control. In response to binding of ACE2 to the ACE2 receptor (ACE2R), blood vessels vasoconstrict. This process is mediated by G-protein-signaling, activating phospholipase C and increasing cytosolic Ca2+concentrations. ACE2 also plays an important role in inactivating Des-Arg9-Bradykinin (DABK), a bradykinin involved in inflammation. This inactivation promotes C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIPS2), keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC), and tumor necrosis factor-〈 (TNF-α) activity, drawing leukocytes into the affected tissues [30].Decreased ACE2 receptor expression can have detrimental effects. Computational models of COVID-19 suggest the role of a bradykinin storm in the pathophysiology of the disease. In this model, the Kallikrein-Kinin and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Systems are integrated, with cross-talk mediated by the degradation of bradykinin by ACE and prolylcarboxypeptidase [31]. This behavior makes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein behave akin to an ACE-inhibiting drug [32]. Thus, disruption of ACE2 expression from SARS-CoV-2 binding can lead to altered tissue function and exacerbate disease.The ~600-kDa trimeric S proteins can bind to ACE2 through the RBD required for membrane fusion (see Fig.2). The binding initiates viral internalization, with the cleavage of S1/S2 inducing a conformational change from prefusion into post-fusion. S1 consists of the NTD, the RBD, and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2). S2 contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide and is responsible for the viral and cell membrane fusion [33]. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein shows varying states of conformational shifts of the RBD site progressing towards proteolytic processing, making the viral RBD more accessible to ACE2, with the cleavage at the S1/S2 leading towards RBD open confirmation and viral internalization [33,34]. The S- and RBD-viral sites are notable for affecting transmission and disease severity, and variants have been shown to accumulate mutations at these sites leading to increased S- and RBD affinity with ACE2 [35]. Understanding the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 surface interactions will help elucidate how the virus can invade multiple organ systems and cell types.Calcium Ion (Ca2+) SignalingThe calcium ion (Ca2+) is essential for many aspects of cellular physiology and viral replication. Experimental data on the relation between Ca2+signaling and SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication is sparse. However, studies of other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) have reported that these viruses utilize Ca2+for host fusion [36]. The fusion protein (FP) of MERS-CoV binds to one Ca2+ion, while the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has two FP domains, FP1 and FP2, and binds to two Ca2+ions for host cell entry [37]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to affect cellular function by altering the host Ca2+homeostasis in ways that promote viral infection and reproduction (see Fig.3). One mechanism is through disruption of calcium channels and pumps (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, transient receptor-potential ion channels, and Ca2+-ATPase) [28,37]. This leads to increased intracellular Ca2+concentrations, resulting in virus-induced cell lysis [28,37]. The interaction between the virus and VGCCs may also promote virus-host cell fusion for entry [28].Fig. 3. SARS-CoV-2 effects on Ca2+signaling.Open in a new tabStructural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above).Viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming proteins that alter membrane permeability to ions including Ca2+by forming membrane channels, are a characteristic of a diversity of virus. SARS-CoV-1/2 each encode viroporins. SARS-CoV-1 encodes for three viroporin proteins ORF3a, E and ORF8b, which alter ion homeostasis within the cell, and have important roles in pathogenesis and promoting viral fitness. SARS-CoV-2 encodes two of these viroporin proteins, E and ORF3a; however, the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent from SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b and lacks the viroporin sequence of SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b.The E and ORF3a proteins of coronaviruses impact Ca2+homeostasis in the host, by acting as calcium ion channels, enhancing the virion’s entry and replication potential [38]. The SARS-CoV-2-E protein is a 76 amino acid (aa) integral membrane protein with one transmembrane domain (TMD) that allows the E protein to form protein-lipid channels in membranes that promote permeability to Ca2+ions. The SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a protein is 274 aa in length, harbors three helical TMD, and is a Na+or Ca2+ion channel protein. The alteration of Ca2+homeostasis by SARS-COV-1-E and SARS-COV-2-E proteins promotes SARS-CoV-1/2 fitness and elicits the production of chemokines and cytokines, contributing to pathogenesis. Ion channel activity modulation by the SARS-CoV-1-ORF3a protein also modulates viral release [39]. Therefore, when SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body, the resultant dysregulation of Ca2+homeostasis may contribute to morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients have been noted to have low serum calcium levels overall [40].We speculate that Ca2+dysregulation could lead to increased cellular oxidative stress and shifts in metabolic activity. Low Ca2+may also be coupled with viral infection and internalization through the ACE2R, which synergizes with Ca2+signaling pathways. Understanding these reverberations will increase our insight into the basic biology of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the various organ systems.Intracellular signalingViral infection and hijacking of cell-surface receptors begin to trigger activation of multiple intracellular pathways in addition to Ca2+signaling. As infection proceeds, SARS-CoV-2 manipulates, or totally reprograms, the normal metabolism and signaling of the host cell, optimizing the molecular environment to enable the viral replication cycle. This involves interfering with signaling pathways that regulate processes of DNA repair and replication, immune response, transcription, metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis [39].SARS-CoV-2 infection alters phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), Type I and III interferon, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer (NF-κB) pathways. These pathways are dysregulated in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize host antiviral responses and are vital for viral replication, entry, propagation, and/or apoptosis/viral release. For instance, severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory profile dominated by NF-κB activity [41]. The SARS-CoV-2-encoded NSP13 and Open Reading Frame 9c (ORF9c) proteins can interact directly with elements of the transducin-like enhancer (TLE) family of proteins and thus regulate the NF-κB inflammatory response [42]. While broad activation of NF-κB is induced by a variety SARS-CoV-2-encoded products, Open Reading Frame 7a (ORF7a) specifically is a potent stimulator of NF-κB associated proinflammatory chemo- and cytokines, which are elevated in the presence of severe COVID-19. NF-κB plays a similar role in other coronavirus infections.Host antiviral immunity requires an optimal and coordinated response to control viral infections; this immunity is mediated by several host sensors, notably pattern recognition receptors (PRR). PRRs identify damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via the endosomal compartment, and may activate TLRs, such as TLR4, resulting in increased NF-κB activity and expression [42,43]. The MyD88-mediated TRIF activation of TLR downstream pathways triggers the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), resulting in the expression of innate immunity proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], interleukin-6 [IL- 6], TNF-α) and interferons (IFNs). Continuous activation of TLR can increase MyD88 and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which then can further activate NF-κB [43]. RNA viruses are detected by several sensors, such as TLRs 3, 7 and 8. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 single stranded RNA. In addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, viral proteins can act as PAMPS and potentiate inflammatory signaling through the stimulation of surface TLRs. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2, TLR2 is a critical mediator of envelope protein detection and driver of pathogenesis through inflammatory process augmentation [44]. Some individuals with severe COVID-19 have mutations in genes associated with type I and III IFN pathways [45]. Ten percent of individuals that progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia display elevated amounts of neutralizing antibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω [46]; these antibodies are not present in healthy or asymptomatic individuals. Of note, albeit TLR3 activation is critical for viral clearance, TLR3 hyperactivation can lead to a cytokine storm and the subsequent severe COVID-19. Other receptors are also involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition, such as the proteins of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). Once inside the cell, double strand viral RNA can be recognized by RIG-I/MDA5, thus initiating an antiviral response through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). MAVS activated the downstream pathways, IκB kinase α/β (IKK) and TBK1/IKKε, leading to translocation of NF-κB and/or IRF3 into the nucleus and induction of genes involved with innate antiviral immunity and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).Inhibition of IFNs and ISGs is a tactic used by several viruses to evade host antiviral responses [47], and SARS-CoV-2-mediated IFNs and ISGs dysregulation appears to be an important strategy used by this virus to replicate and disrupt immune homeostasis. Furthermore, therapies with type I and III IFNs alone or combined with other drugs suppressed SARS-CoV-2, ameliorating COVID-19 disease [48].The cytokine TGF-β triggers the Janus kinases (JAKs) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (JAK/STAT) pathway in certain contexts, while suppressing it in others [49]. It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins, particularly NSP1 and ORF6, may dysregulate STAT1 and STAT3, leading to a positive feedback loop where coagulopathy triggers TLR4 via PAI-1 binding, circularly activating STAT; for this reason, therapeutic targeting of the Janus kinase pathway has been proposed [50].The innate immune response is a first step to protecting against pathogens, which stimulate the interferon signaling pathway and expression of IFN-I, leading to an antiviral cellular response [51]. Coronaviruses have developed mechanisms to hinder IFN-expression and reduce the production of IFN. This suppression has been shown to correlate with disease severity and mortality [52]. This holds true for SARS-CoV-2, with recent studies showing that viral proteins ORF6, ORF8, and nucleocapsid being potent inhibitors of the IFN-I signaling pathway [53].Metabolic adaptationsViruses rely on host cell machinery to propagate, promoting anabolism for generation of macromolecules needed for virion replication and assembly (see Fig.2). Consequently, viral proteins (see Supplementary Table1) affect intracellular pathways, leading to subsequent adaptations by the cellular metabolism where the mitochondria plays a central role.We reported recently through study of COVID-19 patient samples (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab samples, various organs from autopsy COVID-19 samples, murine lung tissues, and various organs from hamsters being infected with SARS-CoV-2) that heavy suppression occurs of mitochondrial functions in various organs [54]. Specifically, in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus blocks the transcription of discrete groups of mitochondrial genes from major bioenergetic organs, while upregulation occurs in others as a compensatory mechanism to rescue the damage occurring in the major bioenergetic organs. This demonstrated a dynamic evolution of mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energetics as the virus progresses from one organ to the next. Transcriptomic changes in the nasopharyngeal infected samples revealed that during initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, nDNA coded mitochondrial genes are blocked and the co-inhibited genes were found to group together as components of preassembly modules of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, II, III, IV and V. At the time of death for COVID-19 patients, we showed virtually all mitochondrial function were inhibited in the heart, suggesting cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in longer term COVID-19 pathology. In addition, mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response were highly dysregulated throughout all organs. Lastly, mitochondrial inhibition was shown to activate HIF-1α and its target genes shifting cellular metabolism away from catabolism and towards viral synthesis. Our results indicate that manipulation of mitochondrial function may be an important approach for mitigating the severity of COIVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocytes [55] and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial (HPAEpiC) cells [56] induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production, increased HIF-1α protein levels and upregulated expression of HIF-1α target genes [57]. The stability of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) during a SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 replication [55–57]. The expression of ORF3a in human embryonic kidney 293 T-antigen cells (HEK293T) cells increased the stability of HIF-1α and induced mROS production, which is an activator of HIF-1α. Together these results suggest that ORF3a induces mROS production to activate HIF-1α, which in turn triggers a shift in cellular metabolism to favor glycolysis, resulting in increased viral replication and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Following host cell infection, the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex synthesizes ~30 kb viral genomes as well as the subgenomic RNAs required to encode for viral structural and mechanistic proteins. Between 1–5 h post-infection, the percentage of coronavirus-encoded protein per total cellular protein translation may increase by as much as 20,000 times, with the fraction of viral to cellular RNA ultimately reaching as high as 90% intracellularly [58]. To accommodate this huge shift towards viral replication, there is certainly a requirement of a shift in cellular metabolism to accommodate for viral synthesis. An investigation of SARS-CoV-2 metabolism during the initial 48-hours post viral infection showed that amino acid availability and synthesis are altered,de novopurine synthesis intermediates are accumulated, intracellular glucose and folate are depleted, and lactate levels are elevated [59]. This suggests a viral strategy of upregulating purine metabolism at the post-translational level to coincide with the shutting off of the majority of host proteins at translation levels.Virus-infected cells also commonly exhibit the Warburg effect - increased glycolytic metabolism in the presence of inadequate oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation - to supply reducing equivalents and precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis, and to support generation of ATP needed for also increasing nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis. Metabolic shifts include dysregulated Ca2+signaling and increased mitochondrial generation of ROS. How SARS-CoV-2 induces host cell nucleotide metabolism remains unanswered.Mitochondrial metabolism and function are highly impacted in multiple ways. With the shift towards glycolysis, there is a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation affecting the mitochondria and its function. SARS-CoV-2 may interact with the mitochondria to destabilize its oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Coronavirus replication requires the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These DMVs serve as a site for viral replication and help conceal the virus from host cellular defenses. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress is known to induce mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that communicate with the ER. It is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 disruption of mitochondrial function results in the induction of (double-membrane) MDVs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in the mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased DMVs can provide opportunity for viruses to hide and replicate [60].SARS-CoV-2 and all subgenomic RNAs are enriched in the host mitochondria, and viral genome’s 5ʹ - and 3ʹ -UTRs contain distinct mitochondrial localization signals [61], indicating that the viral RNA may hijack the mitochondria, an interesting hypothesis for experimental validation [61]. Other recent studies have mapped physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins with mitochondrial localized proteins. These interactions include: NSP8 interaction with mitochondrial ribosomal protein s2 (MRPS2), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s5 (MRPS5), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s25 (MRPS25), and mitochondrial ribosomal protein s27 (MRPS27) ribosomal proteins; ORF9c interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 1 (NDUFAF1) and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 9 (NDUFB9); ORF10 interaction with TIMM8; and NSP7 interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 2 (NDUFAF2). NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, NDUFB9, and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 10 (NDUFA10) are all key players in the assembly of complex I, and NDUFA10 is suggested as being one of the master regulators of the SARS-CoV-2 pathology [7]. Interactions were also observed between viral M protein and ATPase Na+/K+Transporting Subunit Beta 1 (ATP1B1), ATPase H + Transporting V1 Subunit A (ATP6V1A), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACADM), Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Beta (PMPCB), Pitrilysin Metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1), Coenzyme Q8B (COQ8B), and Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Alpha (PMPCA); these proteins are each components of critical mitochondrial metabolic pathways. SARS-CoV-2-encoded ORF9b protein interacts and localizes with Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 70 (TOMM70) [7], a mitochondrial import receptor important for transporting proteins into mitochondria and, more importantly, in modulating anti-viral cellular defense pathways [62]. These mitochondrial interactions offer glimpses of the viral effect on glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and the potential side effects.Another example of COVID-19’s mitochondrial-related impacts is the over-production of cellular ROS [63]. ROS and reactive nitrogen species have diverse functions in biological systems; oxidatively attacking pathogens, regulating cell proliferation, and key signaling functions [64]. However, dysregulation of ROS is implicated in many diseases, including the hyper-inflammatory late phase of COVID-19 [65]. As a part of normal redox metabolism, superoxide radicals are converted into hydrogen peroxide by the action of superoxide dismutase. The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently broken down into water by glutathione peroxidase. During COVID-19, isoforms of enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, may be directly targeted and proteolyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 protease, Mpro.SARS-CoV-2 is thought to suppress the ROS-associated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage. Dysregulation of the Nrf2 pathway will exacerbate the pro-oxidative stress caused by the virus [66]. SARS-CoV-2 may suppress the accumulation of the selenoprotein transcripts, which are crucial for the correct functioning of Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) and mitochondria function [67]. This redox impairment would lead to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide, which could trigger inflammation by promoting the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-κB, and the nuclear NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [68].Due to the multiple effects of SARS-CoV-2 that alter cellular metabolic and oxidative states, there are multiple directions to deplete NAD+, loss of cellular ATP and reduced Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) activity, each of which have cytotoxic effects of their own [69]. In general, NADPH, synthesized from NAD+, is necessary for many key redox reactions; a reduced level of NADPH could play a mechanistic role in cellular metabolic changes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.SARS-CoV-2 mediated reduction in ATP and nitric oxide signaling induces cell stressCellular metabolism adapts to the alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cell (see Fig.4). These adaptations depend on the cell and tissue type. Here, we focus on ATP signaling, which is relevant to epithelial cells, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which tends to be perturbed in endothelial cells [70]. Activation of each pathway at low levels provides protection to the host.Fig. 4. SARS-CoV-2 viral internalization & cellular hijacking.Open in a new tabMetabolic pathways and shifts that lead to cellular dysregulation and viral activation to lead towards viral replication (above).ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and other pathways is critical to support cellular physiology, but this molecule also has signaling properties, which can be particularly beneficial in epithelial cells [70]. Perturbations in ATP generation induced by the virus in epithelial cells [71] can lead to ATP release from the apical or basolateral spaces, and subsequent extracellular ATP signaling [72]. It can stimulate P2 receptors on neighboring epithelial cells to activate signal transduction pathways and alter cellular function in adjacent cells even if they are not infected, thus priming naive host cells for confrontation with the virus [71,72].In the endothelium, nitric oxide directly affects mitochondrial metabolism through interaction with cytochrome C, providing cytoprotection against free radicals. However, reduction of NO bioavailability, due to the increased oxidative stress state caused by SARS-CoV-2-elevated superoxides, results in the formation of peroxynitrites (ONOO-). The reduced NO diffusion to neighboring vascular smooth muscle may impair vascular function [73]. Peroxynitrite also causes injury to the mitochondria and reduces ATP synthesis, with all of the concomitant negative effects. Therefore, loss of NO bioavailability has major cellular consequences, inducing shifts in multiple enzymatic pathways, cell injury, and death.Like ATP, NO acts as a biological signaling molecule. This dissolved gas rapidly diffuses across cell membranes and regulates various functions across the body [73]. The vascular endothelium is the predominant cellular source of NO production, and it plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular function. Factors that reduce endothelial NO production (increased oxidative stress, changes in NO synthase synthesis) negatively affect endothelial function [73]. The cascade of inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by COVID-19 leads to the formation of superoxide free radicals, impairing biological processes and increasing cytotoxicity in the host cells [74]. The instantaneous reaction of superoxide and NO yields ONOO-, a powerful, cytotoxic nitrating agent. This reaction effectively destroys the NO, rendering it unavailable for its normal regulatory purposes. Thus, the downregulation of NO bioavailability is thought to be a central factor in the severity of COVID-19-associated endotheliitis and the onset of endothelial dysfunction [75]."

        "Title": "Changes in nuclear shape and gene expression in response to simulated microgravity are LINC complex-dependent.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMicrogravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth.\nKeywords:\nLINC complex, simulated microgravity, nuclear morphology",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe nucleus is the largest organelle of the cell and homeostatic control of its shape and position are known to be crucial for cellular functions such as cell migration, cell division and the regulation of gene expression [1,2,3,4,5]. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton and external mechanical stimuli are directly transmitted to the nuclear surface through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex [3,6,7,8,9,10,11]—a series of proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE). Thus, LINC complex Nesprins on the outer nuclear membrane are connected to different cytoplasmic cytoskeletal elements and to several other force-generating motor proteins. These Nesprin family proteins also have a KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology) domain that is located in the perinuclear space and connects to the SUN (Sad1 and UNC-84) proteins of the inner nuclear membrane [12]. The SUN proteins are in turn connected to chromatin through lamins. This mechanical connection from nuclear surface to chromatin is crucial in enabling the forces from the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) to be transmitted to both the surface and interior of the nucleus. These forces can, therefore, alter not just nuclear morphology but also internal elements such as chromatin architecture and so lead to the modulation of mechanosensitive gene expression.Exposure of cells to microgravity is known to lead to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the ECM. In addition, microgravity leads to morphological changes in both the cell and its nucleus, and to altered gene expression [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]—all features related to LINC complex function. The LINC complex is also known to be a critical factor in the normal formation and development of tissues, such as the breast cell acinus [21]. Simulated microgravity (SMG) achieved by clinorotation disrupts features such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and cytokine production [13,22]. These are all LINC-regulated processes, and failure in their normal functioning has been linked to aberrant developmental regulation, such as cancer. Indeed, in addition to altering all these LINC-dependent features, SMG also suppresses tumor cell growth and development in e.g., breast epithelial cell cultures [23]. However, despite such circumstantial evidence, the role of the LINC complex in cellular responses to altered gravitational environments has yet to be studied. Therefore, we have asked how the LINC complex affects changes in nuclear shape and differential gene expression in SMG. We report that the nucleus requires an intact LINC complex for its shape to be modulated by altered gravity conditions. We also identify LINC-dependent genes associated with this response, indicating that elements of the genome regulation normally seen in altered gravity requires an intact LINC complex."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO\n2\n-enriched anoxic atmosphere.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nStudies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on\nBacillus subtilis\ncells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlanning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration; furthermore, these agencies have recognized the International Space Station (ISS) as the best available platform to conduct research activities to address these challenges (International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 2013;National Research Council [NRC], 2014).Studies conducted during short- and medium-duration missions (from a few days up to ~1 year) in vehicles such as Spacelab, Soyuz, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS have provided a wealth of information concerning astronaut health and function in the spaceflight environment of low-Earth orbit (LEO;Taylor, 2015). Based on the knowledge gained from these missions, NASA has developed successful risk mitigation strategies. However, long-duration missions (greater than 1 year) into interplanetary space are more likely to expose astronauts to new and higher risks to their health and performance than excursions to LEO, primarily due to: (i) chronic exposure to microgravity; (ii) increased exposure to ionizing radiation from solar and galactic sources; and (iii) extreme confinement and isolation (Reitz, 2008;NRC, 2011;Zeitlin et al., 2013;Taylor, 2015). One particular concern for planners of long-duration missions is the possibility of infectious disease (Scott-Conner et al., 2015;Taylor, 2015). Prolonged exposure to the stresses of spaceflight can lead to dysregulation of astronauts’ immune systems, thus increasing their susceptibility to infectious disease (Crucian et al., 2009;Guéguinou et al., 2009;Taylor, 2015). To minimize the possibility of bringing infectious disease agents onboard, pre-launch mitigation protocols are in place such as screening astronauts for certain microbes and irradiation of food (NASA, 2010). However, the essential nature of the human microbiome (Cho and Blaser, 2012) renders it impossible to remove all potentially infectious microorganisms from astronauts. Indeed, deterioration of astronauts’ immune systems in space has led to increased reactivation of latent viral infections by Varicella–Zoster, Epstein–Barr, and Cytomegalovirus during 12–16 day Shuttle flights (Mehta et al., 2014). Opportunistic bacterial infections of the urinary tract, upper respiratory tract, and subcutaneous tissue have been documented from Shuttle missions STS-1 to STS-108 (Sams, 2009), and conjunctivitis, respiratory tract, and dental infections were documented among long-term inhabitants of space station Mir (Ball and Evans, 2001).Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how bacteria themselves respond to the human spaceflight environment, with particular regard to the possibility of their enhanced pathogenic potential or resistance to antimicrobial treatments [reviewed extensively inRosenzweig et al. (2014)]. In some spaceflight experiments, it has been observed that spaceflight can lead to enhanced virulence in some bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, andPseudomonas aeruginosa), but not in others (S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureusMRSA,Enterococcus faecalis, andListeria monocytogenes; note: inS. typhimurium, both cases have been observed in different spaceflight experiments; reviewed inRosenzweig et al., 2014). Taken together, the data suggest that the combined phenomena of altered astronaut immunity and heightened virulence of some microbes in the spaceflight environment might lead to an increased incidence of astronaut infections by some opportunistic pathogens during extended missions (Klaus and Howard, 2006).Space stations start out as basically clean environments, but upon habitation, they are rapidly colonized by numerous environmental and astronaut-associated species of microorganisms, which proceed to adapt and evolve in response to selective pressures unique to the spaceflight environment (Novikova, 2004;van Tongeren et al., 2007). A number of opportunistic pathogens have been isolated from space station crew quarters and from astronauts, including both Gram-positive genera (Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, andStreptococcus) and Gram-negative genera (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Flavobacterium, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, andYersinia;Ilyin, 2005;Klaus and Howard, 2006). From studies of astronauts on space stations Mir and ISS, it was documented that the microbial diversity of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was lowered during spaceflight, while the proportion of opportunistic pathogens increased. In addition, extensive exchange of microbial flora of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts has been documented among astronauts sharing confined space habitats [reviewed inTaylor and Sommer (2005)]. Recent microbial monitoring of the ISS environment revealed thatBacillusandStaphylococcusspp., are the most ubiquitous organisms cultured from the ISS, being especially abundant in samples taken from crew quarters, vacuum debris, and HEPA filters (Venkateswaran et al., 2014;Checinska et al., 2015). Not surprisingly,Staphylococcus epidermidiswas the most frequently encountered organism in the ISS microbiome, due to its close association with humans as a skin commensal (Venkateswaran et al., 2014).As on Earth, antibiotics are the predominant treatment of choice for bacterial infections on human spaceflight missions. Knowledge about the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions to treat infections during spaceflight is limited, given the difficulty to assess the interplay between pharmacokinetics of antibiotics or the physiologies of host and microbiome, both of which are altered in the spaceflight environment (Wotring, 2012;Taylor, 2015). Decreased susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics has been observed in the space environment during experiments performed onSalyut 7(Tixador et al., 1985) and the Space ShuttlesChallenger(Lapchine et al., 1986) andDiscovery(Tixador et al., 1994).Mutation is a common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. A body of evidence indicates that the spectrum of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance can be altered by the environment to which microbes are exposed (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;Nicholson and Park, 2015), including the spaceflight environment (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments described here, we chose to study mutations leading to resistance to the antibiotic rifampcin (Rif), because: (i) Rif is a clinically relevant antibiotic used singly and in combination to treat a wide variety of infections; and (ii) RifRmutations are easily identified by nucleotide sequencing, as they reside within small regions of therpoBgene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Severinov et al., 1993).Taken together, the above observations indicate that the possibility must be considered of antibiotic-resistant strains emerging, and potentially becoming dominant types, in the microbiomes of crew members. Therefore, to explore the development of antibiotic resistance in a potential opportunistic pathogen during long-term human habitation in space, the present communication describes experiments using the biological research in canisters (BRIC) hardware in which growth ofS. epidermidis, as well as the frequency and spectrum of mutation to RifR, were measured after spaceflight on the ISS and compared to asynchronous ground controls (GCs)."

        "Title": "Experimental Evolution of Bacillus subtilis",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature increases of 2–4 °C remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted experimental evolution on six wild\nBacillus\nstrains from two lineages (\nBacillus cereus\nand\nBacillus subtilis\n) to examine their thermal adaptation strategies. We exposed the bacteria to gradually increasing temperatures to assess their thermal plasticity, focusing on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation. While\nB. subtilis\nlineages improved growth at highly critical temperatures, only one increased its thermal niche to 4 °C above their natural range. This finding is concerning given climate change projections.\nB. cereus\nstrains exhibited higher mutation rates but were not able to grow at increasing temperatures, while\nB. subtilis\nrequired fewer genetic changes to increase heat tolerance, indicating distinct adaptive strategies. We observed convergent evolution in five evolved lines, with mutations in genes involved in c-di-AMP synthesis, which is crucial for potassium transport, implicating this chemical messenger for the first time in heat tolerance. These insights highlight the vulnerability of bacteria to climate change and underscore the importance of genetic background in shaping thermal adaptation.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBacteria are often regarded as highly adaptable to extreme environmental changes, including rising temperatures driven by global warming. However, this perception oversimplifies the complexity of bacterial adaptation and does not account for the millions of years it has taken for the diversity of bacteria to adapt to particular niches. This highlights that their adaptive capacity is deeply rooted in long evolutionary processes.Understanding bacterial responses to heat stress is critical, given their central role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability, especially as global temperatures are projected to increase by 2 to 4 °C [1,2]. The impact of rising temperatures extends beyond bacterial physiology, with significant consequences for ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles; for example, elevated ocean temperatures alter nitrogen-fixing microbial populations, threatening the nitrogen cycle in coral reefs [3]. Similarly, warming freshwater ecosystems decreases bacterial diversity, disrupting ecological balance [2]. Rising temperatures are also linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance [4,5] and increased abundance of pathogens likeVibrio choleraein coastal waters [6]. These examples underscore the urgency of understanding bacterial thermal adaptation in the context of global climate change.Phenotypic plasticity—the ability of organisms to adjust their traits in response to changing environmental conditions [7,8]—allows species to buffer against environmental fluctuations. This adaptability can extend an organism’s ecological range, potentially leading to genetic assimilation, where initially flexible traits become genetically stabilized [9]. Nevertheless, plasticity has inherent limitations and costs, especially under sustained stress [10]. Reaction norms, which describe how a genotype’s phenotype changes across environmental gradients, are valuable tools for assessing thermal limits and understanding adaptive strategies. We can learn about a given organism’s thermal niche through reaction norms (Wolterek, 1909 [11], cited by Stearns [12]). Mesophilic bacteria, such asEscherichia coli[13] and someBacillusspecies [14], typically thrive between 27 °C and 40 °C.When exposed to higher temperatures, mesophilic bacteria activate a heat-shock response (HSR), which involves the rapid production of heat-shock proteins that stabilize cellular components and temporarily protect against heat stress [15,16]. However, these adaptations are generally short-lived and insufficient for prolonged survival under extreme temperatures.Escherichia coli, as a well-established model organism, has been extensively studied for its physiological responses to thermal stress. Unlike thermal tolerance, which temporarily protects cells from heat damage by activating heat-shock proteins [17], thermal adaptation requires genetic changes that can withstand and sustain growth at higher temperatures beyond the initial threshold [18].Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for gaining insights into the capacity of bacteria to adapt to specific biotic and abiotic challenges and understanding the types of mutations that shape or enable such adaptations to changing environments [18,19]. It allows researchers to address a key question in evolutionary biology: whether bacteria can evolve similar phenotypic outcomes through the same or different genetic mechanisms—a phenomenon known as convergent evolution [20,21]. Convergent evolution can manifest in multiple ways, including traits that arise via a conserved genetic mechanism within a clade or through distinct mechanistic bases even among closely related species.Previous experiments have documented a rapid adaptive response ofE. colito high temperatures [22], with evidence that the genetic response can be diverse [23]. Similarly, Tenaillon et al. [24] took a whole-genome approach to estimate the extent of evolutionary convergence that occurs during adaptation in 115 populations ofE. coliat a high temperature of 42.2 °C, analyzing the overall genetic basis of adaptation. Their findings highlighted convergence among genes, with the most mutated gene beingrpoB, along with proteins that regulate therpoSstress response (RSS).Although numerous studies have explored the ability ofE. colito evolve at different temperatures [25], few studies have aimed to evolve bacteria to expand their thermal niche. In this context, Murata et al. [26] subjected anE. colistrain to 43 °C and identified 51 genes crucial for thermotolerance, highlighting the diverse genetic pathways involved in developing heat tolerance. Murata introduced the term “critically high temperatures” (CHT) to describe temperatures beyond the thermal limit.Bennett and Lenski [13] sought to isolate evolved lines capable of surpassing the upper thermal limit and found that this limit did not significantly increase in any of the derived lines, even those that evolved at 41–42 °C. Exposure to 44 °C proved lethal, except for one thermotolerant mutant, which managed to grow at 44 °C [27]. Mongold et al. [28] further investigated evolutionary adaptation to what they termed a “lethal thermal environment” by directly shifting evolution to 44 °C. Their findings revealed that three thermotolerant mutants were derived from two progenitor lines that had previously adapted to 41–42 °C, suggesting that these lines extended their upper thermal limit in a stepwise manner relative to their progenitors. Additionally, they noted that not all evolved lines exhibited trade-offs, such as a loss of fitness at lower temperatures.Bacillusstrains are particularly important to study in the context of prolonged survival at temperatures exceeding their niche range because they are ubiquitous and ecologically significant, playing key roles in decomposing organic matter and nutrient cycling. AlthoughBacilluscan form heat-tolerant spores that remain dormant for decades, their heterotrophic functions occur only in a vegetative state. Therefore, understanding whetherBacilluscan evolve more heat-tolerant vegetative cells is crucial for predicting how these bacteria will respond to global warming. Recent research has shown that wildBacillusstrains exhibit considerable variation in thermal tolerance, influenced by genetic background [14], emphasizing that temperature is a critical factor affecting bacterial growth and survival. Despite extensive research on acute bacterial responses, the long-term evolution of bacterial thermotolerance and the upper thermal limits they can achieve remain poorly understood and research has not been conducted onBacilluslineages.This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating whether wildBacillusstrains from two distinct lineages can evolve heat tolerance in their vegetative cells through experimental evolution. We aim to determine whether gradual temperature increases enable these bacteria to develop the plasticity needed to survive projected global temperature rises of 2 to 4 °C and to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying their adaptations. By focusing on different lineages and genetic backgrounds, our research explores the constraints and potential pathways for bacterial adaptation to extreme heat, providing insights into their evolutionary resilience and broader ecosystem impacts.The main conclusions of this work are as follows: 1. The observed lineage-specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses.B. cereusandB. subtilishave different plasticity andB. cereuslineages, contrary to those ofB. subtilis, and were not able to increase thermal tolerance relative to ancestral lines. Only one evolvedB. subtilisline successfully extended its thermal niche. 2. Tolerance to higher temperatures was observed inB. subtilislines that evolved constantly at 37 °C, indicating a metabolic adjustment driven by continuous growth conditions and the growth medium rather than selective pressure from increased temperatures. 3. Convergent mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis uncover, for the first time, its critical role in thermal tolerance. This discovery links molecular mechanisms to thermal adaptation across lineages. 4. Finally, our findings warn about bacteria’s inability to evolve significant thermal tolerance, even under gradual selection. This raises concerns about bacterial communities’ resilience to climate change and the potential cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;Foster, 2007;Nicholson and Park, 2015;Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). This phenomenon, dubbed Stress-Induced Mutagenesis (SIM), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work ofMaharjan and Ferenci (b).E. colicells were grown in chemostats under 5 different stresses, (limitation for carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron) or in a nutrient-rich environment, and loss-of-function mutations in thecycAgene leading to cycloserine resistance (CycR) were quantified, isolated, and subjected to fitness measurements (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). Although only 2 out of 5 stresses led to a significant increase in the mutation rate to CycR, all stresses resulted in distinct spectra of mutations incycAconferring a variety of alterations in fitness of the resulting mutants (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b).The human spaceflight environment presents its own unique set of physical stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions. Numerous studies have explored how microorganisms respond physiologically to spaceflight exposure (reviewed extensively inRosenzweig et al., 2014;Taylor, 2015). However, very few studies have asked whether microbial exposure to spaceflight might lead to SIM (Yatagai et al., 2000;Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). Such studies are relevant to astronaut health risk assessment, given the role that microbial SIM may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome. Long-duration human missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars are currently being planned (NASA, 2015), and both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration. NASA has implemented a three-phase approach to its long-term goal of the human exploration of Mars1. The first phase, to be accomplished in the present-to-mid-2020’s time frame, is dubbed the “Earth Reliant” phase, focusing on research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of crew health systems and technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. To date, only two studies have been performed exploring the notion that exposure of microbes to the stresses of the human spaceflight environment might result in SIM. First,B. subtilisspores containing a plasmid encoding theEscherichia coli rpsLgene were exposed to spaceflight in space stationMirvs. matched ground controls (Yatagai et al., 2000). The frequency of mutations inrpsLleading to spectinomycin resistance (SpcR) was found not to be significantly different between spaceflight and ground control samples, but sequencing of the mutantrpsLgenes from 25 spaceflight and 38 ground control samples showed distinct differences in the spectrum of mutations leading to SpcR(Yatagai et al., 2000). Second, the frequency and spectrum of chromosomal mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was measured inStaphylococcus epidermidiscells flown aboard the ISS and compared to matched ground controls (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In this experiment the frequency of mutation to RifRwas observed to be significantly (24-fold) greater in the spaceflight samples. Sequencing of therpoBgene from 67 spaceflight and 57 ground control RifRmutants also showed that the spectrum of mutations to RifRwas clearly different in the flight vs. the ground control samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016).From our previous results (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016), we concluded that RifRwas a good model to investigate SIM in spaceflight for a broad variety of microorganisms. Resistance to rifampicin derives from mutations within a small region of therpoBgene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Wehrli et al., 1968;Jin and Gross, 1988). This region corresponds to the Rif binding site of β (Campbell et al., 2001) and is highly conserved among prokaryotes (Severinov et al., 1993). Single-nucleotide substitutions inrpoBleading to RifRhave been shown to alter the global patterns of transcription, and resulting phenotypes, in several bacteria includingNeisseria meningitidis, Streptomyces lividans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, andStaphylococcus aureus(Hu et al., 2002;Maughan et al., 2004;Perkins and Nicholson, 2008;de Knegt et al., 2013;Colicchio et al., 2015;Villanueva et al., 2016). It is thus possible that mutation to RifRcould alter the response of microbes to the spaceflight environment.For the present study we chose to use as the test organism the Gram-positive bacteriumB. subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation; (ii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for spaceflight; (iii) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium; and (iv) development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. Thus, using the well-developedB. subtilissystem will facilitate the investigation in further detail of any potential novel mutations isolated inrpoB."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionOn 17 December 1946, the first documented experiment to study the response of a living organism to spaceflight was performed, with the launch and recovery of fungal spores on a V-2 rocket from White Sands, New Mexico [1]. Since that time, considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to understanding how living organisms sense, respond, and adapt to long-term spaceflight, particularly regarding their exposure to chronic microgravity. Extensive investigations conducted in space have resulted in a relative wealth of understanding of microgravity effects at the mechanistic level in eukaryotic organisms including humans [2], animals [3], plants [4], and protists [5]. In contrast to the situation in eukaryotes, it has proven more difficult to elucidate at the mechanistic level how single-celled prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) sense and respond to reduced gravity [6,7,8].In this hypothesis paper, we briefly review the state of our understanding of how eukaryotic cells sense, respond, and adapt to spaceflight microgravity, via various pathways responsive to the unloading of mechanical stress. We observe that prokaryotic cells possess many structures analogous to mechanosensitive structures in eukaryotes. We review and update the evidence indicating that prokaryotes possess and actively utilize mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms, and we expand upon existing models to include the role of the bacterial nucleoid in converting external mechanical information into the modulation of gene expression. This hypothesis builds upon, updates, and expands previous work in the field, to which the reader is referred for background information [9,10]."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nRNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In\nBacillus subtilis\n, mutations in the\nrpoB\ngene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in\nrpoB\nleading to rifampin resistance (Rif\nr\n) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which\nB. subtilis\ncells or spores are exposed. Rif\nr\nrpoB\nmutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by\nB. subtilis\n. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific\nrpoB\nalleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined.\nIMPORTANCE\nMicrobial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of\nBacillus subtilis\nin rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.\nKEYWORDS:\nBacillus subtilis\n, evolution, RNA polymerase, fitness, rifampin, rifampin resistance, transcription",

        "Title": "Analysis of interactions of Salmonella type three secretion mutants with 3-D intestinal epithelial cells.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe prevailing paradigm of\nSalmonella\nenteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that\nSalmonella\npathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal\nSalmonella\nstrains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more\nin vivo-\nlike models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized\nSalmonella enterica\nT3SSs. Similar to\nin vivo\nreports, the\nSalmonella\nSPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally,\nSalmonella\nstrains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2:\nflhDC\n) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a\nSalmonella\nactive process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed\nSalmonella\ndid not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for\nSalmonella\ninvasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling\nin vivo\ninfection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting\nin vivo\n-like pathogenic mechanisms.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionInfections with nontyphoidalSalmonellaserovars are a leading cause of bacterial enteric disease and are the single most common cause of death from food-borne illnesses in the United States[1]. An essential feature of the pathogenicity ofSalmonellais its interaction with host intestinal epithelial cells, whereSalmonellainvasion/entry into host cells is critical for bacterial survival and establishment of disease in a host. Currently, it is thought thatSalmonellainvasion of epithelial cells requires the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS), a Gram negative bacterial “molecular syringe” that injects effector proteins into the host cell cytosol, thus altering cellular functions[2],[3],[4].Salmonellapossesses two T3SSs that direct the secretion of proteins into host cells, and a third T3SS that directs the secretion of proteins to be assembled into the external flagellular organelle[5],[6]. The T3SS considered to be necessary for epithelial cell invasion is encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), a large region of theSalmonellagenome that contains numerous genes involved in pathogenesis and infection[6],[7],[8],[9]. The second T3SS is encoded on a second pathogenicity island, SPI-2, which is induced afterSalmonellainvasion of host cells and secretes protein effectors necessary for intracellular bacterial trafficking and replication[10],[11]. The third T3SS is under the transcriptional control of theflhDCoperon, the master regulator of the flagellum assembly machinery[5],[12],[13],[14].A significant portion of our knowledge regardingSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to asSalmonella)T3SSs and their role in infection of epithelial cells has been derived from studies that utilized non-polarized monolayer cell culture systems[6],[10],[15]. However, duringin vivoinfections,Salmonellainfects polarized epithelial cells of the host intestinal tract[16]. In recognition that conventional monolayer cell culture models do not display the structure, morphology, and architecture of the intestinal tract, more advanced andin vivo-like model systems have been developed and implemented to studySalmonellapathogenesis, which include polarized intestinal cell culture models, ileal loop models,C. elegansmodel, and mouse, cattle, and chick animal models[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26]. Studies utilizing these more complex model systems demonstrated that SPI-1 was critical in the establishment of aSalmonellainfection. While these model systems have certainly unveiled critical insight into the lifecycle and pathogenic mechanisms ofSalmonella, the majority of these studies have utilized non-human model systems to predict what potentially could be occurring during infection of humans. Moreover, it was shown that the severity and role of SPI-1 and 2 to cause infection bySalmonellaTyphimurium depends on the host species, which further complicates data extrapolation to the human condition[21],[23],[27]. The importance of host species in investigating and understanding the mechanisms ofSalmonella-induced gastrointestinal disease was further demonstrated in a recent key study looking at a naturally occurringSalmonellaoutbreak in humans, which revealed conflicting results as compared to monolayers and non-human animal models[28]. Specifically, the study identified two clinical isolates ofSalmonella entericaserovar Senftenberg present in stool samples from a food-borne human disease outbreak that lacked essential SPI-1 T3SS structural components and SPI-1 encoded secreted effectors[28]. Infection of mice with these isolated strains displayed little to no intestinal pathology or inflammation, suggesting these bacterial strains are limited to cause only human enteropathology. Furthermore, these naturally occurring SPI-1 deficient strains invaded human monolayer cells less efficiently than laboratory constructed SPI-1 mutants, further demonstrating differences between monolayer systems andin vivooutcomes of infection.Collectively, these studies demonstrate how differentSalmonellainfection model systems can give conflicting results, with the most dependable and accurate model being the natural host. Unfortunately, a humanSalmonellainfection model is unrealistic and impractical, in turn the next best model system would be one that best approximates the parental tissuein vivo. To achieve anin vitrocell culture model that more closely mimicsin vivocellular characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, multicellular complexity, mucus production, apical/basolateral polarity, and well developed tight junction formation[29], our laboratory utilizes the Rotating-Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor system (Figure 1). The gentle fluid rotation of the RWV creates a physiological low fluid shear environment that allows the cells to grow in three-dimensions, aggregate based on natural cellular affinities, and differentiate into human surrogate tissue-like models possessingin vivocharacteristics not observed in the same cells grown as monolayers[30],[31],[32],[33],[34],[35],[36]. In this study we use a RWV-generated organotypic 3-D model derived from the colon epithelial cell line, HT-29. HT-29 cells were chosen as the model cell line in this study because a) they have been extensively characterized in 3-D and shown to be a physiologically relevant model of the parental tissue from which they were derived[32], b) they represent the primary site ofSalmonellaintestinal infection[37], c) we have previously applied this system to model fundamental aspects of the host-pathogen interactions withSalmonella[32], and d) numerous studies have been conducted using this cell line grown as monolayers to study the initial stages of the host-pathogen interaction betweenSalmonellaand intestinal epithelium that lead to gastrointestinal disease[18],[32],[38].Figure 1. Depiction and operation of the RWV cell culture system.Open in a new tabA) Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor containing cell culture media and porous microcarrier beads. B) Sedimentation of cells within the RWV is offset by the rotating fluid, creating a constant free fall of the cells through the culture medium, allowing the cells to form 3-D aggregates under conditions of physiological fluid shear. Three-dimensional aggregates are taken out of the bioreactor for analysis including light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (i), or seeded evenly in a 24 well plate format for various profiling and infection assays (ii). C) Enlarged representation of intestinal epithelial cells attached to microcarrier beads of a 3-D aggregate. After intestinal epithelial cells adhere to the beads, they begin to differentiate and displayin vivo-like characteristics such as narrow columnar cellular morphology, basement membrane, tight junctions, mucus, and microvilli[31],[32],[36]. D) A further enlarged depiction of a single bead within the 3-D aggregate displaying characterized cellular surface structures and components, and infected withSalmonella.In this work, we demonstrate several key aspects ofSalmonellapathogenesis during infection of RWV-derived 3-D organotypic models of human colonic epithelium that mimicin vivoobservations, but contradict prevailing paradigms established using monolayers and many non-human model systems. We report for the first time thatSalmonellais able to invade 3-D intestinal cells independently of all knownSalmonellaT3SSs, including SPI-1 and SPI-2 encoded T3SSs and the flagellar secretory system regulated by theflhDCoperon[13]. Within the 3-D intestinal epithelial aggregates, we were able to identify three different epithelial cell types that are present in the human large intestine, further showing the complexity and physiological relevance of the 3-D intestinal model. Unlike previousin vitroreports, there was no identifiable preferential host cell type targeted in our 3-D intestinal models during infection by wildtype or the T3SSSalmonellamutants[39],[40],[41],[42]. Non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial-size beads, and heat-killedSalmonelladid not appear to be localized intracellularly in 3-D intestinal cells, demonstrating that an active bacterial invasion mechanism(s) is necessary for internalization, rather than a non-specific host cellular uptake mechanism. Following invasion of 3-D cells, the SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2 double mutant, and the SPI-1/2flhDCtriple T3SS mutant, all grew to similar levels intracellularly, but to substantially lower levels than wildtypeSalmonella. Collectively, we provide evidence that our highly differentiated 3-D models of human colonic epithelium exhibit infection phenotypes that are consistent with anin vivoentericSalmonellainfection. To our knowledge, this is the first report that bacterial invasion, but not intracellular growth, is largely independent of the functions encoded by TTSSs."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of\nin vivo\ntissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.\nWe describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe opportunistic pathogen\nStaphylococcus aureus\nencounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment,\nS. aureus\nwas evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence.\nS. aureus\ncells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest\nS. aureus\nresponds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nInvestigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender,\nCryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi\n, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of\nC. a. bishopi\nhave been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of\nC.a. bishopi\n. Bacterial isolates included\nAeromonas hydrophila\n, a known amphibian pathogen,\nGranulicetella adiacens\n,\nGordonai terrae\n,\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia\n,\nAerococcus viridans\n,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nand a variety of Pseudomonads, including\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n,\nP. stutzeri\n,\nand P. alcaligenes\n.

Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to\nC. a. bishopi\nmay not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in\nC. a. bishopi\nmay have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees[1], including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution, increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation, introduced species and disease, including infectious disease[2],[3]. Although evidence of disease in amphibian populations is not new, early literature on amphibian health in natural populations is quite scattered, deals primarily with anurans and/or local problems, or was initiated because of concerns related to supply and demand and decline of commercial harvest[4]–[6]. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, various biological supply houses noted problems in the commercial supply of amphibians causing Maugh[7]to comment on “the apparent short supply and diseased state of amphibians collected in nature”.The review of mycoses of amphibians by Reichenback-Klinke and Elkan[8]primarily focuses onBasidiobolus ranarumandSaprolegnia parasiticaand indicates the dearth of knowledge relating to the distribution and importance of microfungi associated with amphibians. With few exceptions, this void continued for the next two decades[9]–[12]. The impetus for research on amphibian microbes became a major focal point of the 1stWorld Herpetology Congress in Canterbury, England in 1989, where herpetologists shared their observations on declining frog populations and developed initial strategies to investigate the potential problems. The discovery that the chytridiomyceteBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a zoosporic fungus related to infectious oomycete water molds,Saprolegniaspp., was capable of causing lethal dermatitis in amphibians led to a proliferation of studies[13]. After reviewing studies of microbes implicated in amphibian population declines, including chytridiomycosis,Ranavirusdisease, saprolegniosis andRibieroiaspp., Daszak et al.[14]concluded that “available data provide the clearest link for the fungal disease amphibian chytridiomycosis”. Herpetological Review dedicated an entire section to amphibian chytridiomycosis geographical distribution[15]–[17].The advances in research on the secretions, structure, and functions of amphibian integument and their products reveal a remarkable complexity of bioactive secretions and diversity of amines, peptides, alkaloids, bufodienolides, and other compounds[18],[19]. The presence of antimicrobial agents in amphibian skin hypothesized by Csordas and Michl[20]and Croce et al.[21]has led to an increased interest in the relationship of the bacteria and fungi present in the skin of amphibians and the antimicrobial peptides and metabolites that they produce[22]–[30]. Some of these peptides and alkaloids can inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi[31],[32]and common cutaneous bacteria from the terrestrial salamanderPlethodon cineruscan inhibit pathogenic fungi[33]. Evidence also suggests that symbiotic bacteria may contribute to innate immune defense of some amphibians[30]. While evidence suggests that these antimicrobial compounds and symbiotic bacteria can provide some level of protection for amphibians against microbial invaders[30]–[33], the connection between disease and amphibian decline has been confirmed for some amphibian populations[34]. However, long-term amphibian studies, especially those including population and environmental data, are so rare that we have very few data to support many claims related to decline or changes in, or the health of, wild amphibian populations[35]. One long-term study subject, the Ozark Hellbender,Cryptobranchus alleganensis bishopi, and its habitat within a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River (NFWR), has been the subject of numerous investigations since the intensive 110 day surveys conducted during 1969–1971[36],[37].In 1969, the 4.6 km research section within the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, was a crystalline, substantially spring-fed stream located in the least densely human populated area of the second least densely populated county in the state (9 people/sq mi;[38]). Only one rarely used sportsman's cabin graced the banks of the research section in 1969. The springs and occasionally the river were used as drinking water by some locals and visitors. From 1969 to 1980, 169 days of skin-diving surveys, coupled with environmental sampling, were conducted in this section, including some in every year and within every calendar month, but not every month of every year[39]. Population and ecological studies of the aquatic Ozark HellbenderC. a. bishopiand its habitat were conducted in this section during 1969–1971[36],[37]. Other ecological studies included year-round water quality, benthic habitat, macro-invertebrate structure, cottid fish diet studies, and numerous shorter-term studies[36],[40]. These early studies in the NFWR found an immense and healthy population ofC. a. bishopi, as many as 428 individuals/km, and almost no abnormalities/injuries. Only 2.9% of 479 individuals observed in 1969 were abnormal/injured and they exhibited rapid regeneration capabilities[36],[39],[41]. Additional surveys between 1972 to 1980 continued to show immense and healthy populations of Ozark Hellbenders[27],[42]. All surveys during this time period ranged from between 9–12 individual Ozark hellbenders collected per hour per person (Nickerson et al, unpublished data). Reassessment of the ecological characteristics of the NFWR conducted in 2004–2007 revealed extensive habitat alteration and degradation, including increased land development, siltation, sedimentation, and water quality degradation[43]. Community changes included algal and nuisance aquatic vegetation blooms, otter establishment, and fish and macroinvertebrate community alterations[43]. Canoe use within the NFWR significantly increased[43]. Intensive surveys of the NFWR hellbender population conducted in 2005 yielded only 55 individuals, of which 26 (i.e., 47%) had visible abnormalities/injuries, including loss of limbs, limbs with exposed bones, and degeneration of other tissues which did not regenerate or had remarkably retarded regeneration (J. Briggler, unpublished data). The high prevalence of abnormalities/injuries and the lack of the historically characteristic (rapid) regeneration of injured/affected tissue in hellbenders in the NFWR was the impetus for our examination of the microbial community associated with the observed abnormalities/injuries."

A subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases[1],[2]. One of the important aspects of the fitness ofE. coliis thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including varied anatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions. Extra-intestinal pathogenicE. coli(ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds, resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden[3],[4]. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans include urinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) and septicemia[4]. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian PathogenicE. coli(APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections, mainly respiratory, often leading to death[4]. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin[4]emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derivedE. colistrains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks[5],[6], which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir forE. colicausing ExPEC infections in humans.ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross-protective vaccines[7]. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated with certain clinical syndromes. For example,E. colifrom a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75% of urinary tract infections[8]and a limited number of serotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly implicated in avian colibacillosis[9], suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties[10],[11]. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated[12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19].Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanisms of their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology of bacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanisms of fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changing conditions would not only improve our understanding of their persistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments.Previously, the model APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3, previously named pAPEC-1, pAPEC-2, and pAPEC-3 respectively, and a cryptic plasmid pChi7122-4 (Table 1), has been used to undestand the role of large plasmids in the virulence of ExPEC[12]. Specifically, we determined that both the nature of plasmids and their combinations have an effect on the virulence and the genetic diversity of ExPEC. Although we have clearly determined that pChi7122-1 has a major role in systemic infection of APEC in chickens, the role of the remaining plasmids remained unclear.Table 1.

Therefore, this study aimed to (1) fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain χ7122; and (2) evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well the plasmid pChi7122-1, either individually or in combination, in the bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Moreover, since the plasmids can be carried by strains with different backgrounds, we aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated phenotypes. This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of APEC strain χ7122 and provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nNoroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs a leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections,Pseudomonas aeruginosahas been extensively studied over the past 35 years. No currently availablein vitroorin vivomodel system is able to completely mimic theP. aeruginosadisease phenotype. Accordingly, the complexity of the host, pathogen and host-pathogen interactions has necessitated a combined use of different model systems to advance our understanding ofP. aeruginosainfectious disease.P. aeruginosais most commonly studied in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where chronic lung inflammation caused by this microorganism is believed to be the major source of mortality (Yang,et al., 2011,Doring,et al., 2012). In the thick, viscous CF lung mucus,P. aeruginosaprimarily exists as persistent alginate-overproducing (mucoid) biofilms that adhere to mucus compounds, but not to lung epithelium, and are resistant to available antimicrobial agents and the host immune system (Hoiby,et al., 2010,Schobert & Tielen, 2010,Breidenstein,et al., 2011).P. aeruginosa-associated components (such as LPS, lectins, alginate) and secreted factors (such as quorum sensing molecules and pyocyanin) generate an extreme inflammatory response, which is destructive for the host but not the pathogen (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). Furthermore, acuteP. aeruginosainfections frequently occur in patient populations with a damaged epithelial barrier (such as in burn wound patients, following intestinal surgery, at insertion sites of catheters or endotracheal tubes, or in scratched cornea), or compromised immune system (such as HIV and cancer patients) (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). During acute infections, disease or injury-related epithelial modifications that mediateP. aeruginosaadhesion are believed to contribute to the infectious disease process, thereby necessitating direct host-pathogen interactions (Engel & Eran, 2011). Herewith, the type three secretion system (T3SS) (Lee,et al., 2005), various adhesins (such as lectins, flagella and type IV pili) and secreted virulence factors dictate the course of disease (Engel & Eran, 2011).In vitrocell and tissue culture models have served as useful platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms and phenotypic properties from both the host and pathogen side that underly the infectious disease process. While manyin vitromodels are oversimplistic and lack key properties of the parental tissue, increasing efforts are made to design more physiologically relevant models, and to explore their potential forP. aeruginosapathogenesis studies. At the other extreme are animal models, which have advanced our knowledge on variousP. aeruginosa-induced illnesses, but often do not mimic human physiology and disease, are complex and require extensive expertise. Since manyin vitrofindings have been confirmed using animal models (Pier,et al., 1996,Martin, et al.,Bucior,et al., 2013,Cory,et al., 2013), it is relevant to utilizein vitromodel systems to initially explore fundamental questions and to verify select findingsin vivo. This approach can significantlyrefineandreducethe use of animal models. Finally, with promising ongoing projects, such as Donald Ingber’s human-on-a-chip (Marx,et al., 2012), complex multi-organ systems might one day be engineered which could accomplish the third “R”,replacementof animal models.The host microenvironment affects virulence properties ofP. aeruginosa. Therefore, mimicking the host microenvironment is essential for the development ofin vitroinfection models that better mimicin vivophenotypes ofP. aeruginosa, which will facilitate the design of novel efficacious antimicrobial treatments. In this review, we highlight that the choice of the model system, and the host characteristics that it mimics, can significantly impact theP. aeruginosaphenotype and outcome of the infection study. For detailed information about the immunomodulatory, cytotoxic and detrimental effects thatP. aeruginosaand its virulence factors exert on the host during acute and chronic infections, we refer readers to excellent reviews (Sadikot,et al., 2005,Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). This review describesin vitromodel systems of mucosal tissues with increasing complexity that reconcile key characteristics of the host involved in theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process. However, before discussing these models and thein vivotraits that they mimic, we start by providing a concise overview of host factors that affectP. aeruginosadisease initiation and progression, regardless of whether they are modified byP. aeruginosaupon host encounter. Given that mostP. aeruginosainfections are located in mucosal tissues, we focus on this infection site, with particular emphasis on the lung."

        "Title": "Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Immune System",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTo address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks\nbefore\ninfection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks\nbefore\nexposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.\nKeywords:\nChronic hydration, Hypertonicity, COVID-19, Mortality, ACE2 receptors, VEGF, AQP5, SGK1, Saliva osmolality, Drinking water intervention",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nStrategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects over 64 million people worldwide and is predicted by the World Health Organization to become the third leading cause of mortality by 2030. While allogeneic lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment for the growing number of patients with end-stage lung disease, only one out of four patients on the organ waiting list undergoes transplantation, given the limited availability of donor organs. Moreover, the clinical success of lung transplantation is hampered by lifelong immunosuppression and chronic rejection, reflected in a 10–20% survival rate 10 years post-transplantation [1].A promising option to increase the donor organ pool is to use allogeneic or xenogeneic decellularized lungs as a scaffold to engineer functional lung tissueex vivo[2–7]. Decellularization of mouse, rat, goat, sheep, pig, non-human primate and human lung tissue has been accomplished with several detergent-based approaches as well as with freeze-thaw cycles, and resulted in three-dimensional (3-D) acellular scaffolds that are generally devoid of detectable residual DNA and nuclei [2–17]. While the decellularized lung scaffolds produced by different methods generally retain major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, several ECMs can be less abundant (e.g., collagen I, collagen IV), fragmented (fibronectin) or largely absent (elastin) as compared to the native tissue [2,5,8]. Repopulation of decellularized lungs has been reported using a number of different cell types, including transformed cell lines such as A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, fetal lung cells, endothelial cells, embryonic stem cells (ESC), fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), primary or immortalized airway and alveolar epithelial cells, and bone marrow or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [2–17]. However, apart from use of fetal lung homogenates in combination with A549 and vascular endothelial cells, only partial recellularization of alveoli, airways and pulmonary vasculature has been achieved [2,8,15,18].One potential approach to improve recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is to use the dynamic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, which has been shown to promote growth and differentiation of stem and/or epithelial cells (in the presence or absence of a growth substrate) [19–21]. The RWV is an optimized form of continuous suspension culture wherein cells are cultured in horizontally rotating bioreactors that are completely filled with media [22]. The bioreactor rotation offsets sedimentation, creating a constant, gentle fall of cells and their growth substrate/scaffolds through the culture medium under conditions of physiological fluid shear [23–25], such as those encountered in the interstitium [26]. Under these conditions, gentle media mixing and excellent mass diffusion are obtained [22]. The RWV technology has been used to generate differentiated lung tissue culture models, with important applications in the fields of infectious disease and regenerative medicine [7,22,27,28–31]. Specifically, tumorigenic A549 lung epithelial cells cultured alone and in combination with functional macrophages on the surface of extracellular matrix-coated porous microcarrier beads exhibited phenotypic reversion towards a more normal differentiated phenotype [27,28,31]. Moreover; when challenged with respiratory pathogens and their toxins, these 3-D lung models exhibited a morein vivo-like response as compared to conventional 2-D monolayers of the same cell line [27,28]. In the field of lung regenerative medicine, the RWV has been used to differentiate mESCs into multiple distal respiratory epithelial cell types using conditioned medium, which could not be obtained using static culture [29]. Cortiellaet alused the RWV for repopulating various natural and synthetic ECM scaffolds with ESCs, including decellularized lung scaffolds [7]. While this study demonstrated enhanced cell differentiation and viability of ESCs on decellularized scaffolds compared to other ECM scaffolds in the RWV, the authors focused on the role of different ECM scaffolds (and not on RWV growth conditions) as identical static controls were not included. Therefore, it remained unclear whether the standard RWV culture conditions (~20 RPM) that enhanced cellular differentiation and growth in previous reports [27–29,31], could be utilized to improve recellularization efficiency and stem cell differentiation in decellularized lung scaffolds.In this study, we examined whether the use of the RWV would (i) enhance recellularization efficacy using two relevant mouse cell types, i.e. bone marrow derived MSCs and alveolar type II epithelial cells (C10), and (ii) affect differentiation of the inoculated MSCs in the decellularized lungs."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn vitro cell culture models comprised solely of either epithelial cells or macrophages cultured as monolayers are often used to studySalmonella entericainfections, as both cell types play critical roles in the infection process.1,2Following ingestion,Salmonellaactively invade and replicate within intestinal epithelial cells and are engulfed by macrophages upon crossing the epithelial barrier, where they exploit phagocytes as a preferred niche for replication and transport.3While classic two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding the interactions betweenSalmonellaand host tissues during enteric infection, they lack the multicellular complexity and three-dimensional (3-D) architecture that are important for the differentiated structure and function of the in vivo parental tissue.4–7Synergism between epithelial cells and macrophages is important for driving responses of both cell types.5,8,9Not surprisingly, monotypic (single cell type) cultures of either epithelial cells or macrophages respond differently to challenge with pathogens or their toxins as compared to co-culture models containing both of these cell types, the latter of which demonstrate a synergistic phenotype that better reflect the in vivo response.5,10Indeed, it is widely recognized there is an urgent need for advanced in vitro cell culture models that mimic the complex 3-D architecture, multicellular complexity and phenotypic characteristics of in vivo tissues for use in predictive human disease modeling, including infectious disease.4,5,11–13Accordingly, achieving a deeper understanding of host–pathogen interactions at the intestinal mucosa requires cell culture models that incorporate 3-D architecture, differentiation and multicellular complexity to characterize the interaction between epithelial cells and macrophages during enteric infection.The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor is a NASA biotechnology that was designed to mimic aspects of the quiescent, low fluid shear culture environment found in microgravity in order to facilitate the formation of 3-D tissue-like aggregates in the laboratory.4,14,15This low fluid shear suspension culture system has served as a powerful ground-based tool to enable the establishment of highly differentiated 3-D cell cultures, including both mono﻿typic (originating from a single cell﻿ type) and co-cultures (multiple cell types)4,10and has been used to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal epithelial models to study enteric infections.4,7,16–20Our lab was first to apply RWV-derived 3-D cell cultures to study bacterial host–pathogen interactions, including 3-D intestinal epithelial models forSalmonellapathogenesis,7,17,18and 3-D lung epithelial models co-cultured with macrophages forPseudomonas aeruginosapathogenesis.10The underlying concept of the RWV (Fig.1) is to enable cell growth in three dimensions, aggregation based on natural cellular affinities (facilitating co-culture of different cell types), and differentiation into 3-D tissue-like assemblies.4Cells are grown on porous extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated microcarrier beads which serve as scaffolds upon which they adhere, thereby allowing cells to respond to chemical and molecular gradients in three dimensions (apical, basal, and lateral) akin to the in vivo scenario. When the RWV is completely filled with medium and rotation initiated, cells are maintained in a physiological low fluid shear suspension culture environment with high mass transfer of nutrients and waste, which is optimal for growth and differentiation.4,21Fig. 1.Open in a new tabDevelopment strategy for 3-D co-culture model of human intestinal epithelium and macrophages.AExperimental design for 3-D co-culture model development. HT-29 cells were initiated as adherent monolayers and U937 cells as suspension cultures. U937 cells (1 × 107) were treated with PMA for 48 h in the presence of ECM-coated, porous microcarrier beads to allow attachment. Following treatment, PMA was removed from the U937 cells. At the same time, HT-29 cells were trypsinized, counted and added (2 × 106) to the U937-bead mix. The RWV was loaded with cultures, filled completely with media, and bubbles removed. Routine daily media changes began 4–5 days after initiation of cultures.BAssay set-up for infection studies. 3-D aggregates were removed from the RWV, counted and evenly seeded into multi-well plates. Light micrograph magnification = 100×.CDepiction of a single collagen-coated microcarrier bead (blue) covered with HT-29 cells (brown) and U937 cells (red)We previously used the RWV to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal organotypic models derived from human epithelial cell lines and demonstrated their ability to predict in vivo infection outcomes andSalmonellapathogenic mechanisms.7,16–18While initiated from a single cell type, these epithelial models spontaneously differentiated into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the intestine, including enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M/M-like cells, while exhibiting extensive tight junction formation, apical-basolateral polarity, and mucin production. Following infection withSalmonellaTyphimurium, these 3-D epithelial models exhibited phenotypes consistent with in vivo infections in animals and humans, including alterations in tissue morphology, adherence, invasion, apoptosis, and production of cytokines.7,16–18Moreover,S.Typhimurium invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all knownSalmonellatype three secretion systems, i.e. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system,7a major finding that paralleled in vivo infection observations in both animals and humans,22–27and challenged the paradigm established by 2-D monolayers that SPI-1 is always required for invasion of intestinal epithelium. Similar results were recently reported using a 3-D intestinal organoid model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which showed that a TyphimuriuminvAmutant was still able to invade into the model, albeit at lower levels than the wild type.6Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of 3-D tissue models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.These results led us to postulate that our 3-D intestinal epithelial model could serve as a high fidelity platform for engineering an improved version able to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity normally encountered bySalmonelladuring enteric infection. We focused on the addition of macrophages, as they are a key immune cell type targeted bySalmonelladuring infection, and intracellular survival in these cells is essential for the virulence of this pathogen.3,28While in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that macrophages may contribute toSalmonella-host specificity and are able to distinguish between the closely related pathovars Typhimurium and Typhi, these studies have shown inconsistent trends, likely due to differences in experimental design and implementation.28–31This area of study is of keen interest given the devastating epidemic of invasive multidrug resistant non-typhoidalSalmonella(iNTS) infections in sub-Saharan Africa linked to a genetically distinct sequence type (ST) ofS. Typhimurium, ST313, which has undergone genome degradation similar to that of host-adaptedS. Typhi.32S.Typhimurium is classified as a generalist in terms of its host specificity, causing disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. While usually associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans,S.Typhimurium can cause serious systemic infection in the immunocompromised. Conversely,S.Typhi is a human-specific pathogen that causes systemic illness and typhoid fever.3,33Thus, there is concern that ST313 may be evolving toward a human-specific adaptation similar to Typhi. However, very limited information is available regarding host-pathogen interaction characteristics and host specificity of ST313, although recent studies using ST313 strainD23580found that it causes invasive disease in animals and lethal disease in mice, indicating it is not a human-specific pathovar.34–36Herein, we report advancement of our previously developed 3-D HT-29 intestinal epithelial model7,17into a multicellular, co-culture model that provides additional complexity relevant to the intestinal microenvironment by incorporation of immune competent cells; specifically, functional macrophages. As 3-D intestinal epithelial models have been repeatedly shown to better mimic the differentiated structure/function of intestinal tissues, and respond in a more in vivo-like manner to challenge with enteric pathogens than 2-D monolayers, our comparisons in this study thus focused on the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models.7,17–19,37Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of the HT-29-U937 co-culture model revealed key in vivo-like structural and functional characteristics. To assess the impact of macrophages in this new co-culture model and validate its application as a human surrogate infection platform, we applied it to characterize infection profiles between closely relatedSalmonella entericapathovars with different disease phenotypes and host tropisms (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and ST313D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2). To further enhance the physiological relevance of the study, bacteria were cultured under aerobic or microaerobic conditions prior to infection, asSalmonellamust adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels during its normal life cycle both before and after entry into the host. This includes aerobic conditions prior to ingestion, anaerobic conditions in the lumen, and microaerobic conditions approaching the intestinal wall.38Our studies revealed that the 3-D co-culture model could discriminate betweenSalmonellapathovars and represents an innovative model for host-specific testing that can bridge knowledge gaps between 3-D epithelial models and in vivo studies to study host-pathogen interactions and unveil infectious disease mechanisms.To our knowledge, this work represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages. This study is an important step forward in developing a 3-D intestinal epithelial co-culture model that integrates immune cells to mimic the multicellular complexity of the parental tissue and its application to understand the synergistic contribution of different cell types to enteric host-pathogen interactions."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTissues and organs provide the structural and biochemical landscapes upon which microbial pathogens and commensals function to regulate health and disease. While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models. Collectively, these technologies provide a more physiologically relevant and predictive framework for investigating infectious disease mechanisms and antimicrobial therapies at the intersection of the host, microbe, and their local microenvironments.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nCandida albicans\nis a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans.\nC. albicans\nhas been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of\nC. albicans\nblooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied.

Finally,\nC. albicans\n-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionCandida albicansis a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals (1).C. albicansis an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3). Because of the severity of these infections,C. albicanspathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections,C. albicanslives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (4–6).One host setting associated with enrichment forC. albicansin the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption (7). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD (8).C. albicansis enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (9–11) and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD (9,10). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD (9), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host.The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain (12,13). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (14–17). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving (18). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving (19,20). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (21,22). These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption.As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2reduced ethanol consumption in rats (23). Serum PGE2levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization byC. albicans(24). Further, we previously showed thatC. albicanscolonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (25), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor (26). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered inC. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2in reducing ethanol consumption inC. albicans-colonized mice.In this study, we show thatC. albicansGI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption.C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2compared to mock-colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE2reduced ethanol consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption inC. albicans-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE2receptor antagonist treatment. These results show for the first time that changes to the fungal microbiome can alter ethanol preference and ethanol-induced behavior in mice."

        "Title": "Spaceflight enhances cell aggregation and random budding in Candida albicans.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThis study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen,\nCandida albicans\n, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that\nC. albicans\nsubjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured\nC. albicans\n–induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured\nC. albicans\n. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of\nC. albicans\nis suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of\nC. albicans\n. While culture of\nC. albicans\nin microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe presence of opportunistic pathogens in the normal flora of astronauts, in combination with their compromised immune system during spaceflight missions, puts this population at particular risk for infectious disease[1]–[4].Candidaspecies are commensal organisms that are found on human skin, in the oral cavity, and in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and vaginal tracts[5]and are consistently isolated from the spaceflight crew and environment[6]–[8]. These microorganisms become pathogenic under specific circumstances, which can lead to various infectious diseases ranging in severity from superficial mucous membrane infections (i.e., thrush) to life-threatening disseminated candidiasis[9]. Immunocompromised patients are at particular risk of developingCandidainfections[9].The risk for infectious diseases in astronauts becomes even more significant given previous reports that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the virulence and/or gene expression of obligate and opportunistic bacterial pathogens[10]–[12]. Two independent spaceflight experiments demonstrated that mice infected with spaceflight-grownSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (S.Typhimurium) exhibited decreased time to death and LD50values when compared to mice challenged with identical synchronous ground control cultures[11],[12]. Analysis of global transcriptomic and proteomic expression patterns ofS.Typhimurium grown in spaceflight conditions revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins were altered during culture in the microgravity environment of spaceflight[11], and identified a central regulatory role for the evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq. Hfq is an Sm-like (LSm) RNA chaperone that serves as a master regulator of bacterial responses to environmental stress, primarily by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the pairing of mRNA transcripts with cognate small non-coding RNAs[13]–[19]. Spaceflight also alters thehfqregulon inPseudomonas aeruginosa[10], and is involved in the spaceflight-analogue response ofS. Typhimurium,P. aeruginosaandStaphylococcus aureus[20]–[22]. Spaceflight-analogue conditions are obtained through culturing of microorganisms in rotating bioreactors, termed rotating wall vessels (RWV). In the RWV, cells experience low fluid-shear forces while being in continuous suspension, which mimics aspects of the unique microgravity environment[11],[23]–[25]. This specific growth environment is termed low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)[22].The response of eukaryotic microorganisms to spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue conditions has been previously reported.Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas been extensively studied since the early years of the space program. The first flight experiment with this organism was conducted in 1962 (reviewed in[26]). Detailed analyses indicated that yeast cells responded to microgravity by undergoing metabolic (e.g. increase in phosphate uptake[27]) and phenotypic changes (e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars[28]–[30]). A recent report showed enhanced production of the biochemical molecule S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in spaceflight-culturedS. cerevisiae[31]. Knowledge gained from these studies led to the engineering of a SAM-overproducing strain ofS. cerevisiae, with potential industrial applications. Moreover, studies describing the response ofS. cerevisiaeto spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV showed major phenotypic alterations in response to this environment[32]. Specifically,S. cerevisiaegrown in LSMMG conditions displayed increased cell clumping (or flocculation) and a random budding phenotype as compared to the bipolar budding pattern of the same cells grown in the control orientation of the RWV bioreactor[32],[33].While, to our knowledge, no reports exist on the response ofC. albicansto culture under true spaceflight conditions, studies have documented the response of this organism to ground-based spaceflight-analogue conditions in the RWV[34],[35]. WhenC. albicanswas cultured in LSMMG, this organism displayed increased randomness in the budding pattern, which is similar to the phenotype observed forS. cerevisiaeduring culture under the same conditions. In addition, whileC. albicansexisted as a predominantly yeast form when cultured under control conditions in the RWV bioreactor, increased filamentation and biofilm formation were observed when grown under LSMMG as determined by microscopy and morphology-specific gene expression profiling[34],[35].C. albicanscan transition from budding yeast to a filamentous (hyphal) form, which is responsive to environmental stressors and contributes to the organism's virulence[36]–[39]. Consistent with the conversion ofC. albicanscells to a filamentous form, a concomitant increase in expression of filamentous-specific genes that are also suggestive of biofilm formation was observed in response to LSMMG[34],[35],[40],[41].In addition to the importance of spaceflight research for infectious disease risk assessment during short and long-term missions, studying the behavior ofC. albicansto spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue culture conditions has important clinical applications[42],[43]. Indeed, the low fluid shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed in spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures are relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their lifecycles on Earth, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host[42]–[45]. Since we currently lack a complete understanding of the infection process of this medically important pathogen and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to controlC. albicansinfections[40],[41], insights gained from microgravity research holds potential to discover new infectious disease mechanisms and benefit the general public on Earth.The current study describes the response of the most prominent fungal human pathogen,C. albicans, to spaceflight culture conditions, flown as part of the NASA Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-115. In this report, we analyzed the global transcriptional profile and performed phenotypic analysis ofC. albicansduring short-term growth in spaceflight conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effects of spaceflight culture on the global gene expression and phenotypic changes of a eukaryotic pathogen."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThis report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of\nCandida albicans\ncultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads.\nC. albicans\nis a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general,\nC. albicans\nhad a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of\nC. albicans\nto microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, spaceflight, yeast, amphotericin B, caspofungin, antifungal, ISS, Space X, FPA, GAP, FEP bag",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionCandida albicans(C. albicans) is a commensal fungus found throughout the human body in locations such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin [1,2]. Most infections are superficial, such as fungal nails, yet as an opportunistic pathogen, this yeast is capable of causing severe, life-threatening illness in immunocompromised hosts; therefore, it is a potential concern for crew during long term spaceflight [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the dichotomy between the commensal and pathogenic behaviors ofC. albicansis complex and the molecular events responsible for converting a normally benign commensal into a highly pathogenic organism, which in systemic infections can produce 30–45% mortality, have not been fully elucidated [7,8,9,10,11]. Moreover, the therapeutic repertoire to treat systemicCandidainfections is limited [12]. There are four classes of antifungal agents used clinically, including polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B), echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), azoles (e.g., fluconazole) and nucleoside analogs (e.g., flucytosine) [13]. Amphotericin B (AmB) was utilized as an early therapeutic forCandidainfections and its derivatives remain among the most effective treatments for systemic disease [14,15,16]. For these reasons, AmB was chosen for analyses in the microgravity-associated susceptibility studies described herein. It has been proposed that AmB functions at the level of the cell membrane, where it interacts with the yeast-specific sterol, ergosterol, forming pores and compromising membrane integrity [13,15]. In contrast, caspofungin (CAS) was used to evaluate the yeast response to an antifungal agent harboring a mechanism of action distinct from that of AmB. Caspofungin compromises cell wall formation by inhibiting (1–3)-β-D-glucan synthase [11].C. albicansis a dimorphic eukaryotic organism consisting of spherical yeast form cells and elongated filamentous cells and has been shown to respond to environmental stresses such as temperature, pH, and altered gas environments with physiological characteristics often associated with virulence [17,18,19,20]. Indeed the extreme environment of microgravity presents a unique challenge for organisms that have evolved under normal gravity. Microgravity may provide novel environmental stress cues leading to physiological adaptations or may allow insights into molecular pathways otherwise masked by a gravity-based environment, such as that described for the PseudomonasHfqpathway [21,22]. Among the potential adaptations of interest are those properties ofC. albicans, on both the single and multicellular level, that enable it to infect an immunocompromised host. A well-studied phenotypic transition inC. albicansis filamentation, or hyphal/pseudohyphal formation, which can be induced by a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, pH, serum, elevated CO2and hypoxia [23,24,25]. The combination of filamentous and yeast form cells can also form biofilms, or multicellular communities, contributing to increased virulence and enhanced resistance to environmental insults. As such,C. albicans, particularly in community form, has been documented to have increased resistance to antifungal agents [4,26,27]. In short, this yeast is capable of altering its phenotype in a number of ways to become better suited for infection and the environmental cues responsible for initiating these transitions are numerous. Hallmarks of an infectious form ofC. albicansinclude robust growth, filamentation, biofilm production and resistance to antifungal agents. The studies included herein will focus on these yeast characteristics to determine whether microgravity represents an environmental cue with the potential to alter virulence.Due to limited access and the expense of spaceflight opportunities, ground-based simulators, such as rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines, have been used to generate a ‘modeled microgravity’ environment in order to predict the response of cells to spaceflight microgravity [28,29,30,31,32,33]. High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) are rotating-wall vessels that, by revolving about an axis perpendicular to the gravitational vector, create a state of functional weightlessness and minimal fluid shear within the chamber. Low-fluid shear may indeed be an important environmental signal for organisms cultivated in microgravity. Reduced convection and diminished bulk flow may resulted in an altered cell-associated microenvironment through depletion of nutritional components and accumulation of waste products [34]. Interestingly, when cultivated in analog bioreactors or in the true microgravity environment, many, but not all, organisms display morphological and genetic changes consistent with increased virulence and invasive behavior [22,31,35,36,37,38]. Previous studies ofC. albicanscultured in HARV bioreactors demonstrated adaptations that included cells with increased filamentation, increased resistance to the antifungal agent AmB, altered colony morphology, and altered biofilm complexity [29,31]. The studies described herein focus on whether exposure ofC. albicansto true microgravity induces similar adaptation responses to those observed in ground-based analog studies, especially as they relate to the potential for increased virulence. Embedded in these studies are comparisons between spaceflight experiments and between two separate flight hardware systems."

        "Abstract": "Graphical abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionOpportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020;Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012).The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets includeHomo sapiens(human),Mus musculus(mouse),Drosophila melanogaster(fruit fly),Arabidopsis thaliana(model higher plant),Oryzias latipes(Japanese rice fish),Helix lucorum(land snail),Brassica rapa(Fast Plant),Eruca vesicaria(arugula/edible plant),Euprymna scolopes(Hawaiian bobtail squid),Ceratopteris richardii(aquatic fern), and the bacterium,Bacillus subtilisfrom experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020).NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools.The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms.Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010;Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download.Figure 1.Open in a new tabGeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP)(A) The three broad steps of the RCP.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionFor decades, the health risks associated with space exploration have been increasingly documented and characterized. For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS). However, as humankind plans for a permanent presence on the moon and seeks to advance to Mars, the limits to our countermeasures and the research gaps that have insofar remained unaddressed will create health challenges that rival the engineering challenges of long-duration space missions.To gain a comprehensive understanding of how spaceflight affects the human body, the molecular responses of the body to spaceflight factors must be robustly profiled. Recent advances in omics technologies have already revolutionized our approach to understanding disease1,2,3and have created new pathways for tackling health challenges on Earth.4,5,6However, the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Furthermore, the microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on Earth. Therefore, given that the opportunities to study the influence of spaceflight on the human genome have historically been, and still are, limited, it is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards.The ISS is currently the only research laboratory available off-world and the source of the majority of spaceflight omics experiments performed to date. Most mammalian omics studies aboard the ISS have usedMus musculus, the standard laboratory rodent, as a model organism.7To scale the number of mammalian studies performed in space, NASA launched their rodent research (RR) program in 2014, with the first omics experiment published in the NASA funded GeneLab database in 2015.8,9Since the program began, the RR program has launched over a dozen missions generating a steady stream of new omics data on a variety of murine tissues and cell systems. These missions have proven essential for understanding the molecular response of terrestrial life to the environmental stressors of space by providing gene expression data for a subset of mouse tissues. These studies have helped illuminate changes within biological systems including the mitochondria,10musculoskeletal system,11circadian rhythm,12and microRNA (miRNA) profiles.13The majority of experiments from rodent tissue obtained via the RR missions have been subject to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), where the whole tissue is homogenized and RNA is extracted. Bulk transcriptomic assays are currently the most common omics assay performed in space biology, with more than 270 transcriptomic datasets available from spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue experiments in the NASA GeneLab database.7Of these studies, microarray-based experiments have been used to obtain approximately half of the gene expression data stored in GeneLab. As the cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) decreased, RNA-seq started to replace microarrays as the predominant method for spaceflight transcriptomic studies. However, given recent advances in the field of genomics, bulk RNA-seq is being displaced by higher-resolution methods rapidly on Earth. State-of-the-art tools can now resolve gene expression at the single-cell level via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)14or maintain 2D topography via spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT).15While these two types of approaches are becoming standard practice for gene expression research conducted on Earth, the collection protocols for cells and tissues obtained from experiments in spaceflight have not yet been optimized for the application of these methods.In this perspective piece, we present the current status of scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight experiments, the optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments, and the downstream computational tools that are used to obtain high-resolution gene expression insights."

Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m\n6\nA methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m\n6\nA levels immediately post-flight.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionBoth short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cellular systems1–3. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceflight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preflight performance4. Significant changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system during spaceflight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting transcriptomic profiles of human subjects have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, such as radiation or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic flight8. With regard to direct spaceflight exposure, the available transcriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few specific assays, either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term spaceflight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate after long-term spaceflight10, or examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the International Space Station11. However, beyond this limited work, there is scant data on the impact of human spaceflight on the transcriptome beyond the NASA Twins Study (1-year mission), and almost no data from short-duration missions. Moreover, there are no single-molecule, direct RNA datasets from astronauts, which can help detail changes in RNA methylation and base modifications while also capturing expression and isoform changes.To address this gap in transcriptome knowledge, eleven different biospecimen types underwent four types of high-throughput sequencing for each of the four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission12, including genomics, transcriptomics, immune profiles, microbiome, and some clinical blood tests13. Long read sequencing (LRS) technologies have potentially relevant clinical applications14, since they can capture both splicing and expression differences in full-length transcripts; nanopore long-read direct-RNA sequencing15is additionally advantageous since it provides per-base epitranscriptomic data (e.g., m6A modification sites)16. Here, we generated LRS samples taken before the flight (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), the day of landing (R + 1), and in recovery periods (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) after a 3-day spaceflight from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. A battery of computational and analytical approaches were deployed on these samples, including edgeR, DESeq2, ONT tools, Gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)17–19, as well as orthogonal sequencing on the Ultima UG100 platform, which generated an average of 413 million reads per sample. These data provided an opportunity to discern the utility of LRS technologies in studying the I4, as well as future astronaut cohorts, and will also enable meta-analyses in conjunction with other NASA Open Science Data Repository (NASA OSDR,https://osdr.nasa.gov/) short-read and single-cell data sets.We present these data sets and algorithmic methods as foundational functional genomics resources for human spaceflight, as part of a roadmap for future bioinformatics data analysis techniques for LRS data. These current results are in line with the mission of NASA OSDR, which aims to standardize procedures for future spaceflight missions and open science, enabling comprehensive comparisons between these astronaut and model cohorts20. We also implemented methodologies which allow for examination of differences in expression, splicing behavior, and methylation (m6A) at the same time. As such, we can observe molecular changes underlying blood transcriptome dynamics across an astronaut’s journey to space and back, which show thousands of changes across several hundred specific genes, some of which recapitulate known stress markers of the vasculature and immune system, as well as signatures of m6A changes, isoform switching, and hematopoiesis regulation that appear upon landing back on Earth."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOur human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in history, with more crewed launches and human presence in space than ever before1. We can attribute this to the commercial spaceflight sector entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies forming collaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astronauts into space. The recent advancements in human space exploration offer a significant chance to gather more biological research samples and enhance our comprehension of spaceflight’s effects on human health. This is vital, as our knowledge of the biological reactions to the unique environment of space, marked by microgravity and the space radiation, remains incomplete2. The impact of spaceflight on human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, cardiovascular adaptations4, vision changes5, space motion sickness6, neurovestibular changes7, immune dysfunction8, and increased risk of rare cancers9, among other changes2. However, we are still at the initial stages of documenting biological responses to spaceflight exposure at the molecular and cellular resolution.Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur during spaceflight in astronauts. These include changes in cytokine profiles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and hemolysis13. Furthermore, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structural changes in DNA14–16, RNA expression profiles11,17,18, sample-wide protein measurements17,19,20, and metabolomic status17. Additionally, International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been studied with longitudinal microbial profiles to track microbial pathogenicity and evolution to assess their potential influence on crew health21,22. To better improve our understanding of both human and microbial biology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and expand as more spacecraft and stations are built and flown.Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new spacecraft and stations is especially important to overcome the small sample sizes and highlights a need for standardization between missions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is difficult, as the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the time of writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok program, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, Project Gemini, Project Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the Space Shuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the breadth of experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only a minority have specifically been human research-oriented23,24, and just a subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study created the most in-depth multi-omic study of astronauts prior to Inspiration4, but was limited to one astronaut and one ground control17. These factors have limited the statistical power of astronaut omic experiments and increased the difficulty of providing robust scientific conclusions. Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will create larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions.Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A key goal of SOMA is to standardize biospecimen collection and processing for spaceflight, to generate high-quality multi-omics data across spaceflight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample collection methods built for standardized field collections across different crews and missions. We cover the decentralized sample collection process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized datasets with enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientific findings from spaceflight studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of past astronaut sample collections in scientific publications, and suggestions to refine sample collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were collected from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several other missions (Polaris Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued utilization for future crewed space missions."

The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nMartian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth.\nMethodology and Principal Findings\nDisabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionLong duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate air and clean water. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) scenarios envisioned for extended manned missions will depend upon the efficient use of local planetary resources and the recycling of limited materials such as water, pressurized atmosphere, and organic matter, while producing food to augment supplies[1]. The use of in situ regolith for plant growth in a future bioregenerative life support system on Mars may have several advantages over hydroponic systems[2],[3]. These include the immediate bioavailability of plant essential ions, low-tech mechanical support for plants, and easy access to in situ materials once on the surface. However, plant growth may be reduced or inhibited by phytotoxic substances in the regolith, such as high levels of soluble magnesium sulfate minerals. Hydrated forms of magnesium sulfate such as MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite) and MgSO4·H2O (kieserite) have been detected in several regions by the Mars Express Satellite[4],[5],[6]. Analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover landers at Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater have also indicated the presence of high levels of magnesium sulfate minerals (up to 10 wt%) in outcrops and soils[7],[8],[9].High levels of hydrated sulfate minerals in regolith on Mars used in bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2+and SO42−ions in the soil solution. Plants may have evolved to cope with relatively high levels of elements in the soil environment by limiting internal accumulation or tolerating high internal concentrations[10]. In a potential bioregenerative life support system on Mars, an excess of a particular element in the crew's diet could affect the availability of other required elements. This study therefore first determined whether knockout mutant lines for genes encoding certain transporters responsible for uptake of Mg2+and SO42−ions in roots could enhance plant tolerance to high levels of magnesium sulfate in the growth medium and then moved to a molecular analysis of the responses to Mg2+and SO42−in order to increase the potential pool of candidate genes.Various efforts have previously illustrated that the disabling of transporter genes can indeed improve tolerance to certain elements. For example, a line of transgenic wheat plants expressing an antisense construct of the high affinity K+transporter TaHKT2;1 showed reduced sodium uptake by roots and enhanced growth relative to unstressed plants compared to a control line at high levels of NaCl in the growth medium[11].Several plasma membrane localized proteins in the outer cell layers of Arabidopsis roots are known to be responsible for magnesium or sulfate ion uptake. Two specific genes,AtMRS2-10andAtSULTR1;2, were chosen for this study, in part because of their localization and because of availability of knockout lines.AtMRS2-10( =AtMGT1) functionally complemented a bacterial mutant lacking Mg2+transport capability and AtMRS2-10-GFP–expressing plants showed fluorescence in the periphery of root cells, suggesting a plasma membrane association[12].AtMRS2-10is, to date, the only member of theAtMRS2family that is known to be associated to the plasma membrane of root cells in addition to having Mg2+ion transport capability. Therefore, a knockout mutant line of theAtMRS2-10gene (mrs 2-10) was characterized for this study based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x T-DNA insertion line[13].AtSULTR1;2is a constitutively expressed sulfate transporter gene whose product AtSULTR1;2 is localized in root hair, epidermal and cortical cells where it ensures sulfate uptake into plants under sulfur-replete conditions[14]. A knockout mutant line of theAtSULTR1;2gene (sel1-10) was shown to take up 80% less sulfate than wildtype when grown for 12 days on agar with optimal levels (1.7 mM MgSO4·7H2O) of sulfate[15].Knockout lines of genes encoding vacuolar H+/Ca2+transporters CAX1 and CAX3 were also analyzed to present perspective of other, non-plasma membrane, cellular transporter locations. Thecax1-1andcax1/cax3lines were previously shown to be more tolerant of high Mg2+levels in the form of MgCl2when grown on agar[16],[17]. In a separate study, aCAX1knockout mutant was identified through a mutant screen on nutrient solutions reflecting low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of serpentine soils[18]. When high MgSO4·7H2O concentrations are applied, the Ca∶Mg ratio of the nutrient solution decreases, which therefore makes thecax1-1andcax1/cax3mutants candidates for high magnesium sulfate tolerance. This study determined whether enhanced tolerance to low Ca∶Mg ratios is maintained whencax1-1andcax1/cax3mutants are exposed to elevated SO42−in addition to elevated Mg2+in soil medium.These candidate genes for enhanced magnesium sulfate tolerance that are presented above were selected based on previous literature describing the results of individual gene or gene family analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of plants exposed to elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulfate, or magnesium sulfate in the growth medium have not been reported to date. In order to increase the number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing growth performance of plants exposed to this abiotic stress, root transcriptome remodeling in Col-0 was analyzed after short-term (45 min.) hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO4·7H2O. This early time point was chosen to capture part of the primary stress responses. The differential expression of transporter genes was analyzed after 90 min. and 180 min. in addition to 45 min., as this group in particular may represent a metabolic strategy for tolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. The root transcriptome of the transporter gene knockout mutantcax1-1was furthermore contrasted with that of Col-0 after both genotypes were exposed to MgSO4·7H2O treatment for 180 min. Based on their previously identified tolerance to high MgCl2and low Ca∶Mg ratios,cax1mutants are likely to show enhanced growth compared to wildtype when exposed to high magnesium sulfate levels. Furthermore, ionome analyses ofcax1mutants showed that they have significantly reduced levels of Mg2+in their leaves compared to wildtype[18].Thecax1/cax3double knockout mutant, while having the potential to show tolerance to elevated MgSO4·7H2O based on its tolerance to MgCl2and its reduced shoot levels of Mg2+, showed significant differences in concentration of multiple elements, and grew more slowly than wildtype under regular nutrient conditions[17]. Sincecax1-1mutants did not display negative effects on growth under regular nutrient conditions,cax1-1rather thancax1/cax3was included in the root transcriptome analysis. Genes differentially regulated betweencax1-1and Col-0 grown under stress conditions could reveal those molecular processes possibly leading to significant differences in growth performance at the whole plant level. A hydroponic medium was chosen to mimic root exposure to a specific soil solution in order to directly link transcriptome responses to the level of bioavailable ions that roots may experience in a hypothetical root zone of a regolith profile on Mars[19]. The treatment concentration of MgSO4·7H2O was based on the low Ca∶Mg ratio that can occur in serpentine soils on Earth. Because of their high amount of bioavailable magnesium, Serpentine soils can be seen as a partial analogue for regolith high in magnesium sulfate on Mars[20]."

This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.\nKeywords:\nChloroplast, photosensory system, plastid, 14-3-3 proteins, root development",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly known for their ability to bind certain phosphorylated proteins to complete phosphoregulation events (Ferl, 1996). In plants, 14-3-3 protein binding activity includes the regulation of key metabolic enzymes, such as nitrate reductase and sucrose synthase (Bachmannet al., 1996;Toroseret al., 1998), and also the activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Olssonet al., 1998;Fuglsanget al., 1999;Svennelidet al., 1999;Ottmannet al., 2007). Throughout eukaryotes, 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind a multitude of different proteins and, specifically, participate in a wide array of signal transduction regulatory events.Multicellular eukaryotes contain multiple 14-3-3 protein family members, or isoforms. The number of 14-3-3 isoforms can vary per organism, butArabidopsiscontains 13 expressed 14-3-3 genes (Wuet al., 1997;Rosenquistet al., 2001;Sehnkeet al., 2006). The 14-3-3 proteins throughout eukaryotes share sequence homology within the core region of the protein sequence, but sequences of individual isoforms diverge in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails. The importance of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms per organism remains to be elucidated, however, reverse genetic studies analysing knockout or knock down mutants continue to identify specific roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms (Suet al., 2001;Sugiyamaet al., 2003;Mayfieldet al., 2007;Purwestriet al., 2009).InArabidopsis, 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were utilized to find association of the 14-3-3 isoforms μ and υ with both light sensing during early development and time of transition to flowering (Mayfieldet al., 2007). Red light-grown 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibit decreased hypocotyl elongation inhibition (Mayfieldet al., 2007) reminiscent of, but not identical to Phytochrome B (PHYB) mutants (Koornneefet al., 1980). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also flower later in long-day conditions (16 h of light), but not in short-day conditions (8 h of light) (Mayfieldet al., 2007). In rice, the opposite phenotype occurs when manipulating expression of the 14-3-3 isoform, GF14c (Purwestriet al., 2009). Over-expression of GF14c results in delayed flowering, while knockout results in early flowering. These 14-3-3 mutant phenotypes indicate a role in light-related signalling for these particular 14-3-3 isoforms. The relationship of 14-3-3 proteins with light signalling is further supported by the observation that 14-3-3 proteins bind the blue light photoreceptor Phototropin 1 (PHOT1) (Kinoshitaet al., 2003) and the flowering timing regulation protein Constans (CO) (Mayfieldet al., 2007), as well as downstream targets such as Flowering Timing (FT) and Self-Pruning (SP) (Pnueliet al., 2001).Light perception is broadly important for phototropic responses, time of flowering, and root development. For example, Red and far-red light influence the directional growth of roots. Roots of some plants, such as maize and rice, grow horizontally in the dark, but grow downward when the plants are irradiated with red or far-red light from above (Takanoet al., 2001;Luet al., 1996). In addition, there is copious expression of photoreceptors in the roots (Pratt and Coleman, 1974;Somers and Quail, 1995;Tothet al., 2001), suggesting a functional relevance for photoreceptors in root development. Root hair development is enhanced by light and mediated by phytochromes (De Simoneet al., 2000a,b). Further, both Phytochrome A (PHYA) and PHYB regulate red-light-induced root hair development while far-red-induced root hair development is regulated by PHYA alone (De Simoneet al., 2000a).Photoreceptors also control chloroplast development in roots that are exposed to light. Prolonged exposure of plant roots to light stimulates the development of chloroplasts in the roots (Whatley, 1983). Chloroplast development in the roots is stimulated by red and blue light, with cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) as the primary regulators of blue light-stimulated chloroplast development and PHYB as the primary regulator in red light (Usamiet al., 2004).This study utilizes the previously described T-DNA insertion mutants of 14-3-3 μ and υ to examine the roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast development, that are controlled by the photosensory system. A 14-3-3μ knockdown mutant containing a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of 14-3-3μ,14-3-3μ-1(Mayfieldet al., 2007), exhibited shorter roots whose lengths were influenced by various light intensities. The 14-3-3υ knockout T-DNA insertion mutants, 14-3-3υ-1and 14-3-3υ-2(Mayfieldet al., 2007), each contain a T-DNA insertion within the 14-3-3υ coding region and also had shorter roots than the wild type, but only when grown under narrow bandwidth red light. In addition, the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and CO mutants (co) (co-1;Redei, 1962;Koornneefet al., 1991) exhibited an increase in chloroplast numbers after 5 d of growth."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.\nKeywords:\nArabidopsis, GRF, plant, subcellular localization, 14-3-3 isoform specificity",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nDuring medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity.\nMethods\nA hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed.\nResults\nWe found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid.\nConclusion\nOur results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionLong-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness.1Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions.2Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance.3,4Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.5,6Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability.3Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats.7,8Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors8. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts.9The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders.5,6Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts.In recent years, natural ingredients derived from plants or food, with the advantages of mild antibacterial activity, reparative action, and low resistance to human drugs, have shown broad application prospects in regulating the intestinal microecological balance.10As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng.11According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity.12In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed.13GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.14–17Because of its beneficial effects, CHM Taikong Yangxin prescription, which contains ginseng, has been used to keep Chinese astronauts healthy during their flights. In a previous study, we explored the potential of GTSs to maintain the neurological subhealth of astronauts.18However, the regulatory effect of ginseng on intestinal homeostasis under weightlessness conditions remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms related to gut-brain interactions remain to be explored. Therefore, we used the hindlimb suspension (HLS) model to evaluate the potential and possible mechanisms of GTSs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which will help to expand the health effects of ginseng and provide novel understanding and treatment options for health problems, starting with intestinal homeostasis during space travel."

        "Title": "Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µ\ng\n) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, gravitropism, Arabidopsis, proteomics, RNAseq, TMT, BRIC LED, International Space Station",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionNumerous plant spaceflight studies have long focused on unraveling the complex physiological changes plants undergo in the spaceflight environment. In their diversity, these studies have accumulated an extensive array of phenotypic characterizations and uncovered some of the fundamental concepts related to physiological adaptation in space (Kordyum and Hasenstein, 2021). However, the traditional approaches have recently been complemented and in many ways superseded by the advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods, setting the stage for high throughput analyses that investigates the effects of spaceflight on plants from a molecular and functional perspective (Hughes and Kiss, 2022). This allows the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment to be characterized beyond phenotyping and extensively mapped out along broader biochemical pathways and cryptic signaling molecular cascades. While some remarkable advancements in genomic and transcriptomics studies of plants in spaceflight have been widely recorded (Ferl et al., 2002;Paul et al., 2012;Barker et al., 2023), such studies have largely been conducted in isolation, independent of proteomics. Unlike genomic and transcriptomic studies, proteomics studies face certain limitations in the spaceflight context, predominantly due to the limited availability of plant tissues for analysis. As a result, comprehensive spaceflight proteomics studies conducted on the whole Arabidopsis plant have been relatively few, with only three reported so far (Mazars et al., 2014;Ferl et al., 2015;Barker et al., 2020;Kruse et al., 2020).Mazars et al. (2014)conducted the first true proteomics-scale study of Arabidopsis microsome-associated membrane proteins on the ISS followed byHausmann et al. (2014)study on the proteome of Arabidopsis cell cultures in parabolic flights andZhang et al. (2015)proteomic study on Arabidopsis callus aboard the Chinese SZ-8 spacecraft in spaceflight.Ferl et al. (2015)comparison of the transcriptome and protein abundances between the leaf and root of Arabidopsis in spaceflight represented the first use of a combined transcriptomics-proteomics investigative approach for whole plant spaceflight experiment, followed by a similar but more in-depth approach byKruse et al. (2020)where they revealed novel regulatory responses of Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight. Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight. Likewise, the reported low correlation between transcripts and proteome of Arabidopsis grown in spaceflight and spaceflight hardware (Basu et al., 2017;Kruse et al., 2017;Kruse et al., 2020) reinforced the benefits of a multi-omics approach.Studying plants’ adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand (Kanapskyte et al., 2021;Nicholson et al., 2021). One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white) (Howard and Caron, 2016). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source (Stankovic, 2018), with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues (Wolinska and Berens, 2019). Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity (Paul et al., 2013;Vandenbrink et al., 2014;Lamers et al., 2020) and other environmental stresses (Paponov et al., 2021). Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth.Therefore, building upon these previous achievements in plant multi-omics research in spaceflight, we took a significant step forward by integrating both proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to understand the response of Arabidopsis plants to the spaceflight environment. Through increased coverage and finer spatial proteomic resolution, we assessed the effects of the earth’s low orbit spaceflight environment aboard the ISS on the shoot and root of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seedlings were grown in the NASA BRIC LED hardware, hence we provided robust insight into the plant transcriptome landscape and organ-specific proteomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment, while at the same time conducting a hardware verification test for the novel BRIC LED hardware."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew\nBrachypodium distachyon\nseedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that\nBrachypodium distachyon\nseedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed\nArabidopsis thaliana\nseedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.\nKeywords:\nBrachypodium distachyon\n, Bd21, Bd21-3, Gaz8, microgravity, International Space Station, APEX Growth Unit, VEGGIE, adaptation, seedling growth, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionOn Earth, plants are exposed to a unidirectional 1-g force that guides the growth of their organs (gravitropism). Furthermore, the weight imposed by gravity on each organ results in a mechanical load that must be counteracted by thick, sturdy cell walls and specialized morphologies. Millions of years of evolution on Earth have assured the effectiveness of these gravitropic, gravi-resistance, and gravimorphogenesis processes, allowing plants to grow and develop properly, forming morphologies that effectively permit completion of their life cycle [1]. Spaceflight, on the other hand, imposes very different constraints on the plants, which they never encountered during their evolution on Earth.During spaceflight, the directional cue provided by gravity is insufficient to modulate gravitropism, gravi-resistance, and other directional cues within the environment. Therefore other tropisms have to take over and guide plant organ growth, including light, gradients in water, oxygen, temperature, ions, and chemicals [2,3]. Similarly, the weightlessness associated with microgravity exposure implies a lack of weight-bearing on plant organs, leading to different mechanical constraints on their growth behaviors [1,4]. Other critical alterations of the physical environment encountered by plants during spaceflight include a lack of gravity-induced convection resulting in diminished gas exchange at the surface of the plant, altered photosynthesis, respiration, hypoxia, and thermoregulation [1,2,5,6,7,8]. Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [9].Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named “space syndrome”. These include shorter organs, thinner leaves, roots tending to grow away from the light source (negative phototropism) while also skewing in some cases, root hairs of altered size, modified organelle size and shape, altered metabolism, and accumulation of starch, to cite only a few [10,11,12,13,14].Researchers have heavily relied on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to reveal key molecular pathways that are responsive to the spaceflight environment relative to ground controls. Experiments using mostlyArabidopsis thalianaseedlings or plant tissue cultures as experimental materials have revealed potential contributions of Ca2+, light and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, cell wall remodeling, and defense responses in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment [6,8,10,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Some of these expression changes were accompanied by alterations in the pattern of CNG and CNN DNA methylation in the proximity of the corresponding genes, suggesting some epigenetic contribution to the process [24]. Interestingly, a short root-hair phenotype displayed by Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the BRIC hardware onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) was accompanied by decreased expression of genes associated with oxidative stress (such as peroxidases) and cell wall remodeling, and reverse genetics demonstrated a contribution of some of these genes in modulation of root hair growth [14].The profiling investigations described above have revealed a large variability in expression responses between experiments due in part to differences in hardware used to grow the plants, growth conditions, and plant genotypes (reviewed in [25]). The latter parameter (plant genotype) is particularly interesting to consider. Indeed, the geographical origin of a specific plant accession plays a key role in defining the type of responses the plant will develop under specific environmental conditions, reflecting an important role for selective forces in dictating the evolution of adaptive traits. Consequently, for any plant species, individual ecotypes carry specific sets of alleles that allowed the plants to not only survive and adapt to the conditions of their native environment, but also result in distinct abilities to cope with new environments to which they might subsequently become exposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments attempting to evaluate Arabidopsis’s ability to adapt to the microgravity environment have revealed dramatic accession-specific differences in their ability to grow, develop, and respond molecularly to this novel environment.In fact, most experiments aimed at investigating Arabidopsis transcriptional responses to spaceflight have been carried out using the Col ecotype at the seedling stage [10,14,15,20,26] or as cell cultures [18,21]. Additionally, transcriptomic responses to spaceflight of Ler-0 and Ws ecotypes have been investigated in multiple space environments such as in Space Shuttles [8] and the International Space Station (ISS) [17,22], using a variety of hardware such as the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS: [10,15]) or the CARA experiment [16], respectively. More recently, a landmark paper described a more thorough comparative transcriptomic analysis of four Arabidopsis ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0) exposed to either microgravity conditions or 1-g [6]. Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that different accessions display both common and accession-specific responses to the microgravity environment relative to ground controls. Shared transcriptomic responses included the activation of expression of molecular chaperones that may protect the cells against oxidative damage imposed by the hypoxic conditions that typically develop around plant organs in the absence of convective buoyancy under microgravity [6].WhileArabidopsis thalianaserves as an outstanding genetic model for investigations of dicot plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight, most major agriculture crops grown on Earth for food, feed, and fiber are monocots, which diverged from the dicots ~150 million years ago [27]. Unfortunately, comparatively fewer experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of spaceflight on monocot plant growth, morphology, and expression profiles. The wheat PESTO experiment investigated the growth of semi-dwarf wheat plants (Triticum aestivumL. cv. USU Apo) onboard the ISS relative to 1-g ground controls, demonstrating the existence of morphological differences between these two groups, including thinner leaves with ovoid chloroplasts and greater packaging density for microgravity-exposed plants relative to ground controls [13]. Similar phenotypes were also displayed by microgravity-exposedZea maysplants [28]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativaL. cv. Koshihikari) grown for 68.5–136 h in the Space Shuttle STS-95 mission displayed longer roots than ground control, a phenotype associated with some thinning of the cell wall along with higher elasticity modulus and viscosity coefficient in space relative to ground controls [29].Shagimardanova and colleagues analyzed the effects of microgravity on the transcriptome of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants growing in the Lada root module onboard the ISS [30]. They observed substantial transcriptomic differences between spaceflight and ground-control seedlings, including genes preferentially associated with stress response, pathogenesis, and antioxidant pathways [30]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (Oryza sativaL.) germinated and grown in aScience in Microgravity Box(SIMBOX) biological incubator on board the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft displayed dramatically altered photosynthesis characteristics with decreased photosystem 1 (PS1) efficiency relative to ground controls. This phenotype was associated with decreased abundance of proteins associated with the PS1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH), and cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) complexes. Hence, spaceflight may lead to declines in PSI activity in rice, either as a direct consequence of microgravity, or caused by side effects of spaceflight associated with inefficient airflow, high CO2and ethylene levels, radiation, and/or other experimental parameters [31].In this paper, we present the results of an experiment named APEX-06 (Advanced Plant Experiment-06) aimed at investigating the effect of spaceflight on the growth, morphology, and transcriptome profiles ofBrachypodium distachyon, a genetic model for monocots closely related to cereal crops such as oat, wheat, barley, and rice [32]. We show that Brachypodium seedlings grown on the surface of foam substrates within modified Magenta-Box containers display accession-specific alterations in seedling organ growth onboard the ISS relative to ground controls. Surprisingly, exposure of Brachypodium to spaceflight conditions also triggered increased root-hair growth under our cultivation conditions, a phenotype that correlated with altered expression of key genes associated with ROS signaling and root-hair growth in one of the tested accessions. We also report dramatic differences in organ-specific transcriptomic responses to the spaceflight environment between Brachypodium accessions and discuss these observations within the context of monocot plant adaptation to spaceflight. Because a 1×gcentrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber utilized in these experiments, the growth and transcriptomic responses to spaceflight observed in this project may be the consequence of exposure to microgravity, radiation, or other spaceflight-associated parameters such as inefficient airflow and gas exchange, high ethylene levels, and/or other parameters."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nScientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation.\nHere we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of\nAltered response to gravity 1\n(\nArg1\n), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of\nArabidopsis thaliana\nderived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be\nArg1\n-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMost multicellular organismshave specialized organs, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedicated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensing columella cells found in the plant root tip (Satoet al.,2015). However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cells and organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity (Paulet al.,2012). Yet the fundamental question of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remains unanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth and provide unique experimental information about gravity-sensing mechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceflight (Reaet al.,2016; Vandenbrink and Kiss,2016). Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceflight advances fundamental knowledge about how cells recognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare for long-term space exploration.Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled organisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they are indeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by the spaceflight environment. In the microgravity of spaceflight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reflected in, differential gene expression when compared to living on the ground (Salmi and Roux,2008; Paulet al.,2012; Fengleret al.,2015). Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in microgravity (Paulet al.,2012; Fengleret al.,2015). Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the response of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to spaceflight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation to spaceflight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines ofArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plants deficient in a known gravity-sensing gene:Altered response to gravity 1(Arg1).Several reasons contributed to the selection ofArg1for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence thatArg1functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots (Sedbrooket al.,1998; Blancaflor,2013). During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efflux carrier proteins—such as PIN2 and PIN3—to the basal side of the statocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap (Abaset al.,2006; Harrison and Masson,2008b; Kleine-Vehnet al.,2010). Although this process has not been demonstrated in non-statocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Several additional characteristics madeArg1a particularly interesting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells.Arg1is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specific gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does not appear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typified by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism (Guanet al.,2003; Stangaet al.,2009; Morita and Nakamura,2012). Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 is localized throughout the endosomal/secretory pathway, enabling it to interact with both vesicular trafficking and integral membrane proteins (Boonsirichaiet al.,2003). ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Boonsirichaiet al.,2003; Stangaet al.,2009); thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conservedJdomain at ARG1's N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signal transduction (Caplanet al.,1993; Kimuraet al.,1995), also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. TheJ-domain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperones by interacting with HSC70 (Younget al.,2003), and the ARG1/HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role in protein transfer (Jouhet and Gray,2009; Su and Li,2010). HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceflight in several plant systems (reviewed in Schüleret al.,2015), including undifferentiated cells (Paulet al.,2012; Zupanskaet al.,2013), strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to aJdomain, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton (Sedbrooket al.,1999; Boonsirichaiet al.,2003; Harrison and Masson,2008a). The cytoskeleton is central to many models of single-cell gravity sensing (Ingber,1999; Vorselenet al.,2014), and actin has been specifically implicated in gravisensing (Kamadaet al.,2005; Kwonet al.,2015). Thus ARG1's extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undifferentiated cells.Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to comparable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceflight environment on these cells.The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight environment and, in particular, test the effect of removingArg1, a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utilization of this mutant also revealed genes important to spaceflight adaptation that would not normally be recognized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceflight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the level that is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceflight in WT cells. However, if the expression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WT levels to enable spaceflight adaptation. Thus the altered expression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceflight adaptation.The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1's role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specific, differentiated cells and organs for environmental sensing."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe complex networks and signalling pathways that equip plants to cope with environmental challenge developed over evolutionary time in terrestrial environments. Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs (Cowleset al.1984;Hosonet al.2002;Sogaet al.2002;Paulet al.2013a;Ferlet al.2014). Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response (Paulet al.2017), thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments.The physiological impact of spaceflight is reflected in the patterns of gene expression. Irrespective of plant growth hardware, duration in space or age of plants, one consensus is that spaceflight elicits responses from pathways associated with cell wall remodelling, cell polarity, phytohormone-mediated processes, as well as general stress responses, such as wounding, pathogen defence, heat shock and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Jooet al.2001;Paulet al.2005,2012b,2013a;Correllet al.2013;Zupanskaet al.2013;Ferlet al.2014;Mazarset al.2014;Sugimotoet al.2014;Zhanget al.2014;Kwonet al.2015;Schüleret al.2015). In addition, a large proportion of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight encode unknown proteins.Spaceflight-grownArabidopsisroots tend to be smaller, have fewer lateral roots and shorter root hair development than their terrestrial controls (Paulet al.2012a;Kwonet al.2015). Aspects of these morphologies in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) suggest a relationship between the down-regulation of several peroxidase genes in spaceflight (Kwonet al.2015).In this study, a spaceflight-induced gene of unknown function identified from roots was investigated for its potential involvement in ROS-related functions. AT1G05290, which we have dubbedOrbitally Manifested Gene 1(OMG1), was one of the highest significantly (P= 0.0005) induced genes in the Advanced Plant Experiment 01 (APEX01) spaceflight data set (fold change = 12) (Paulet al.2013a). Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks aroundOMG1show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathwaysObayashiet al. 2014.OMG1was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes (Shin and Schachtman 2004;Potockýet al.2007;Winteret al.2007;Lassiget al.2014). In addition,OMG1is an unrealized member of the CONSTANS-Like family of transcription factors. These findings, originating with the novel environment of spaceflight, further the understanding of plant growth and development and provide insight into the role of a heretofore unknown gene."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSurvival in a challenging environment requires a coordinated system that enables a living organism to respond appropriately to a change. The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants [1,2] and with specific assays of expression [3,4,5,6,7]. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments [8,9,10,11].Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Even unicellular plants are capable of sensing a change in the gravitational environment and there have been several spaceflight experiments that examine the transcriptomes of single plant cells, and undifferentiated plants cells, which also lack traditional gravity-sensing organs [4,19,25,26,27,28]. The wealth of information on the transcriptional changes that accompany the adjustments to spaceflight begins to suggest common strategies for adjusting to the spaceflight environment; however, the underlying question of why certain genes are necessary remains unanswered. One group of genes strongly represented in many spaceflight transcriptomes is composed of the heat shock transcription factors and proteins that comprise the Heat Shock Factor network [15,19].Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes in response to almost any environmental stress and are essential to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms (for review, please see [29]). HSF genes are evolutionarily conserved and are represented in the genomes of almost every organism. Given the conservation of the HSF network and its general roles in stress responses, it was perhaps not surprising to see HSFs represented in the response to spaceflight in plants. Their particularly strong representation in cell cultures; however, suggested HSFs could play a unique role in the spaceflight response of undifferentiated cells [4].One hallmark of cellular stress is the accumulation of denatured proteins. The main gene targets of HSF-induced transcriptional activation are the stress response proteins that act as molecular chaperones [29,30,31,32]. These chaperones not only protect a cell from denatured protein accumulation, but also assure proper protein folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins indispensable in response to stress. The Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the main chaperones of the folding machinery, but there are also other non-chaperone proteins assisting in efficient protein maturation [33,34,35]. For instance, a pair of enzymes, including a disulfide carrier protein (protein disulfide isomerase, PDI), and a disulfide-generating enzyme (endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1, ERO1 and protein disulfide isomerase, PDI, PDIs/ERO1) catalyze oxidative protein folding by creating disulfide bonds, thereby assisting in proper protein sorting [36,37].Protein folding occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also serves as the main hub for the secretory pathways and protein delivery to their final destinations. The ER uses an extensive surveillance called the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) system, which assures that only properly folded proteins exit the ER and maintains proper physiological homeostasis in the ER [38]. When there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a stress signal is emitted. Initially, a cell activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) intended to increase the ER folding capacity in an attempt to refold the aberrant proteins [39,40]. If these UPR solutions to the unfolded protein accumulation problem fail, or if the accumulation of misfolded proteins is massive, then the final UPR step—the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)—is activated. The ERAD eliminates and destroys the misfolded proteins via proteasome digestion, preventing further protein aggregation. The luminal lectin OS9 in cooperation with a membrane spanning protein SEL1/HRD3 recognizes the unfolded glycosylated proteins which are then ubiquitinylated by the HRD1 E3 ligase, removed from the ER lumen, and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytoplasm [41,42]. Taken collectively, ER homeostasis works as a sensor for environmental stimuli, and the ER stress signal initiates a subcellular stress response system that can secure protein homeostasis during environmental changes [43,44].TheHsfA2gene is a member of the large family ofHsfgenes in the HSF network and is a key regulator of the defense response via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation to several types of environmental stresses, namely extreme temperatures (high and low), hydrogen peroxide, and high light intensity [45,46,47]. The HSFA2 protein has been demonstrated itself to be the main coordinator of the UPR during heat stress [48]. The critical involvement of HSFA2 in the response to extreme environments makes it an excellent target candidate for studying the effects of spaceflight on plants and to test if plants use the same universal stress response mechanism evolved terrestrially to accommodate the novel space gravitational environment.HSFA2 may also have an additional role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment beyond the UPR induction of the chaperone-based protein folding machinery. The genes encoding HSFs and HSPs were reported to be upregulated in spaceflight in many biological systems [26,49]. TheHsfA2gene specifically was the highest upregulated gene in the wild typeArabidopsiscell cultures after 12 days in space [4,19]. Moreover, HSFA2 was shown to function in amplification of the signal in response to brassinosteroids, calcium, and auxin and was reported to be affected inArabidopsisin spaceflight, and therefore has the potential for playing a role in the gravity sensing signal transduction cascade [13,20,50]. In the unicellular yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the HSF targets represent nearly 3% of the genome and the diversity of their functions supports a broad role for HSF in coordinating the multitude of cellular processes occurring in normal and stressful conditions [51]. Since the HSFs play a role in various cellular processes such as development, cellular lifespan, cell differentiation and proliferation, the likelihood that HSFA2 will play some role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight increases [52,53].Cell lines from wild type (WT) Col-0 and anHsfA2knockout (HSFA2 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Cannisters 17 (BRIC17) payload. The experiments here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to samples grown on the ground. Descriptions and discussions will consider not only the spaceflight adaptation experience for each genotype, but also the gene expression profiles in the ground and spaceflight environments between genotypes. It was our goal to develop a better understanding of how cells, disabled in a primary regulator of environmental stress response, react to an unfamiliar environment outside of their evolutionary experience. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding not only of HSFA2’s role in adjusting to novel environments, but also the broader scope of the processes involved spaceflight physiological adaptation in plant cells."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.\nKeywords:\nneutrophils, spaceflight, simulated microgravity, NLR, inflammation, oxidative stress response",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight can pose novel challenges to the health of astronauts. For instance, physiological aging occurs significantly faster as a result of spaceflight, when measured by muscle wasting, loss of bone density, and immune dysfunction (1,2). Processes regulated by redox imbalance may contribute to these adverse outcomes (3–9). Redox imbalance results from a disproportionate increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria (10) compared to antioxidants in the cell. Elevated ROS is also a product of the oxidative burst response of neutrophils (11). In response to stimuli, terminally differentiated neutrophils in circulation become activated and engage the oxidative burst response, producing inflammatory mediators (11). If left unchecked, elevated ROS can cause cellular damage that potentiates inflammation both on Earth and during spaceflight (4,12). Therefore, it is necessary to maintain tight regulation of the oxidative burst response to limit inflammation (13) and regulate immunity during prolonged spaceflight.Neutrophils are granulocytes that constitute approximately 50–70% of the total leukocyte population in humans. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection or injury and are typically short-lived in blood circulation under homeostatic conditions (14,15). Lymphocytes are an important group of white blood cells involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. They constitute 20–50% of total leukocytes in circulation and consist of natural killer, natural killer T cells, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and B cells (16,17). On Earth, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a useful biomarker to measure subclinical inflammation in humans (18). Chronic, persistent inflammation can be a major pre-existing cause of disease development (19,20) and can be monitored by the expression of blood-based biomarkers. For example, elevated NLR predicts poor prognosis in some cancers (21–24), positively correlates with age (25), and reflects chronic stress in mice (26). Although, elevated human NLR (>3.53) (27) has been implicated in clinical settings to identify heightened inflammation (18), this biomarker has not yet been recognized for spaceflight-induced inflammation. Spaceflight raises circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts, primarily granulocytes, may reduce lymphocyte counts (12,28,29), and impairs immune cell functions (6,12,30,31). Although, the spaceflight environment elevates circulating blood granulocytes counts in astronauts (29), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Currently, there are no well-established biomarkers for astronauts on long-duration, deep space missions, where medical intervention will be limited. Thus, identifying biomarkers to monitor in-flight astronaut health and developing countermeasures that reverse these adverse outcomes are necessary for successful future missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Therefore, we propose that an elevated NLR may be a useful prognostic indicator or diagnostic biomarker to assess astronaut immune status during long-duration missions.To test this, we analyzed both spaceflight-treated, and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated, samples to determine if NLR was elevated. Analyses of complete blood count (CBC) leukocyte differentials revealed spaceflight caused a progressive increase of granulocyte-to-lymphocyte (GLR) in astronauts and NLR in rodents. To simulate microgravity using established methods, human leukocytes were cultured in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV)in vitroand mice were hindlimb unloaded (HU)in vivo(32,33). HARV-RWV is a bioreactor allowing 3D-spatial freedom for cells and can model microgravity. It has two unique aspects similar to the spaceflight-associated microgravity environment, (1) a state of constant suspension, and (2) a quiescent surrounding without any shear or turbulent forces. Previous studies have determined leukocyte responses utilizing HARV-RWV produce similar responses as leukocytes cultured post-landing orex vivoin flight (34–42). Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a ground-based model mimicking spaceflight-associated microgravity in rodents. The hindlimbs of rodents are elevated to produce 30–40 degree head-down tilt, inducing a cephalad fluid shift and preventing weightbearing of hindlimbs (43). The HU model can lead to immune, bone, and musculoskeletal alterations, some of which have also been observed in International Space Station (ISS) crew (44,45). In our study, functional outputs of neutrophils in response to simulated microgravity (sµg) revealed elevated ROS and proinflammatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in activated neutrophils. Interestingly, this effect could be mitigated with antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, sµg HUwildtype(Wt) mice displayed elevated neutrophils, NLR and marginal inflammation, which was dampened in mitochondrial catalase (mCAT) transgenic mice, known to show reduced oxidative stress responses. Our findings demonstrated that, albeit distinct mechanisms, both sµg models (in vitroHARV-RWV andin vivoHU), displayed elevated oxidative stress and NLR, that could be mitigated by antioxidants. Therefore, modifying mechanisms involved in ROS-driven inflammation (46) may provide a promising avenue to limit chronic inflammation and maintain homeostatic immunity during long-duration missions."

        "Abstract": "Graphical Abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRecent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inflammation, elevated granulocytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015;Douda et al., 2015;Leliefeld et al., 2016;Martinez et al., 2015;Mehta et al., 2017;Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less is known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration.Solar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation are charged particle ionizing types of radiation that will impact humans and spacecraft during lunar and deep spaceflight missions (Sridharan et al., 2020). High doses of these types of charged ionizing radiation types do not typically pose a threat to Earth, as we are shielded by the Earth's magnetosphere (Simonsen et al., 2020); however, astronauts on future missions to the lunar surface and Mars will have limited shielding from these damaging irradiation. Although doses experienced in deep space do not parallel those of LEO manned missions, health risks associated with LEO doses are still considerable. For instance, current missions in LEO, such as on the ISS, experience a low total absorbed dose of irradiation, estimated to be exposed to approximately 0.10–0.52 mGy/day, depending on the mission, as quantified by NASA GeneLab's environmental data for spaceflight experiments (Miller, 2020).SPE irradiation originates from protons being emitted during solar flares and coronal mass ejections (Narici et al., 2018;Sanzari et al., 2015), and although the majority of the ions are protons at different energies during these events, it can also include other ions such as helium and high- (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions (Hu, 2017). Limited number of human reports following SPE irradiation exposure are associated with astronauts on LEO spacewalks and lunar missions from the Apollo era (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013). The physiological effects of SPE irradiation exposure include fatigue, acute radiation sickness, long-term skin damage, elevated cytokine storms, and decreased blood and hemopoietic cell numbers (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013).GCR irradiation is emitted from the sun, stars, and energetic objects such as supernova (Nelson, 2016) and consists of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and high-energy high-charge (HZE) ions with intrinsic masses (for example, iron, silicon, oxygen, and carbon) (Nelson, 2016). As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence of SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day (Miller, 2020), astronauts in LEO could therefore be exposed up to a roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an extremely high dose of protons (Hu, 2017) possibly up to 1 Gy or more (Wu et al., 2009), which would pose significant health risks. NASA estimates that the amount of GCR irradiation exposure during deep space missions may be 0.3–0.6 mGy/day or more over a 3-year-long mission to Mars (0.245–0.360 Gy) (Nelson, 2016).Linear energy transfer (LET) is defined as the amount of energy that is deposited or transferred in a material from an ion (Chancellor et al., 2018). High-LET irradiation can cause more damaging ionizing tracks and pose a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) risk compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). However, this does not rule out the composite effects of low-LET continuous dose/dose rate involved during spaceflight (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018;Saha et al., 2014), the effects of low LET inhibition of angiogenesis (Grabham et al., 2013), or the range of cellular damage by low-LET particles (Nelson, 2016). RBE is the relative amount of biological damage a dose of irradiation will have on tissue (Chancellor et al., 2018). Thus, identifying the immune responses following distinct ionizing irradiation types, along with described dosing schemes, RBEs, and protracted exposures, are essential for future exploration missions to the lunar surface and Mars.Due to limitations of performing deep space missions, there have been multiple ground-based research studies examining the effects of ionizing irradiation on immunity. For instance, large disparities in immune population subtypes, in particular lymphocytes (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2017;Gridley and Pecaut, 2011;Gridley et al., 2002;Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013) and induction of inflammation (Baselet et al., 2019;Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Li et al., 2014;Teresa Pinto et al., 2016), have been reported. However, more information is required on the deep space-relevant spectra of irradiation effects on immunity.With recent advancements in simulated GCR and SPE dosing schemes at NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) within Brookhaven National Laboratory, the biological effects of realistic deep space exposures can now be successfully measured in ground-based studies (Simonsen et al., 2020). Therefore, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HU) in mice. We hypothesized that unique immune signatures and microRNA (miRNA) profiles would be produced by distinct experimental conditions of simulated GCR, SPE, and gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU. Although this study focuses on immune dysregulation during deep spaceflight, the knowledge gained from these studies can be applied to related issues on Earth such as, cancer radiotherapy, muscle degeneration, and immune-related diseases."

Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.\nSubject terms:\nGene regulation in immune cells, Immunology, Biomarkers, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Gene regulatory networks",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWhile the majority of spaceflight studies focus on the physiological responses during or immediately after flight, readaptation to nominal gravitational environments is also an important factor in astronaut health. This is particularly important for future exploratory missions to the Moon (0.166 g) or Mars (0.38 g) involving long-duration exposures to microgravity (0 g) and elevated doses of ionizing irradiation. Both the adaptation to spaceflight, and the readaptation to planetary gravitational environments, involve multiple physiological systems. Currently, short and the long-term consequences of prolonged exposure to deep spaceflight environments are largely unknown.There are several consequences to living in low-Earth orbit. These include edema due to fluid and cardiovascular deconditioning1, myelin degeneration2, disorientation and motor control deficits3,4, visual deficits5, endocrine and hormonal alterations6, muscle tone wasting7, and bone loss due to lack of mechanical loading8. Upon return to Earth, there is a period of readaptation that includes acute motion sickness, unsteadiness, imbalance due to gravity-induced vestibular fluid shifts9, and blood pressure changes10–12. Most notably, space anemia13,14was re-classified as post-flight anemia, because of inconsistencies reported in key hematological parameters, including red blood cell (RBC) counts and mean corpuscular volumes (MPV). This was attributed to the timing of blood sample collections occurring at post-flight return versus in-flight retrieval10,14,15. Mission duration can also affect post-flight recovery, whereby longer missions result in prolonged recovery post-mission16. This becomes an important risk factor to consider for exploratory missions to Mars. Indeed, understanding how immune and hematological cells compensate in response to the changing gravitational environment becomes particularly important as crew currently rehabilitate to Earth’s gravity for multiple months post-flight17. Yet, this timeframe may be problematic on planetary bodies with reduced gravity. Therefore, a better understanding of blood differentials and their transcriptional regulatory patterns are essential for successful development of countermeasures to be used on future exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars.Ground-based models of spaceflight are developed to easily explore the impacts of the spaceflight environment on physiology. Indeed, we previously reported that a 21-day, protracted exposure of 0.04 Gy low dose/low dose rate gamma radiation (LDR), combined with hindlimb unloading (HLU), can have neurological impacts on blood–brain barrier integrity, the oxidative stress response, and neuroplasticity18–22. Here, we expand on this work, using RNA-sequencing of splenic tissues and complete blood cell (CBC) counts to characterize relevant immune and hematological pathways engaged after 1-week readaptation following simulated spaceflight conditions."

        "Title": "Epigenomic regulators elongator complex subunit 2 and methyltransferase 1 differentially condition the spaceflight response in Arabidopsis",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground:\nPlants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (\nmet1-7)\nand elongator complex subunit 2 (\nelp2-5\n)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.\nResults:\nThe\nelp2-5\nplants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The\nmet1-7\nplants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the\nelp2-5\nand\nmet1-7\nplants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in\nelp2-5\n. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of\nmet1-7\nand\nelp2-5\neach presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in\nelp2-5\n.\nConclusion:\nArabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet\nmet1-7\nreprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of\nelp2-5\nresults in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight adaptation, DNA methylation, epigenetic, space biology, microgravity, elongator complex subunit 2, methyltransferase 1, methylation mutants",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPlants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g.,Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010;Sewelam et al., 2014;Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g.,Dowen et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2018). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment.DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in:Bartels et al., 2018). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g.,Labra et al., 2002;Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010;Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011;Bilichak et al., 2012;Colaneri and Jones, 2013;Tricker et al., 2013;Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015,2016;Hewezi et al., 2017,2018;Bartels et al., 2018;Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018;Beyrne et al., 2019;Ashapkin et al., 2020;Akhter et al., 2021;Korotko et al., 2021;Laanen et al., 2021;Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling (Hoson et al., 2002;Gao et al., 2008;Salmi and Roux, 2008;Blancaflor, 2013;Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013;Zupanska et al., 2013;Ferl et al., 2014;Inglis et al., 2014;Nakashima et al., 2014;Sugimoto et al., 2014;Kwon et al., 2015;Schüler et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2015;Ferl and Paul, 2016;Herranz et al., 2019;Vandenbrink et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020;Califar et al., 2020;Kruse et al., 2020;Angelos et al., 2021;Manian et al., 2021b). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (Xu et al., 2018). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs;Zhou et al., 2019).The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs;Zhou et al., 2019). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments (Huang et al., 2019). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response (Dowen et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2013;Yu et al., 2013;Tameshige et al., 2015;Jarosz et al., 2020). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight (Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013,2017;Sugimoto et al., 2014;Kwon et al., 2015;Schüler et al., 2015;Herranz et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020;Califar et al., 2020;Manian et al., 2021a). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight?DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context (Chevalier et al., 2005;Hsieh et al., 2012;Pikaard, 2013). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directde novoDNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V (Matzke et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts (Zhong et al., 2014). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases.The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites (Kankel et al., 2003;Rigal et al., 2016). MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses (Naydenov et al., 2015;Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015;Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020). The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes (Saze et al., 2003). Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections (Kankel et al., 2003;Dowen et al., 2012). Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutantmet1-3lines (Supplementary Material,Dowen et al., 2012) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019) including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis (Dowen et al., 2012;Zhang, 2012), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1.The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Nelissen et al., 2005;Glatt and Muller, 2013;Ding and Mou, 2015;Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function (Ding and Mou, 2015) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g.,Glatt and Muller, 2013;Jarosz et al., 2020). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response (Woloszynska et al., 2016). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g.,Xie and Yu, 2015), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in:Jarosz et al., 2020).ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,Wang et al., 2013) and plays a role in root development (e.g.,Jia et al., 2015), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation (DeFraia et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2013;Silva et al., 2017). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription (DeFraia et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2013;Silva et al., 2017), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development (Jia et al., 2015) and auxin signaling (Nelissen et al., 2010). Many of the genes differentially expressed betweenelp2mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses (Zhou et al., 2009). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed inelp2mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g.,Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants.The Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EPEX) spaceflight experiment reported herein investigated the contribution of epigenomic changes in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, specifically the role of cytosine DNA methylation in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis. The experiment was conducted onboard the ISS to evaluate the spaceflight responses of the methylation mutantsmet1-7andelp2-5compared to the Col-0 wild-type background of both mutant lines. Growth patterns, genome-wide methylation profiles, and differential gene expression profiles were used to develop an integrated assessment of the interplay of DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation in the response to spaceflight."

        "Title": "Plants grown in Apollo lunar regolith present stress-associated transcriptomes that inform prospects for lunar exploration",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant\nArabidopsis thaliana\ngerminates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.\nSubject terms:\nAbiotic, Transcriptomics, Plant molecular biology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe return of humans to the Moon during the NASA Artemis program1has elevated scientific interest in the lunar environment and its impact on terrestrial biology2,3. Since the return to the Moon is envisioned as a dedicated, longer-term commitment to lunar exploration, questions of the lunar environmental impact on biology and biological systems have become a significant part of the lunar exploration agenda. Plants have long been envisioned as part of lunar habitats4–8and exploration environments9,10. However, until the current study, the interactions between lunar materials and terrestrial biology were unaddressed in the era of modern molecular biology, and there had yet to be any experiments where plants were actually grown in the true lunar regolith. Understanding the impact of sustained exposure of terrestrial biology to lunar regolith, and determining the efficacy of lunar regolith as a viable in situ resource, is important to the concept of returning to the Moon for long durations. Therefore, we used plant growth and gene expression (e.g.,11–13) to both tests the fundamental impact of lunar regolith on terrestrial biology, and provide an initial evaluation of regolith as a matrix for plant growth systems in lunar exploration habitats.Plants are key components of the biological sciences within and in support of space exploration. As model organisms, plants provide insights into gravity, radiation, and other space-related biological phenomena, and therefore help drive an understanding of the physiological adaptation of terrestrial biology to space exploration environments. There is an expanding wealth of literature documenting this progress, e.g.,11,14–19. Plants also make available potentially essential components to the long-term habitation of space and extraterrestrial surfaces by providing food and oxygen, recycling water, and scrubbing carbon dioxide from human habitats. However, many designs of extraterrestrial plant growth systems largely rely on hydroponic systems20,21, in part due to the lack of information on the efficacy of using in situ materials, such as planetary regolith, as a growth substrate. Information on plant growth in lunar regolith, therefore, informs fundamental biology interactions within the lunar environment, and helps scale options for the use of plants in lunar life support scenarios.The Apollo Moon landings were a critical point in the science of space exploration, not only in the accomplishment of lunar visits, but also in that terrestrial biology would be in contact with extraterrestrial material, and samples of that material would be intentionally returned to Earth. The first contact between terrestrial biology and lunar regolith was an unprecedented concern for protecting both the astronauts visiting the Moon as well as the entire Earth biosphere from the potentially harmful effects of returned lunar materials. Novel, extraterrestrial pathogenic microorganisms were the main concern, in addition to toxic mineral compositions and abrasive physical characteristics. To protect the returning human explorers and the terrestrial biosphere, the astronauts and attending medical staff were isolated for 2 weeks upon the return of the early Apollo crews (e.g.,22). In addition, lunar samples were intensively isolated in specialized facilities at the Johnson Space Center Lunar Receiving Laboratory23,24, where the samples were handled in gloveboxes roughly equivalent to current high-level biological containment. The primary goal was to search for pathogens, and those search procedures relied on direct, though largely transient contact between lunar materials and biology. In the specific case of plants, lunar samples were rubbed onto leaf surfaces and sprinkled onto seedlings and growth media25, but plants were never grown in lunar regolith as the support matrix25–27. This gap in knowledge is addressed in the following experiment.We asked the two-tiered question of whether plants can develop successfully in lunar regolith, and if so, what metabolic strategies, as suggested by differential transcriptomes, were utilized to physiologically adapt to growth in this novel environment. Arabidopsis was seeded directly onto samples from Apollo 11 (10084), 12 (12070), and 17 (70051) (Fig.1a), which represent diverse regolith types. The Apollo 11 and 12 samples are mature and submature regoliths, respectively, due to their relatively long exposure to the lunar surface, whereas the Apollo 17 sample is an immature, shorter surface exposure regolith mixture from multiple areas at the Apollo 17 site28–31. All are from areas of the Moon dominated by basaltic mineralogy28–31. The lunar simulant JSC-1A29,32,33was used for the terrestrial control material. All lunar regolith samples, as well as the JSC-1A simulant used for controls, were samples sieved to <1 mm particle size.Fig. 1. Lunar regolith sources and experiment set up.Open in a new tabaA summary table of lunar sample sources50.bWe used four replicate plates, each 48-well cell culture plate contained four wells of JSC-1A simulant and three of lunar regolith (one well each per plate) – Apollo 11 (A11), Apollo 12 (A12), Apollo 17 (A17).cEach well contained 900 mg of regolith material layered over a 0.45-micron filter and Rockwool wick and was sown with 3-5 Arabidopsis seeds suspended in water (also Supplementary Fig.1). Lunar In Situ images are publicly available from NASA archives.There area few notable mineralogical and compositional differences between the lunar regoliths and JSC-1A. The lunar samples used here contain 30–52 vol. % agglutinates, which are aggregates containing mineral fragments, nanophase metallic Fe, trapped gases, and glass that form due to micrometeorite impacts28,29. Agglutinate and nanophase Fe abundance both increases with regolith maturity as prolonged surface exposure to the solar wind reduces particle size, the increases the conversion rate of grains of Fe metal to nanophase Fe28,29. Many regolith simulants such as JSC-1A contain abundant natural volcanic glass, e.g.,29, but this material does not fully replicate agglutinate assemblages or morphologies. Additionally, the overall Fe oxidation state of the lunar samples differs from that of JSC-1A. Although to our knowledge, Fe oxidation state ratios have not been quantified in these samples, lunar regolith ubiquitously contains nanophase metallic Fe (partially within agglutinates) in addition to solely Fe2+in mafic silicates and oxides34, whereas JSC-1A is known to contain Fe3+-bearing Fe-Ti oxides (namely magnetite and chromite) in addition to some proportion of Fe3+in its silicates and glass. Lastly, two of the lunar regoliths (10084 and 70051) are derived from high-Ti basaltic bedrock and have TiO2abundances of 5–7 wt.%, which is considerably higher than that of JSC-1A at 1.85 wt.%, e.g.,29."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionExploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020;Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Grimm et al., 2016;Indo et al., 2016;Kononikhin et al., 2017;Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018;Clément et al., 2020,Salim, 2017,Friedman, 2011).Spanning over 60 years of research, the short-term impacts of spaceflight on the CNS have been investigated, but there is still insufficient data regarding its long-term health risks (Clément et al., 2020). Also, there are limitations to evaluating the impact of CNS damage in humans. Therefore, there is a need to leverage research approaches using animal models that would aid in cellular, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of CNS responses to spaceflight. Recent literature has established the fruit fly as a valuable model for understanding the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and radiation in the spaceflight environment (Hateley et al., 2016;Hosamani et al., 2016;Ikenaga et al., 1997;Marcu et al., 2011;Ogneva et al., 2016). With their small size, short generation time (~10 days), short lifespan (~60-80 days), large number of offspring, and low cost of rearing, flies mitigate many of the practical concerns stemming from performing long term, multigenerational studies in space.Here, we present the results of an International Space Station (ISS)-based study, MVPFly-01(Multi-useVariable-gravityPlatform), to understand the effects of spaceflight on the fly nervous system and the value of artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure. AG is an attractive countermeasure, since it can potentially ameliorate the effect of microgravity (μg) on multiple physiological systems, by simulating Earth-like gravity (Clément, 2017;Clément and Traon, 2004;Horie et al., 2019;Shiba et al., 2017;Young, 1999). We performed behavioral analyses, brain immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and transcriptomics on flies subjected to microgravity (SFμg), inflight artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g), and environmentally matched ground control (Earth). Our results showed inflight and postflight behavioral changes and morphological alterations in the brain immediately postflight in response to μg. Further, acclimation to Earth following spaceflight revealed brain morphological changes in both SF1g and SFμg flies, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg. These results, in combination with metabolic pathways altered in transcriptomic and proteomic studies on fly heads frozen on the ISS provide comprehensive information on the effects of inflight AG exposure on CNS and postflight acclimation to Earth conditions."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSuborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.\nKeywords:\nsuborbital space, KSC fixation tubes, RNA-seq, arabidopsis, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe commercial suborbital spaceflight industry enables customers to reach the cusp of space and experience microgravity for several minutes before returning to Earth. The two main companies at the forefront of suborbital space efforts are Blue Origin (BO) and Virgin Galactic (VG). The two companies use different vehicles for their suborbital launches. Blue Origin flies New Shepard, a vertical rocket with a Crew Capsule. Virgin Galactic flies SpaceShipTwo, a rocket plane that is carried to high altitude before being dropped for launch. As such, the two providers present different modes of operations, different customer experiences and different flight profiles. Common features of both suborbital providers are a high g launch, minutes of microgravity conditions, followed by a high g re-entry. Although, the providers have different flight and gravity profiles, they both enable approximately three minutes of unmitigated microgravity [1,2]. It is those minutes of microgravity that are of high interest to science.From a biological researcher’s perspective, three minutes of high-quality microgravity opens the possibility to conduct a myriad of experiments—including but not limited to testing hardware capability, validating hypothesis, and understanding biological responses of not only microgravity, but the entirety of the spaceflight profile. Even though providers currently offer researchers an opportunity to send payloads on suborbital flight, there are severe limitations in that the untended experiment payloads are required to be contained in a locker, under fully autonomously controlled without the ability of the scientist to monitor and adjust for unforeseen situations. Thus, human suborbital spaceflight provides a promising complementary opportunity for researchers to conduct human-tended microgravity-related experiments using human capabilities that can better recapitulate a laboratory bench experiment than can an automated locker payload. Sampling biological responses at various phases of flight for subsequent analysis would be a natural initial experiment to understand biology responses to suborbital space.Plants being sessile in nature have evolved mechanisms to rapidly respond to their environment. Early transcriptomic responses have been investigated in response to various stresses such as; oxidative stress, heat stress, pathogen attack, and water stress [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Suborbital flights allow for the investigation of how plants quickly respond to transitions in varying gravity forces. To conduct such an experiment, there are several parameters that need to be considered. The rapid transitions into and out of microgravity occur within minutes, thus there is limited time for sample preparations and fixation. Plants should be poised and ready in a medium that confers as little confounding stresses as possible and upon exposure to the changes in gravity, and then be easily and rapidly preserved for proper biochemical analysis. Samples and fixatives should be triple contained and compact in size so that the hardware can be easily stowed during the flight. In addition, the acts of human tended fixation of the samples should be able to be completed rapidly.This paper describes a ground-based experiment setup that was developed to meet the needs for conducting a human tended plant biology experiments in a suborbital flight. This method highlights the expanded use of KSC Fixation Tubes as both houses for biology and for the subsequent fixation of that biology. The paper also discusses best practices for both experiment setup and conducting a RNAseq analysis to reliably report on the transcriptome of plant samples at various stages of a suborbital flight profile."

The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4\n+\npopulation but increased CD4\n+\nCD25\n+\ncells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c\n+\npopulation in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSince the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infections during and post-spaceflight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceflight [1], and astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections [2,3]. Published reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals [4–9]. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune function of viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value [10,11]. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine [5,7,12,13]. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards high levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding viral particles [4].Studies on spaceflight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space flown mice and rats, andin vitrocell culture systems [14]. Several changes in cell populations have been noted immediately post-spaceflight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-cells (specifically CD4+T-cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells [15–17]. However, reports of alterations in circulating leukocytes populations isolated from astronauts post-spaceflight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no changes in lymphocyte or monocytes populations [10,18–21]. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to mission specific variables and individual health status.The observed changes in immune activity post-spaceflight involves both innate (macrophages and NK cells) and adaptive (T-cell) functions. This report represents the first occasion of a detailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions, this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of spaceflight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic final flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLR), the surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using agonists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist), lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation parameters included T-cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-cell receptor) and CD28 (T-cell co-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor.Analysis of mouse splenocytes focused on changes in surface marker expression for T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I and II) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact with DCs, CD8+(MHC I) or CD4+(MHC II) T-cells are activated by antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the influence of spaceflight on immune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell hypersensitive activity."

After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe final US Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, launched on July 8, 2011. After 12 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes, Space ShuttleAtlantislanded safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. One of the many experiments flown on this historic flight to the International Space Station (ISS) was BioServe Space Technology’s Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3). Sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the last animal flight of the shuttle era was intended to test the impact of their proprietary pharmaceutical agent on spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal atrophy. Participants in the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) were given the opportunity to analyze a subset of the placebo-treated mice (n = 5–10, depending on the assay and tissue) as long as it did not interfere with the primary science. Our research team at Loma Linda University (LLU) has participated in all three Amgen/CBTM flights (STS-108, -118, and -135) [1–6], giving us the unique opportunity to both repeat and expand on previous results.There are at least three, currently unavoidable components of the spaceflight environment that directly impact immune function. These include changes in the inertial environment (e.g. launch and landing loads, microgravity), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (e.g. solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays, and the Van Allen belts), and physiological/psychological stress (e.g. unloading, work-related stress). Ground-based studies have shown that each of these environmental factors alone can have an impact on immune function.Previously, we and others have shown that the spaceflight environment can have a dramatic influence on immunity. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight [2,4]. Studies in both animal models and humans have shown that the spaceflight environment can influence total body, thymus and spleen mass [7–18], lymphocyte population distributions [18–25] and circulating corticosterone levels [16,17,26–33].Interestingly, spaceflight is also known to alter energy/lipid metabolism [34,35] and ground-based studies suggest that the stress marker, corticosterone/cortisol, plays a significant role [36]. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissues to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis [36]. As we demonstrate, metabolomic analysis of the liver indicates that glycerol was more abundant in flight mice relative to ground controls. Furthermore, data from the liver, skin and adrenal gland suggest that spaceflight caused a significant increase in corticosterone levels system-wide.These seemingly unrelated lines of investigation are important because there is a growing body of work describing the interaction between innate immunity and lipid metabolism (S1 Fig). Chronic inflammation is now accepted as a critical component in many pathologies and chronic diseases. Macrophages are not only among the first responders in host resistance to infection, but also have an underappreciated role in host health when metabolic changes occur [37]. For example, in obese people, increased numbers of liver and adipose tissue macrophages correlate with the development of metabolic syndrome [38].In the current study we describe a more systemic response to microgravity by combining traditional measures of innate immune function (population distributions, oxidative burst capacity, phagocytosis) and stress responses (adrenal catecholamine and corticosterone levels) with ‘omics techniques (metabolomics and transcriptomics). We believe that, for the first time, we can begin to show the links between spaceflight-dependent immune dysfunction and changes in metabolism."

        "Title": "Spaceflight Activates Autophagy Programs and the Proteasome in Mouse Liver",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIncreased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight, autophagy, proteasome, metabolomics, tRNA biosynthesis, senescence",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionLong-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13].Excessive ROS production, without a corresponding upregulation in antioxidant or ROS scavenger pathways, can cause damage to cellular components including DNA, proteins and lipids, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway [14]. This can lead to cell cycle arrest, activation of senescence or apoptosis and upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules, causing widespread organelle, cell and tissue damage [15]. Under conditions of chronic exposure to oxidative stress (such as in spaceflight), an imbalance occurs between ROS production and antioxidant quenching resulting in increased cellular and tissue damage [16,17,18]. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to damage by excess ROS and we hypothesized that the liver, a mitochondria-rich metabolic organ, may be a target of spaceflight-induced deficits. In support of this hypothesis, astronauts were shown to exhibit a mild diabetogenic phenotype following spaceflight, the severity of which was linked with flight duration [19,20].We previously demonstrated that mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (Space Transportation System (STS)-135) for 13.5 days exhibited a significantly impaired response to oxidative stress evidenced by decreased hepatic levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH, reduced), with concomitant increased ophthalmate, a biomarker for depletion of glutathione, and increased ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG):GSH [21]. Other spaceflight-induced changes in hepatic genes linked to oxidative defense have also been observed [13]. Our targeted analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets obtained from livers of spaceflight mice showed dysregulation of pathways involved in both lipid metabolism and the immune response, with signs of retinoid export and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathways suggestive of nascent hepatic fat accretion and collagen deposition. Proteomics data acquired from mice exposed to space for 30 days exhibited similar patterns when compared with mice re-acclimated to ground conditions [22].Our previous integrated data analysis utilized a limited set of genes and metabolites that were elevated in abundance in spaceflight mice as compared with ground controls and were tightly correlated with histological evidence of increased hepatic lipid accumulation. The goal of the present study was to perform unbiased, integrated analyses using the entire metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets to determine whether additional insights into the effects of exposure to the space environment on liver metabolism and cellular function could be gleaned. Utilizing several enrichment algorithms, we determined that degradation and senescence programs were altered in spaceflight mice in concert with attenuation of oxidative defense networks."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionLong-term deep space missions expose astronauts to an environment that is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during and after the course of mission activities. The hazards posed to normal tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), are not fully understood. The health risks of spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential neurodegenerative effects have long been a concern. Brain damage and degeneration can be promoted by many factors including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure.There is some evidence that low-dose, space-relevant radiation induces changes in neuronal functions [1]. Microgravity induces intraocular pressure and vascular changes [2,3] and promotes apoptosis of astrocytes [4]. Spaceflight also induces cognitive and perceptual motor performance deterioration under stress [5]. Studies have shown that exposure to spaceflights has a strong impact on metabolic and stress response [6]. Collective evidence indicates that exposure to stressful spaceflight environments might induce changes in brain neuronal structure and function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and role of cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those stemming from the spaceflight environment, in facilitating brain damage and neurodegeneration have been studied less and remain unclear.Gray matter consists of neurons (i.e., it contains the cell bodies, dendrites and axon terminals of neurons), nerve fibers, astrocytes, microglia, and capillaries. Gray matter is closely associated with the functional domains of performance, locomotion, learning, memory and coordination. On the other hand, white matter consists mostly of oligodendroglial cells, myelinated axons and capillaries. White matter allows communication to and from gray matter areas, and between gray matter and the other parts of the body. It functions by transmitting the information from the different parts of the body towards the cerebral cortex. It modulates the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions [7]. Changes in gray matter are known to be primarily associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, with secondary effects on the white matter [8]. The deficits range from language ability to delayed memory and visuospatial construction. Disrupted white matter organization has been linked to poorer motor performance [9]. Studies have shown altered expressions of a number of genes and proteins involving a wide spectrum of biological functions following exposure to space environments. These alterations induced distinct changes specific to the regions of the brain [10]. Regional difference in stress response was also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray matter and white matter [11].The purpose of the present investigation was to study spaceflight condition-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse gray matter and to compare these changes to those in white matter regions. Our unique data might provide new insights and improve risk assessment for future long-term space travel."

Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon stimulated a shift into a new era of research, merging biology and aerospace in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent fluid flow within the cardiovascular system [1,2,3]. Changes in cardiac output, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and heart morphology have been reported following exposure to the spaceflight environment [4,5,6]. The low-dose radiation environment in space can also initiate structural damage at the DNA, cellular, and organ levels [2].Ongoing studies using multi-omics suggest that the impact of spaceflight appears to vary depending on the model, the organ system, the differentiation status of the cells, and the length of spaceflight exposure [7,8]. Studies focused on the cardiovascular system have shown that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) cultured on the International Space Station (ISS) responded to the spaceflight environment by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function [9]. In the cardiac tissue of mice, transcriptional changes induced after 15 days in space include the differential expression of genes related to the cell cycle, senescence, and redox balance [10]. Cardiac remodeling and alterations in the expression of proteasome and extracellular matrix genes occurred in the hearts of Drosophila after 30 days in spaceflight [11]. Little is known, however, about transcriptomic changes in mammalian hearts in vivo following 30 days of spaceflight. A better understanding of transcriptomic changes within the intact heart in space is important for long-term missions planned for the future. In this study, we provide a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes in the mouse heart after 30 days on the ISS."

Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE).

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionRadiation exposure and other stressors experienced during extended deep-space missions have the potential to compromise the function of many bodily systems [1,2,3]. The health risks of spaceflight-induced damage related to the central nervous system (CNS), such as cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative effects, have long been a concern. Animal studies have shown that memory, cognition, motor activity, and other neural functions can be affected under stressful conditions that include both radiation exposure and the spaceflight environment [4,5,6,7,8].Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature in different regions. There have been, however, relatively few studies on the effects of spaceflight stress on specific brain regions. One study found that spaceflight conditions induced distinct protein expression changes in different regions of the mouse brain [9]. Regional differences were also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray and white matter [10]. Our previous flight study [11] demonstrated that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function, and there were distinct changes in protein expression in grey versus white matter.One brain region that is of immense interest in the context of spaceflight is the cortex (CT). It plays a key role in sensory and motor function and is closely associated with locomotion, learning, memory, and coordination [12]. Spaceflight and ground simulation studies have given evidence that microgravity conditions negatively affect sensorimotor and behavioral performance, and the functional architecture of the human brain [13,14,15,16], all of which are associated with cortical activity. These significant neurochemical changes were also observed in the rat prefrontal cortex by heavy charged particle irradiation [17]. The frontal cortex (FCT) plays a role in memory, attention, judgment, consciousness, and behavior [18]. Pathophysiological changes in the FCT are associated with depression and anxiety [19].Another brain region that is critical to understand in the context of spaceflight is the hippocampus, a complex brain structure embedded deep in the temporal lobe. It plays a major role in learning and memory [20]. Ground-based analog studies have found that simulated microgravity influences cognitive function, with increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors that were associated with hippocampal activities [21]. In addition, significantly altered expression of many proteins that relate to metabolism and structure in the hippocampus has been observed to occur under simulated microgravity [22,23]. Space radiation studies have revealed cognitive detriment and changes in morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA) regions following oxygen-particle irradiation [24]. The DG is located in the deep region of the hippocampus and has been shown to play an important role in pattern separation and associative memory [25]. The CA contains pyramidal cells with a vast network of interneurons; its function is related to memory and consciousness [25].Spaceflight conditions are associated with oxidative stress [26], which contributes to cellular damage in a variety of tissues. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+(BuOE), a manganese porphyrin superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, also termed BMX-001, is remarkably beneficial in many animal models of oxidative stress injury [27]. One study demonstrated that BuOE can reduce oxidative stress damage to the brain caused by radiation exposure [28]. Our recent study [29] showed that BuOE treatment during spaceflight significantly reduces the immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-hydroxynonena (4-HNE) in the retina. This suggests that BuOE is effective in alleviating stress responses to spaceflight [29]. Our present study will test whether BuOE treatment during spaceflight can attenuate spaceflight-induced alterations in gene transcription in specific brain regions.Despite broad interest in understanding region-specific stress responses, characterizing these changes has been a challenge. More recently, spatial transcriptomics technology has been developed, which allows us to simultaneously quantify gene expression levels and their spatial distribution within tissue sections. This method can help to better understand biological responses as well as disease development [30,31]. In this study, we took advantage of this technology by using the Nanostring GeoMx®digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform [32] to investigate spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression profiles in mouse CT, FCT, and hippocampal DG and CA regions, both with and without BuOE treatment. Our unique spatial sequencing data may, for the first time, provide insights into the organization and response of specific brain regions to the spaceflight environment, potentially improving risk assessment of long-term space travel."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionReceptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals [1]. By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction [2]. These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response [3]. For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion.RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain [4]. The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain [5]. Interestingly, while somePERKslikeBnPERK1andAtPERK4locate on the plasma membrane,AtPERK13has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall [6,7,8,9]. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed inBnPERK1andAtPERK4[7,10].InArabidopsis thaliana, thePERKgene family consists of 15 members, some of which show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs [11]. However, someAtPERKgenes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such asAtPERK1,which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation ofPERKsin response to different stress conditions [5]. For example, the expression ofTaPERKsin wheat andGhPERKsin cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity [12,13]. InA. thaliana,AtPERK13has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role ofPERKsin maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation [9]. In rice, thePERKgene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability ofPERKsto diverse environmental cues [14]. Additionally,PERKshave been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression ofTaPERKsis influenced by fungal pathogens, andBnPERK1has been shown to respond to the pathogenSclerotinia sclerotiorum[7,12,15]. In summary,PERKsare versatile players in response to various stresses.PERKsalso play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have highlighted the involvement ofPERKsin the regulation of growth and development in response to hormonal signals [10,13,16]. For instance,AtPERK4has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation [10]. Furthermore, the expression profiles ofOsPERKsandGhPERKshave shown differential expression patterns under different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin [13,16]. The intricate regulation ofPERKsby different plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress responses.In summary,PERKgenes are known to be critical to plant growth, development, and stress responses. Despite the essential roles ofPERKsin various processes across various plant species, comprehensive studies on thePERKgene family inBrassica napus(oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and animal feed, are still limited [17]. This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors,B. rapa(AA = 20) andB. oleracea(CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago [18]. While a comprehensive study ofBrPERKgenes has been completed in male-sterileB. rapaplants, identifying 25BrPERKgenes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies inB. napusremain scarce [19].This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study ofBnPERKgenes to include the exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study also investigated the role ofBnPERKsin response to the obligate pathogenPlasmodiophora brassicae,which causes clubroot disease inBrassicaspecies. By providing insights into the molecular and functional roles ofBnPERKs, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in crop improvement."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionPlant cultivation will be essential during long duration space missions to supplement nutritional needs of the crew, purify air and water, and provide psychological benefits to the crew [1]. One unfamiliar stress that spaceflight and extraterrestrial environments pose to plant growth is the lack of or reduced gravity. Since both the Moon and Mars have gravitational fields that are a fraction of Earth’s gravity, partial gravity research is especially relevant to near term space exploration [2].On Earth, slowly rotating platforms, called clinostats, can be used to simulate microgravity. However, a certain amount of mechanical stimulation occurs during clinorotation that can be difficult to disentangle from gravitational response [3]. Similarly, partial gravity can be simulated on Earth through the use of clinostats affixed with centrifuges [4], with the same limitations as simulating microgravity. True reduction of gravitational stimuli only occurs during spaceflight where the orbital acceleration of the spacecraft counteracts the pull of Earth’s gravity and renders organisms onboard the craft “weightless”. In addition to providing a ‘1g’ control for flight experiments, programmable centrifuges, such as the (recently decommissioned) European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on the International Space Station (ISS), allowed for the generation of partial gravitational forces during spaceflight.Plant transcriptional responses to microgravity conditions onboard spacecraft have been characterized in numerous studies [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. Differing methodology and hardware choices confound direct comparisons between these studies, butArabidopsisgene expression alterations in response to spaceflight have been observed for a variety of protein functional groups, including heat shock proteins (HSP)s [7,10,11], plant defense proteins [8], light response proteins [12], and cell wall proteins [9,10]. However, only a few spaceflight experiments to date have examined gene expression under fractional gravity in a systematic fashion [15,16].The studies that have examined the effects of partial gravity during spaceflight have revealed a suite of transcriptional and physiological changes that occur with varying intensity as gravity increases from microgravity towards 1g. Some physiological responses vary in a step-like fashion with increasing gravity. For example, blue light phototropism in roots is highly apparent in microgravity but decreases rapidly as soon as plants receive gravitational stimuli [17]. This physiological change is mirrored on a transcriptional level, with genes related to photosynthesis and light response decreasing as gravity increases [15]. Other genes appear to exhibit curved or J-shaped dose-response to gravitational stimuli. Herranz et al. [15] observed more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at low (<0.1g) gravity than either microgravity or higher g levels. These DEGs include many genes associated with plant stress response. Clinostat studies have also demonstrated this J-shaped response to gravitational stimuli in regard to nucleolus size—a proxy for ribosome biogenesis [4]. In this case, the nucleolar area decreased as gravity increased from simulated microgravity to 0.18gthen slowly increased again with increasing gravitational force.Increasingg-gradients to above 1g, known as hypergravity, can provide further insight on plant response to gravitational stimuli. Hypergravity induces distinct changes in plant cell wall composition, such as increasing the amount of cell wall polysaccharides and overall cell wall rigidity [18]. Hypergravity also shifts the balance between meristematic cell growth and cell proliferation, with greater cell growth but lower cell proliferation under higherglevels [19]. Both cell wall remodeling and cell growth alterations occur in an inverse manner to microgravity-grown plants, supporting the idea that gradients in gravitational force can alter plant structure and function in predictable patterns [18,19].In our experiments, we investigated plant transcriptional responses along a gradient from 0.55gto 1gusing the EMCS hardware. The independently controlled rotors on the EMCS allowed us to simulate this gradient of gravity along one rotor and compare with simultaneously grown microgravity samples on a second rotor within the same environmental chamber. We identified 101 genes which show clear patterns of response to fractional g levels. These include several transcription factors, genes involved in cell wall modification, plant defense responses and heat shock proteins. To further investigate the effects of altered gravity on key DEGs, we examined the response of select heat shock protein genes to hypergravity."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nUnderstanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity.

Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca\n++\nsignaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1\ng\nonboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1\ng\nand microgravity (μ\ng\n) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionAs an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water (Fu et al., 2016;De Micco et al., 2023). Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation.It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground.Further, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses (Manzano et al., 2022;Olanrewaju et al., 2023). A recent meta-analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects (Barker et al., 2023). The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls. A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots (Paul et al., 2013). Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space.Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues –light and gravity– have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions.The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years (Brinckmann, 1999;Kittang et al., 2014). In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impartglevels ranging from 0 - 2g. The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1gcontrol in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity.Spaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli (Millar et al., 2010;Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partialglevels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases inglevels (Sheppard et al., 2021). Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1gcontrols (Herranz et al., 2019;Villacampa et al., 2021). These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts.In this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the ISS. In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS. The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup. Furthermore, onboard 1gcontrols facilitated the identification of microgravity-specific differences in gene expression."

        "Title": "RNAseq analysis of rodent spaceflight experiments is confounded by sample collection techniques",
        "Abstract": "Graphical Abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of Medicine, 2008). Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure (Shen et al., 2017;Spatz et al., 2017;Tascher et al., 2017), liver (Beheshti et al., 2019;Jonscher et al., 2016), and immune functions (Pecaut et al., 2017;Rettig et al., 2017;Ward et al., 2018).Despite success of the rodent model, sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. These are related to hardware limitations, small sample size, and severe restraints on astronaut crew availability. Successful experiments must work within these constraints to produce meaningful insights. In response, the first Rodent Research (RR) mission established new capabilities for conducting reliable long-duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Animals can either be euthanized onboard the ISS or returned to Earth alive. Both approaches introduce confounding factors. The former is experimentally challenging but preserves the sample during exposure to microgravity, whereas the latter exposes the animal to re-entry stresses, and sampling occurs only after a variable lag between landing and euthanasia—essentially sampling re-adaptation to Earth conditions in addition to the response to spaceflight. Inconsistent handling of samples necessitates a clear understanding of how dissection and preservation protocols affect downstream data generation.We previously showed, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical data from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3), and Space Transportation System (STS)-135 missions, that lipotoxic pathways are activated in rodent liver in two different strains of mice that were flown for as long as 42 days in space (Beheshti et al., 2019). Because animals in the RR-1 and RR-3 experiments were euthanized in space, this work suggested that space alone was the most likely cause for similar changes previously observed in liver samples from mice flown during the STS-135 experiments where animals returned alive to Earth (Jonscher et al., 2016). The lipotoxic effect is stronger with duration and may have ramifications for astronauts' health during long missions. This analysis did not include two flight and two ground animals from RR-1, as these animals were dissected immediately after euthanasia on-orbit as opposed to the rest, which were first returned to Earth as intact frozen carcasses for later dissection.Here we now compare RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) datasets generated from livers preserved using these distinct protocols (Table 1). We find large changes in the transcriptome of tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved intact by freezing on-orbit, and dissected after return to Earth. To identify and mediate how the preservation method could have such a large effect on differential gene expression (DGE) results, we performed follow-on experiments to interrogate the role of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods on DGE changes. Our findings have important implications for interpreting existing datasets and the design of future experiments.Table 1.GLDS (GeneLab Data Systems) Datasets Used in This StudyGLDS #TissueStudy TypePreservation MethodLibrary PreparationHow the Dataset was Used in the Present StudyRelevant Figures & TablesGLDS-47LiverSpaceflightImmediatePolyATo compare global gene expression in immediate versus carcass samplesFigure S1GLDS-48LiverSpaceflightImmediate and CarcassPolyATo evaluate gene expression and RNA integrity differences in immediate versus carcass samples and in samples prepared via polyA-selection versus ribo-depletionFigures 1,2,3,4,S1,S2, andS3GLDS-49LiverGroundImmediatePolyATo compare global gene expression in immediate versus carcass samplesFigure S1GLDS-168LiverSpaceflightCarcassRibodepletionTo evaluate gene expression and RNA integrity differences in samples prepared via polyA-selection vs. ribo-depletionFigure 4GLDS-235LiverGroundImmediate and CarcassRibodepletionTo determine a means of carcass preservation that is most consistent with standard laboratory practices in the context of gene expression and RNA integrity and to evaluate the effects of euthanasia and tissue storage methods on gene expressionFigures 5A, 5B,S5A, S5C, S5E, and S5F,Tables 2,S3, andS4GLDS-236QuadricepsGroundImmediate and CarcassRibodepletionTo determine if the means of carcass preservation that is most consistent with standard laboratory practices in the context of gene expression and RNA integrity and if the effects of euthanasia on gene expression are tissue specificFigures 5C, 5D,S5B, and S5D,Tables 3,S5, andS6Open in a new tabImmediate = tissues that were dissected immediately after euthanasia and Carcass = tissues that were dissected from frozen carcasses after partial thawing."

        "Title": "Functional changes in the snail statocyst system elicited by microgravity",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe mollusk statocyst is a mechanosensing organ detecting the animal's orientation with respect to gravity. This system has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nIn terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior (\nHelix lucorum\nL.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation (\nHelix lucorum\nL.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures (\nHelix aspersa\nL.). Experiments were performed 13–42 hours after return to Earth. Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90° head-down pitch was significantly reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control animals. Positive relation between tilt velocity and firing rate was observed in both control and postflight snails, but the response magnitude was significantly larger in postflight snails indicating an enhanced sensitivity to acceleration. A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed.\nConclusions/Significance\nUpregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to conditions on Earth and in space.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionOf all the environmental parameters under which a living organism has been exposed in the course of its evolution only gravity has remained constant. Predation, climate, vegetation, and terrestrial or aquatic habitation, for example, have changed, but the intensity and direction of gravity have not. Most extant vertebrates are gnathostomes or jawed, but in the Devonian period about 400 million years ago the majority of vertebrates were ostracoderms or jawless. Despite this shift within vertebrata, fossil evidence shows that the elaborate sensory structures used to sense the acceleration forces are remarkably conserved[1]. Although less is available in the fossil record on invertebrate sensory structures, recent gene expression studies suggest that gravisensing statocyst system in eumetazoans is in the same way elemental and highly conserved[2].The organism's ability to detect gravity and to live under a gravitational load is critical for its survival. Even rudimentary ciliated protozoa display positive or negative geotaxis[3]. Most if not all invertebrate species can orient their bodies' axis with respect to gravity, but only in a few crustaceans, insects and mollusks has gravireception been more thoroughly studied. In insects it is remarkably robust, but equally complex in design. In gastropods the statocyst is the predominant gravisensing organ, and it has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass comprised of calcium carbonate particles called statoconia (the particles are called otoconia in mammals), and an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells carrying microvilli and giant sensory hair cells carrying, in some species such as land snails, true (9+2)-type kinocilia (supporting cells and kinocilium-bearing hair cells populate the mammalian vestibular sensory regions). Differences lie in the mode of transmission to higher centers. In the snail the nerve bundle from each statocyst projects rostrally into the cerebral ganglion on each side, and each fiber is the axon of an individual hair cell. In vertebrates the nerve bundle from each otolith organ projects into the brainstem bilaterally, and each fiber is the axon of a cranial nerve afferent receiving synaptic inputs from the more numerous hair cells. Similarities once again appear in the existence of efferent fibers in the statocyst nerve projecting from other neural areas for both gastropods[4]and vertebrates[5].With the advent of space flight it is possible to address fundamental questions on the biological principle(s) of gravireception in animals, from humans to invertebrates. A key question is: despite the constancy of gravity, does the nervous system adapt to novel transitions in gravity states, even for transitions of brief duration measured in days? Another key question is: because of the elemental nature of gravireception, do animals respond similarly to altered gravity states and adapt to the new, and in the case of postflight the original, environment? In this study we address these questions in an invertebrate model.In two unmanned orbital missions on the Russian spacecrafts Foton M-2 and M-3 we investigated the response of the snail gravisensing system to the space mission, which persists largely of the µG exposure, within a brief delay after landing. The terrestrial snailHelix lucorumLinnaeus (Pulmonata, Gastropoda) offered an excellent model of study. Because these animals are small, we had a sufficient sample size and still remained within our volume limit. Snails are resilient and can remain metabolically active under confined conditions for weeks. Importantly, certain behaviors and the cellular networks underlying them are well described in this animal[6]. Experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of changes in gravity states on three separate but related areas of statocyst function. First, we studied the behavioral (whole animal) response to sudden orientation shifts with respect to gravity, known as negative gravitaxis. This is a ubiquitous behavior found throughout nature. Second, we used electrophysiological techniques in the same subpopulation of snails examined for their behavioral response to tilt to determine the postflight response of individual hair cells to controlled tilts. In vertebrates, the cranial nerve afferents reporting to the brain the head acceleration sensed by the inner ear hair cells show a hypersensitivity, or upregulation, of the discharge response during the first days following microgravity exposure[7]. And third, in a separate population of smaller snails (H. aspersa) we examined the subcellular expression patterns of specific neuropeptide genes. Primary statocyst receptor cells express a product of the preproHPep gene - a pedal peptide, HPep, under physiological load[8], and regulation of this gene expression pattern might signal how the statocyst receptor is ‘tuned’ by the gravity vector. The second neuropeptide studied was FMRFamide, an endogenous peptide found in the nervous system throughout the animal kingdom. In invertebrates FMRFamides in fact constitute a major class of peptide neurotransmitters.Preliminary conference reports on Foton M-2 and Foton M-3 flight experiments were presented[9],[10]."

        "Title": "Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nNatural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.\nSubject terms:\nTumour immunology, Haematological cancer",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionNatural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a first line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transformation, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones, without the need for prior sensitization, before they can proliferate and give rise to disease1. In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis. During future missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), such as those NASA and other space agencies are planning to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and Mars, astronauts will be exposed to a complex ionizing radiation (IR) environment, consisting of solar energetic particles (SEP) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) that contain high atomic number and energy (HZE) charged particles. The high linear energy transfer (LET) and correspondingly higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of HZE particles will expose astronauts on exploration missions to cumulative IR doses that could increase cancer risk4–7. This possibility led NASA to identify space radiation-induced carcinogenesis as one of the top “red” risks limiting long-duration missions in deep space8,9[https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/intro/]. While there are no documented cases of space radiation-induced cancer in astronauts who have flown in space, this is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of astronauts who have flown in space have done so aboard the ISS, which orbits at an altitude of only 254 miles above the surface of the Earth. Since the Earth’s magnetosphere, which provides a shield from space radiation8–10, extends out to a distance of roughly 37,000 miles from the Earth, astronauts board the ISS receive very minimal exposures to space radiation. While astronauts that flew the Apollo missions to the lunar surface traveled beyond this distance, these missions were very short in duration (days), and they were carefully timed to coincide with the period each month during which the Moon falls within the Earth’s 370,000 mile long magnetotail, thereby shielding these astronauts from any significant exposures. NASA and other space agencies are planning extended missions on the lunar surface, missions to near-Earth asteroids, and ultimately manned missions to Mars, all of which will place astronauts well beyond the protection of Earth’s magnetosphere for long periods of time (the current estimate for a roundtrip Mars mission is ~3 years). As such, astronauts will be exposed to significant doses11,12of solar energetic particles (“SEP”, high energy protons) and galactic cosmic rays (“GCR”, atomic nuclei stripped of their outer electron shells), the biological impact of which is currently not well understood. Highlighting the potential for carcinogenesis as a result of exposure to the types and doses of IR to which astronauts will be exposed, we previously reported13the induction of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mice that were repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses11,12of56Fe ions. This is the only report to-date of a human malignancy following exposure to space radiation. While these findings are concerning in their own right, the well documented dysregulation of multiple facets of the immune response that occurs during even short duration spaceflight14–17suggests that accurate cancer risk assessment during future multiple-year missions in deep space will require consideration of not just the incidence of carcinogenesis arising from IR exposure, but also the fitness of the astronauts’ anti-tumor immunity.Given their key role in anti-tumor immunity, several studies have begun addressing the effect of spaceflight on the functionality of human NK cells18–26. While these studies have collectively revealed that spaceflight stressors, in particular microgravity, negatively impact NK cells, it is important to note that these studies were all conducted on Earth under conditions of normal gravity. Specifically, in the studies utilizing NK cells from crew members, cells were isolated during or immediately following spaceflight, and they were then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Similarly, in all of the in vitro studies using ground-based analogs of microgravity such as the NASA-designed Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV - Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX, USA), cytotoxicity assays were performed after culture of NK cells for a period of time in simulated microgravity, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, it is possible that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight.To better model the ability of astronauts’ NK cells to continually monitor for and eliminate any transformed cells that emerge as a result of exposure to SEP/GCR radiation, and thereby be able to accurately estimate cancer risk, we performed studies, using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight. We utilized both standard K-562 cells and T-ALL cells as targets, given our prior work demonstrating the induction of this malignancy as a result of exposure of human HSC to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions. Results obtained in conditions of continuous microgravity were then compared to those obtained with “traditional” methods in which NK cells were exposed to simulated microgravity, centrifuged, and then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Our results show that NK function is significantly more impaired when simulated microgravity conditions are maintained uninterrupted throughout the cytotoxicity assay period, suggesting prior work may have underestimated the impact microgravity exerts on these critical immune cells. Of particular note was the marked reduction in cytotoxicity against T-ALL, raising the novel and troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. These data thus highlight the need for further research to address the question of the role microgravity may play in the induction of neoplastic transformation/cancer development. RNA-seq analyses on NK cells isolated from two healthy adult human donors revealed myriad pathways that were altered by simulated microgravity, paving the way for future studies to develop targeted countermeasures to help mitigate this risk and safeguard astronaut health."

        "Title": "Multi-analyte biochip (MAB) based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ASSISE) for physiological research",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media\n1-4\n. An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H\n+\n, Ca\n2+\n, and CO\n3\n2-\nions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer (\ni.e.\nPt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal.\nThe lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface\n5-7\n. To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)\n7-9\nin place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) (\nFigure 1\n).\nCalibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO\n3\n2-\n(measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca\n2+\n(log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga\nChlorella vulgaris\n.\nThe MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space.\nBiochip Design and Experimental Methods\nThe biochip is 10 x 11 mm in dimension and has 9 ASSISEs designated as working electrodes (WEs) and 5 Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (REs). Each working electrode (WE) is 240 μm in diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 μm in diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic deposition methods are used to electropolymerize the PEDOT films using a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 cell stand (\nFigure 3\n). The counter-ion for the PEDOT film is tailored to suit the analyte ion of interest. A PEDOT with poly(styrenesulfonate) counter ion (PEDOT/PSS) is utilized for H\n+\nand CO\n3\n2-\n, while one with sulphate (added to the solution as CaSO\n4\n) is utilized for Ca\n2+\n. The electrochemical properties of the PEDOT-coated WE is analyzed using CVs in redox-active solution (\ni.e.\n2 mM potassium ferricyanide (K\n3\nFe(CN)\n6\n)). Based on the CV profile, Randles-Sevcik analysis was used to determine the effective surface area\n10\n. Spin-coating at 1,500 rpm is used to cast ~2 μm thick ion-selective membranes (ISMs) on the MAB working electrodes (WEs).\nThe MAB is contained in a microfluidic flow-cell chamber filled with a 150 μl volume of algal medium; the contact pads are electrically connected to the BASI system (\nFigure 4\n).

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe space race is entering a new era of exploration, in which the number of robotic and human missions to various places in our solar system is rapidly increasing. Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low payload requirements. In this context, lab-on-a-chip nanobiosensors appear to be an emerging technology capable of revolutionizing space exploration, given their low footprint, high accuracy, and low payload requirements. To date, only some approaches for monitoring astronaut health in spacecraft environments have been reported. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in space.\nKeywords:\nbiosensors, point of care, lab on chip, space exploration, extreme environment",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionFrom an anthropocentric perspective, all terrestrial habitats characterized by harsh environmental conditions are identified as extreme environments (Merino et al., 2019). Under these conditions, including extremely high or low pressure, temperature, pH, salinity, and radiation, the lives of humans are severely challenged and their survival is generally restricted to a very limited number of circumstances. Despite this, extreme environments cover a wide portion of Earth’s surface and are also thought to be abundant in our solar system and beyond (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001;Ando et al., 2021). Harsh environmental conditions, which are not only related to natural habitats and hostile remote areas, are also often reported in manufacturing, processing and production sectors of diverse industrial branches, such as automotive, aerospace, nuclear, geothermal and oil and natural gas industries (Fahrner et al., 2001;Johnson et al., 2004). In this regard, an industrial harsh environment can affect machinery life cycles, equipment reliability, efficiency, and productivity of the industry itself, and not least the safety of operators (French et al., 2016).On Earth’s surface, there are numerous natural sites whose environmental conditions are easily assimilable to those of celestial bodies in our solar system (Hestroffer et al., 2019). Sea ice and permafrost in Polar regions, cold seeps, hydrothermal vents, hot springs, fumaroles, mud volcanoes, hyperacidic or saline lakes, deserts, and arid environments, or nuclear contaminated sites, mimicking conditions that could be found on early Earth, strongly resemble the surface of rocky planets, the large icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter, hydrocarbon-rich environments like Titan, etc. [1] (Preston and Dartnell, 2014).In situobservations, in addition to the analysis of water, soil, and biofilm samples collected from these environments, can give fundamental clues about the environmental parameter limits, like pH, temperature, pressure, or salinity, in which life can be found on Earth, and thus presumably elsewhere. These environments are perfect scenarios for testing methods, protocols, models, technologies, and hardware useful for studying geosphere-biosphere coevolution (Yadav et al., 2021). In this way, it is possible to detect the biosignatures and biomarkers useful for space exploration. Finding specific types of molecules in these environments could provide clues about the nature of markers to look for in the cosmos. All these aspects make Earth’s extreme environments perfect natural laboratories where to explore the origin (Botta et al., 2017) and the limits of life (Pikuta et al., 2007), as well as excellent testing grounds for technologies with broader applications in various industrial sectors, and that can be used both during the exploration of our planet and beyond.Space exploration and space biology are entering a new golden age, with the number of ongoing and planned missions, both manned and unmanned, rapidly increasing as reported by NASA.1Our ability to accurately performin situanalytical measurements under harsh environmental conditions on Earth and, in the future, on other planetary bodies will play a key role in enabling deep-space missions (Covone et al., 2021). Current practices for the detection and identification of chemical and biological compounds are essentially based on the use of classical analytical instrumental methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), mass spectrometry (MS), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), and so on. These techniques represent the gold standard in analytical chemistry, but require instruments of large size and weight, long time, and effort for sample preparation and analysis, and often involve the use of advanced equipment and modern clean rooms. For all these aspects, these techniques are unsuitable forin situreal-time analytical detection, especially in remote locations and in space, where reduced footprint and payload are key requirements (Clatterbaugh et al., 2010;Gastoldi and Cinti, 2023).In extreme environments such as space, human health surveillance is still an unmet goal, and the development of suitable and reliable biosensors is for this purpose a high-priority need. A major breakthrough in the field of analytical chemistry, applied to extreme environments and to space exploration, is the miniaturization and automation of analytical systems that operate on the lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platform. The development of these technologies has been enabled by recent advances in the fields of smart materials, microfluidics, and electronics (Faheem and Cinti, 2023). Furthermore, an increased and more aware use of point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics (Omidfar et al., 2020) and has accelerated the process of digitalizing routine monitoring procedures (Singh et al., 2021). In fact, LoC-based PoC testing systems are portable, efficient and easy-to-use tools for rapidin situdetection, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease, which only require droplets of samples, such as blood, urine, or other body fluids such as saliva, sweat, and tears (Singh et al., 2022a). These characteristics make LoC nanobiosensors ideal for applications in all major sectors related to space and remote environments exploration, from astronauts’ health monitoring to environmental analysis forin situresource utilization and biosignature exploration.The study of extremophiles and extremely hostile locations can answer many questions from the field of evolutionary biology to molecular biology and industrial biology for space exploration. This is in part due to the several significant challenges that can be encountered in studying biological life within extreme environments, such as the need to travel to remote destinations, work in hostile conditions, and face specific dangers associated with studying them. From this perspective, the development of sensors that can be applied to harsh conditions could provide a system for monitoring life in extreme environments and supporting space exploration by humans.In this Review, we will focus our attention on lab-on-a-chip (LoC) nanobiosensors in the context of extreme environments and space exploration, reporting the state-of-the-art of current applications, and highlighting the possible directions for novel device development aimed at space missions and planetary research."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla\nMucoromycota\nand\nZoopagomycota\n, were sequenced. The genome for\nRhizopus delemar\nwas completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced.

Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.\nKeywords:\nfungal evolution, ecological relevance, saprotrophs, pathogens, model organisms",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe first “land” fungi retained their flagella for motility and remained adapted to life in water, and several diverging lineages switched to multicellularity while exploiting new environments [1]. A hallmark of the process of adapting to terrestrial life was the loss of the flagellum, which occurred independently several times during fungal evolution, giving rise to fungi with a hyphal growth form [2]. Prominent among early-divergent fungi is a group of lineages historically known as the zygomycetes, which are unified by similarities in reproductive biology (e.g., the formation of sexual zygospores via undifferentiated gametangia) and mostly do not form macroscopic fruiting bodies, making them more difficult to study thanDikarya[3]. Zygomycetes have also been challenging to study because many species are involved in obligate symbiotic interactions and have not been successfully grown in pure culture [4]. However, subsequent molecular studies have shown that the zygomycete fungi are paraphyletic [5]. Today, zygomycetes are recognized as two independent monophyletic groups divided into six subphyla [6]. Terrestrial environments posed novel challenges to early fungi, and the adaptive solutions that these lineages evolved can today be gleaned from the vast library of genes contained within their genomes [7,8]. While these first land colonizers are now extinct, many of their features are preserved in the genomes of extant zygomycetes. One instance, in which whole-genome data have proven useful, is in understanding the origin and evolution of fungi. About 450 million years ago, combined activities of fungi and plants placed the terrestrial world on a trajectory toward its current state, setting the stage for subsequent evolutionary transitions. Primitive mycorrhiza-like relationships and other forms of fungal–plant associations helped facilitate the successful colonization of land by the first terrestrial plants, and the genes responsible for such interactions are still preserved in fungal genomes [9]. Hence, zygomycete genomes have and will continue to play an integral role in our current understanding of the initial transition of organisms to land [10].The number of sequenced fungal genomes continues to grow exponentially, and genomic data have become widely and freely accessible. While most sequenced genomes are fromAscomycotaandBasidiomycota(Dikarya) species, there have been concerted efforts to sequence genomes of early-diverging and underrepresented lineages [11,12,13,14,15]. Since 2014, the number of zygomycete genomes has grown from a dozen [16] to nearly a thousand. However, 70% of these genomes are still in the draft stage, and not all of them are available. While the number of species with sequenced genomes for all organisms is on the rise, the available pool of zygomycete genomes is exceptional due to its diversity, i.e., one-third of ca. 1000 known zygomycete species have already been sequenced (Supplementary Table S1[17]).The sequencing efforts have not been uniform among different groups ofMucoromycotaandZoopagomycota; for most species, only a single representative genome is available. While several major clades lack a single published genome (e.g.,EryniopsisandNeozygitesinEntomophthoromycotina, and several genera inZoopagomycotina), numerous isolates of several other species have been sequenced (Figure 1). This discrepancy can be largely explained by practical interests since focal species are sometimes chosen for their relevance to human health or biotechnology [18]. In addition, some taxa are common in culture collections whereas other taxa are challenging to grow in vitro or presumably uncultivable [4,11]. The goal of this review is to (1) provide background into the methods that have been used to sequence zygomycete genomes and which genomes have been sequenced, and (2) consider insights into the genomic architecture, gene content, and evolutionary history gained from these data.Figure 1.Open in a new tabDistribution of sequenced genomes among genera.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an\nin vitro\nmicrofluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionExposure to the unique set of spaceflight environmental conditions, including microgravity, cosmic radiation, isolation, and confinement, has been shown to induce significant physiological changes in all studied species to date [1,2,3]. These physiological responses, such as skeletal muscle atrophy, can negatively impact the health of astronauts and may also compromise mission success if left unabated [4]. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying physiological deconditioning in spaceflight have yet to be fully described, and advancement of this mechanistic understanding is essential for the development of molecularly rationalized countermeasures [5]. Such countermeasures can help maintain astronaut health during future spaceflight missions, including long duration voyages to Mars in which current countermeasures are likely to prove insufficient [6].Studies leveraging data from omics disciplines, including transcriptomics, allow for a detailed study of the complex interactions between the molecular landscape of biological systems and spaceflight environmental conditions. Despite the scientific potential of omics datasets captured in spaceflight, only a relatively small number have been collected, mainly due to the resource-intensive nature of spaceflight experiments. NASA GeneLab was established to maximize the use of the limited number of spaceflight omics datasets. The datasets made publicly available via the GeneLab repository represent a variety of omics data types and a range of model organisms, including microbes, plants, cell cultures, vertebrates, and invertebrates [7,8]. Additionally, datasets from ground-based studies that are relevant to the spaceflight environment can be accessed via public repositories, including GeneLab and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [9]. Although physiological and other functional data is required to establish clear relationships between omics changes and physiological changes, independent analysis of omics datasets is still useful for hypothesis generation, which can be used to inform future research directions. There remain numerous opportunities to use publicly available omics datasets to elucidate knowledge gaps in the field of space biology.One such knowledge gap that currently requires further investigation is that of shared and discrete transcriptomic responses across biological tissue types, such as different muscles. Addressing this knowledge gap can prove useful for designing countermeasures that can target multiple tissues, or for providing evidence for the need to employ multiple countermeasures to provide comprehensive protection to a variety of tissues. Aside from its role in locomotion and posture, skeletal muscle plays other vital roles in whole-body health. Skeletal muscle physically shields organs and helps maintain temperature homeostasis. Additionally, as the body’s largest store of amino acids, skeletal muscle engages in crosstalk with other organs, to synthesize organ-specific proteins [10]. When the body is threatened by starvation or disease, skeletal muscle is broken down to provide other organs with energy [11].To date, antigravity muscles in the limbs have been the main focus for studying the skeletal muscle response to spaceflight. These muscles are key to maintaining posture under 1G conditions, and are thus highly susceptible to atrophy when unloaded [12]. Certain antigravity muscles in the lower limb, such as the soleus and gastrocnemius, are also important for circulation, as upon contraction they pump venous blood back to the heart, preventing pooling and stagnation [13].Alongside reduced muscle mass, strength, and endurance, it has been found that the mechanical unloading associated with microgravity induces a shift from type I slow twitch fibers to type II fast twitch fibers [14,15]. Previous spaceflight and ground studies in rodents and humans have also observed that antigravity muscles consisting of mainly type I (slow-twitch) fibers, which are designed for slow and sustained contraction, such as the soleus tend to be more susceptible to atrophy compared to antigravity muscles with more type II (fast-twitch) fibers [16]. Recently, Choi and colleagues reported findings from NASA’s Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission, in which mice were flown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and exposed to microgravity for 37 days. They found that the weight of the soleus in space flown mice was reduced by ~19% compared to ground control mice [17]. In addition, they reported that the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and quadriceps did not show significant atrophy compared to ground control mice [17]. While significant atrophy of the soleus is consistent with findings from similar studies, the finding of non-significant atrophy in the gastrocnemius is contrary to previous space flown mouse studies [18,19,20].Similarly, previous transcriptomic analyses of RR-1 data have reported that the soleus showed the greatest number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [21,22] compared to other muscle tissues. However, all muscle tissues did show significant gene expression changes, and hierarchical clustering of these changes indicated that the muscle tissues can be divided into two distinct groups. Group 1 consisted of plantar flexor muscles, soleus, and gastrocnemius, while group 2 consisted of dorsiflexors EDL and TA and knee extensors, quadriceps. In addition, microgravity responsive changes in immune-related pathway regulation appeared to be more prevalent in group 1 muscles compared to group 2 [21]. A different analysis of RR-1 data highlighted that changes in the expression of clock genes were fairly uniform across the muscle tissues, and yet distinct compared to other tissues such as the liver [22]. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while certain muscles may not undergo significant atrophy in spaceflight, they still undergo molecular changes that may require intervention. Additionally, these findings support the hypothesis that in certain cases, the response to spaceflight is not identical between muscle tissues, due to their distinct morphologies and locomotive functions [16]. Further investigation is required to establish precise differences and similarities between the molecular responses of different muscle tissues. Hence in this study, we compared transcriptomic data from the fast-twitch enriched EDL, and the representative slow-twitch muscle soleus [23], collected during the RR-1 mission. We made use of two analysis approaches, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to determine the impact of the analysis approach on outcomes and to better anticipate the array of biological responses to spaceflight. Subsequently, to better understand the analogous nature of ground-based studies, transcriptomic data from the RR-1 quadriceps was compared to the vastus lateralis from a human bed rest study [24], and transcriptomic data from the gastrocnemius from a different space flown mouse study was compared to matching HU samples from that same study [25].In addition to rodents, invertebrates, includingC. elegansandD. melanogaster, have been established as important model organisms for understanding biological responses to the space environment [26]. While it is possible to isolate muscles in ground laboratories via dissection when the sample size of fresh animals is sufficient [27], whole organism or composite structures such as the head are typically extracted for analysis in spaceflight experiments due to logistical challenges of dissecting samples in orbit. However, insights related to muscle can still be uncovered. For example, reproducible downregulation of muscle-related genes has been observed across the “InternationalC. elegansExperiment FIRST” (ICE-FIRST) and “C. elegansRNA Interference in Space Experiment” (CERISE) microarray experiments [28,29]. Leandro and colleagues performed a comparative analysis of space flownC. elegansfrom the ICE-FIRST experiment and space flownD. melanogasterfrom the GENE experiment [3,30]. Three analysis approaches were tested on the small subset of orthologous genes between the two organisms. Only six genes were found to have a common transcriptomic response in both experiments, with these genes all downregulated and associated with metabolic and neuromuscular signaling [3,31].Terrestrial studies have set a strong precedent for using invertebrate models to develop tools [13,32,33] and study conserved pathways in mammalian biological processes such as aging [34,35,36,37,38]. However, the utility of omics data from space flown invertebrate studies, in anticipating aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight, has yet to be fully investigated. With large, low cost cohorts of genetic mutants, interventional invertebrate studies are useful for establishing correlational relationships between molecular pathways and spaceflight phenotypes, with functional measures needed for causation [29]. We reason that if certain mechanisms are shared between mammals and invertebrate models, invertebrate datasets can potentially augment the limited quantity of vertebrate spaceflight omics datasets. This in turn may prove useful in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight. To test these concepts, we compared the abovementioned RR-1 EDL and soleus muscle datasets with transcriptomic datasets ofC. elegansandD. melanogasterthat were flown in the ICE-FIRST experiment and STS-121 mission, respectively. We found that spaceflight results in discrete transcriptomic signatures between representative slow and fast twitch muscles (soleus and EDL respectively), consistent with their opposing roles in flexion and differential sensitivities to unloading. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed that invertebrate models share select aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight. The life stage of invertebrate models appears to impact the degree by which they recapitulate the responses of mammalian tissues to spaceflight."

The low pH that results from accumulation of acidic metabolic end-products favors the growth ofS. mutansand other acid-tolerant species relative to healthy plaque microflora, as well as the eventual demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of caries. Adherence ofS. mutansto the tooth surface and subsequent biofilm development are mediated by several bacterial factors, including production of sucrose-dependent extracellular glucan polymers by glucosyltransferase enzymes,7specific cell surface adhesins,8,9the major autolysin AtlA,10the quorum-sensing competence (com) system,11and extracellular DNA.12To protect the health of astronauts during space flight missions, it is critical to understand the effects of this environment on both host biology and the host microbiota. Simulated microgravity exposure has been shown to cause increased mandibular and alveolar bone loss13and decreased saliva flow,14significant predisposing host factors that could contribute to development of caries and/or periodontal disease. Traditionally, the approach to maintaining astronaut oral health during space flight missions has been routed in preventative dentistry, whereby astronauts are subjected to rigorous preflight dental screening and treatment.15However, in the face of future long-term space flight missions, research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment are required.15Previous studies on the effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiota have primarily focused on culture-dependent methods of quantifying the numbers of oral bacteria in human subjects before and after spaceflight.16–18Furthermore, astronauts have been shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight.16However, assessment of the physiology and virulence potential of oral pathogens such asS. mutansunder controlled microgravity analog conditions has been relatively lacking. In this respect, rotating wall vessel bioreactors are a common technology used to grow bacteria under microgravity analog conditions in ground-based studies. When completely filled with media (lacking air bubbles or “head space”) and rotated on the axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector, these reactors maintain a low-shear environment (<1 dyn/cm2) whereby gravitational vectors are randomized over the surface of the cells or particles contained within the vessel.19As such, this simulated environment models “weightlessness” by counteracting gravitational forces that would otherwise promote cellular sedimentation.19,20The low-shear force experienced in this microgravity analog system boasts the additional advantage of mimicking the low-shear force of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by plaque bacteria in the oral cavity.21In this study, high-aspect rotating vessels (HARVs) were therefore used to ascertain the effects of simulated microgravity onS. mutansgene expression, physiology, oxidative stress resistance, and competence, using both culture-dependent and “-omic” (metabolomics and RNA-seq) approaches."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionStaphylococcus aureusis a pernicious pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and organ system in the human body. MostS. aureusstrains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and certain isolates are resistant to nearly all antibiotics used in the clinical setting. The CDC 2019 Antibiotic Threats Report listed methicillin-resistantS. aureus(MRSA) at a “serious” threat level, with over 10,000 estimated deaths in 2017 alone1.S. aureusis a frequent cause of hospital-acquired infections, and in recent years, highly virulent and transmissible community-acquired methicillin-resistantS. aureus(CA-MRSA) strains have emerged. Approximately 30% of humans are nasally colonized byS. aureus, which represents a significant risk factor for invasive infections2. As a pathogen,S. aureusexpresses a vast repertoire of cell surface adhesins, secreted toxins, and tissue-degrading enzymes that contribute to its ability to colonize host tissue, evade the immune system, and transition from a localized to systemic infection. The expression of these virulence factors is coordinated by a complex network of genetic regulators, including the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum-sensing system, which has been extensively reviewed3–7. Theagroperon is comprised of two transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, which are activated by the P2 and P3 promoters, respectively8. RNAIII is an untranslated RNA species that regulates a variety of target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, making it a primary downstream effector of the Agr system, whereas the RNAII transcript contains theagrBDCAgenes [reviewed in refs.6,7]: AgrD, which is processed and secreted out of the cell in a form known as the autoinducing peptide (AIP), AgrB, the membrane protein that performs this processing and secretion, AgrC, a sensor kinase which recognizes the AIP and transduces the signal to AgrA, the response regulator which activates transcription at the P2 and P3 promoters.S. aureusalso poses a potential health risk to astronauts during long-term spaceflight missions. This bacterium was recovered from the nasal passages of Apollo 13 and 14 astronauts at significantly higher numbers compared to preflight samples collected from the same astronauts9, andS. aureuswas also among the most frequently isolated bacteria from astronauts that participated in 25 Space Shuttle missions (STS-26 to STS-50)10. Furthermore, several studies monitoring the presence of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS)11–13as well as in the environment of a full-duration simulation of a crewed return flight to Mars14identified staphylococci as being predominant. Because of the potential threat ofS. aureusto astronaut health, this pathogen’s stress resistance and virulence potential have been studied in both a spaceflight experiment15and in ground-based models15–19of simulated microgravity. In the previous spaceflight experiment,S. aureusvirulence was reduced when assessed as a function of the quantity of residual bacteria in the presence and absence ofCaenorhabditis elegans15. However, these studies were conducted using a nematode feeding model, which does not entirely reflect the complexity ofS. aureuspathogenesis in humans.NASA previously conducted a “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) spaceflight experiment (OSDR accession# OSD-145), designed to measure the response of bothBacillus subtilisandS. aureusto the spaceflight environment20,21. In this experiment, Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs)22were used to grow asynchronous ground controls and spaceflight samples ofS. aureusstrain UAMS-1, a clinical MSSA isolate that was originally isolated from an osteomyelitis infection23. Herein, our analysis of theS. aureusRNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 suggests thatS. aureusspaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures. Furthermore,agrgenes and several positively regulated targets were the most highly upregulated transcripts in spaceflight. We also performed secretome analysis of culture supernatants from the BRIC-23 spaceflight and ground control cultures, in which several Agr-regulated secreted proteins were increased in abundance in the spaceflight samples. Collectively, these data suggest thatS. aureusexperiences altered metabolism, increased quorum sensing, and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nVacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology.

We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90% of the cell volume. This essential organelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling [1–3]. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant membrane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands (TVS), sheets and bulbs [4,5]. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton [6]. In root hairs ofHydrocharis dubia, TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip [7,8]. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division [9]. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS [10], and disruption of actin filaments results in their dissasembly [11]. Similarly, microinjection of antiserum against two actin-binding proteins of the villin group disrupted the TVS in root hair cells ofH.dubia[7,12]. The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS formation and dynamics [13,14].Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 μm that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, between the folded membranes [5,15]. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts [15]. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion [15], and leaf maturation [16]. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of tobacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3/SYP22 [17] or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2 [18] were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germinating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3 [5], TPK1-GFP [19,20], TIP1;1-GFP [21], or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins [16,22]. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs [23]. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy [15]. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction [24]. Two types of structures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions that showed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and “intra-vacuolar spherical structures” (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimerizing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where only very bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyledon epidermis, where both types of structures existed [24].Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole [15,19]. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identified thus far. These aresgr2-1andvti11, and in both cases these mutants show a reduced number of bulbs [23]. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, andsgr2mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells [25]. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole [26,27]. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, andvti11mutant alleles have highly fragmented vacuoles [28]. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11.Here we describe the phenotype ofregulator of bulb biogenesis1(rbb1-1), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We show thatrbb1-1mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation inrbb1-1may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labeling of bulbs betweenrbb1-1and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identifiedRBB1locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionGrowing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. The space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling1,2. The International Space Station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the ISS1,3. Reduced gravity on the ISS results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. Effects of the spaceflight environment on the ISS include reduced cell elongation4or altered cell division5in roots. At the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity6–8. Other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and ER6. Interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells forArabidopsisseedlings grown on the ISS9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity10,11. Moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity12–14. Those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles15.The plant vacuole is a large essential organelle in plant cells and is important for cell elongation, recycling, and storage, among many other functions16–18. Vacuole enlargement is concomitant with cell growth along the developmental gradient represented by the longitudinal axis of the root. Vacuole enlargement along this gradient requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by two conserved complexes, the homotypic vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)19. Both HOPS and the vacuolar SNARE complexes have vacuole or pre-vacuole-specific subunits that provide specificity to membrane fusion. The vacuolar SNARE complex is formed by SYP22, VTI11, SYP51, and either VAMP72720or VAMP713/VAMP71121–23. A loss of function allele of VTI11,zigzag1(zig-1), has fragmented vacuoles and showed abnormal shoot gravitropism24–26. Thezig-1mutant also has short hypocotyls, small and wrinkled rosette leaves and a zigzag-shaped stem24,25. Wortmannin (WM), a chemical inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), can induce vacuole fusion inzig-1and partially restore its agravitropic shoot phenotype26,27. WM-induced vacuole fusion inzig-1is fast and almost complete vacuole fusion can be observed in roots within two hours26,27. Given the large size of the vacuole in plant cells and the efficiency of WM at inducing its fusion, this treatment represents a unique assay for the study of organelle fusion in plants in space.Plant specimens have been sent to space for fundamental biology research since the 1960s1,3,28and this resulted in the design of specific hardware for optimal growth3,29. The Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) is a fully contained hardware that has been used extensively with small plant seedlings9,30–32and it is suitable for chemical treatments in space. Previous experiments involved storing liquid media or fixative solution inside the chamber of the PDFU for microbial culture or plant tissue fixation33–35. Cell biology research on the ISS requires sample fixation to preserve cell morphology. Chemical fixation in the ISS has been accomplished with non-coagulant agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde9but the latter has high levels of autofluorescence36. Direct fluorescence microscopy of fluorescent proteins from fixed tissues37,38is an effective approach to extract quantitative information of cell structure at high samples size, but the viability of fluorescence microscopy of tissues fixed in space has not been demonstrated given the challenges imposed by the BRIC hardware.Here, we took advantage of the WM-induced vacuole fusion inzig-1to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Formaldehyde-based tissue fixation in the BRIC-PDFU hardware was used and GFP-tagged vacuoles were imaged post-flight by confocal microscopy. We detected a mild but significant decrease in plant vacuole fusion inzig-1that highlights possible effects of microgravity or other spaceflight stresses on vacuole biogenesis and membrane fusion. This experiment also demonstrates the feasibility of chemical treatment assays on the ISS which may contribute to future cell biology research in this microgravity environment."

        "Title": "Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams include changes in circadian clocks",
        "Abstract": null,
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAt varying phases of the life cycle, there are differential nutrient requirements. During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Homeorhetic adaptations are the “coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process” (Bauman and Currie, 1980;Bell and Bauman, 1997). Whereas homeostasis is widely understood to describe compensatory mechanisms that preserve the relative constancy of functions despite external challenges, homeorhesis refers to regulatory processes that support developmental or physiological processes of highest priority (Bauman et al., 1982). Homeorhetic controls regulate nutrient partitioning during pregnancy, thereby assuring growth of the conceptus as well as development of the mammary gland. With the onset of lactation, many maternal tissues undergo further adaptations to support milk synthesis.During gestation, the endocrine system coordinates the mother's metabolic activities with the physiological requirements of the fetuses and subsequent nutritional demands of the suckling offspring. Mammary gland development and differentiation during pregnancy is the direct result of a network of changes in hormone levels, substrate availability and behavioral adaptations that collectively result in optimal milk production during lactation. During pregnancy, estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen and the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), stimulate mammary growth and differentiation. At parturition, changes in these hormones act to stimulate the onset of lactation (Tucker, 1987;Freeman et al., 2000;Neville et al., 2001;Kelly et al., 2002). Periparturient changes in maternal metabolism include: 1) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, 2) decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, 3) increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and 4) increased amino acid mobilization from muscle (Chaves and Herrera, 1978;Martin-Hidalgo et al., 1994;Bell, 1995). Thus to insure adequate milk production and simultaneously maintain maternal homeostasis, the lactating dam utilizes homeorhetic processes to shift her metabolism.The dam's normal homeorhetic response to the increased nutrient and energy demands of milk synthesis were mediated in part by global changes in gene transcription in mammary, liver and adipose including changes in clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms (Casey et al., 2009;Patel et al., 2011). Changes in molecular clocks during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in relation to other transcriptional profiles of mammary, liver and adipose tissues suggested that homeorhetic adaptation to lactation may be by coordinated in part by the circadian system. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes and can be entrained by external cues (Hastings et al., 2007). Although light is the primary environmental cue that entrains circadian clocks, gravity significantly affects circadian patterns of behavior, hormones, body temperature, and metabolism (Czeisler et al., 1991;Whitson et al., 1995;Fuller et al., 2000;Murakami and Fuller, 2000;Robinson and Fuller, 2000;Dijk et al., 2001;Fuller et al., 2002;Holley et al., 2003).Gravity is an environmental stimulus that exerts major influences on animal physiology and behavior (Sonnenfeld, 2005). Similar to other environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, animals have adapted to the Earth's gravitational force. In mammals, sudden deviations from Earth's 1-g environment are associated with significant physiological changes, including altered reproductive capability (Tou et al., 2002). Studies investigating the effects of gravity and circadian rhythms on reproducing and developing mammals can provide unique biomedical perspectives on these life processes on Earth (Ronca, 2007).We previously identified gravity as an environmental variable that produces major graded changes in mammary metabolic activity and reduces pup survival (Ronca et al., 2001;Plaut et al., 2003). We and others showed that survival rates of pups born to rat dams exposed to 1.5- to 2-times Earth's gravity during the latter half of pregnancy were reduced by 5 to 40% (Megory and Oyama, 1984;Baer et al., 2000;Ronca et al., 2001). However, if neonatal pups were removed from the hypergravity environment and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). These data suggest that the dam's normal homeorhetic response to the onset of lactation was altered in hypergravity, thereby decreasing her ability to nurture pups. Although HG dams had reduced body fat and mass, these factors did not account for altered rates of lipid metabolism in mammary, liver and adipose tissues or decreased neonatal survival (Lintault et al., 2007). Further, neither prolactin nor glucocorticoid supplementation reversed the HG induced reduction in metabolic rates, suggesting that factors other than circulating lactogenic hormone levels and dam body composition were negatively impacting the dams' homeorhetic response to pregnancy and lactation (Patel et al., 2008). Collectively, these findings indicate a disruption of homeorhetic mechanisms that normally allow the dam to maintain homeostasis while simultaneously providing for growing fetuses and neonates.In the present study, we measured the effect of exposure to 2-g from mid-gestation (gestational day [G]11 of the rat's 22-day pregnancy) throughout early lactation (until Postnatal day [P]3) on metabolic activity of mammary, liver and adipose tissue as well as circulating hormone and metabolite levels, and maternal behavior in relation to pup survival. We tested whether hypergravity affects homeorhetic responses in the dam thereby affecting lipid metabolism and pup survival. We also examined the hypothesis that alterations to the dam's circadian system induced by changes in gravitational force may limit homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (\nBdnf IV\n) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.\nKeywords:\nprenatal stress, maternal stress, DNA methylation, telomere length",

IntroductionPerturbations during gestation in the form of malnutrition, infection, or psychosocial stress have devastating consequences on the physical and mental well-being of offspring. For example, individuals exposed to famine during gestation (such as that of the Dutch Famine of 1944) have significant physical health problems including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure (Painter et al., 2008;Roseboom et al., 2011). Gestational famine exposure also produces long-lasting neurobiological and behavioral consequences, including an increased incidence of schizophrenia (Hoek et al., 1996;Roseboom et al., 2011). Psychosocial stress experienced by the mother during gestation likewise produces vulnerability to psychopathology in offspring, including increased risk for schizophrenia and depression (Betts et al., 2015;Malaspina et al., 2008). Further, work from various animal models provides additional evidence that a suboptimal intrauterine environment has long-term physical and behavioral consequences for offspring (for reviews see (Bock et al., 2015;Driscoll and Barr, 2016;Lupien et al., 2009)).One way that prenatal stress could affect brain function and behavior is through epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. DNA methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups to cytosines, typically at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CG sites), which can dampen transcriptional activity through the blockade of transcription factors or the recruitment of transcriptional silencing machinery. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of active DNA demethylation in regulating transcription within the CNS, and candidates thought to reverse DNA methylation include ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins (Kohli and Zhang, 2013), GADD45b (Ma et al., 2009), and MBD2 (Detich et al., 2002). Though historically associated with early cell development and differentiation, there is now a vast literature showing that DNA methylation/demethylation remains an active process even occurring in mature neurons. Further, studies in humans (Cao-Lei et al., 2014;Kundakovic and Champagne, 2011;Nye et al., 2014) and animal models (Boersma et al., 2014;Dong et al., 2015;Jensen Peña et al., 2012;Matrisciano et al., 2013;Morgan and Bale, 2011;Mueller and Bale, 2007,2008) have highlighted the ability of prenatal stress to alter DNA methylation at various gene loci, including the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. BDNF is crucial for development and plasticity in the developing and adult brain and is implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD (Martinowich et al., 2007). Given the widespread functioning of BDNF across brain regions throughout early development, this locus may play a role in translating prenatal stress to adult phenotypic outcomes including psychopathology.Recent work has also sought to characterize the detrimental impact of early-life stress by examining changes in telomere length –stretches of TTAGGG repeats located on the ends of chromosomes (for a comprehensive review, see (Blaze et al., 2015)). Studies continue to show that various forms of early-life stress (e.g., perinatal complications, psychological stress, physical abuse, etc.) during the prenatal (Entringer et al., 2011;Entringer et al., 2013;Shalev et al., 2014a) or postnatal (Asok et al., 2013;Kananen et al., 2010;Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2011;O’Donovan et al., 2011;Tyrka et al., 2010) period shorten telomere length in the periphery. Given that telomeres are dynamically regulated during the first years of life (Slagboom et al., 1994;Zeichner et al., 1999), examining neural changes in telomere length following prenatal stress is another important avenue for understanding how stress experienced in early-life may relate to future mental well-being.In daily life, humans tend to be exposed to unpredictable challenges that vary in magnitude and duration. Studies of prenatal stress in rodents often employ repeated presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, most frequently, immobilization stress (de Souza et al., 2013;Jensen Peña et al., 2012;Matrisciano et al., 2013), a well-known stressor in rodents (Dallman et al., 2004;McEwen and Magarinos, 1997;Paré and Glavin, 1986). Rodent studies however provide evidence for habituation to predictable, non-varying stressors (Armario, 2006;Daviu et al., 2014). In contrast, chronic variable stress in adult males is associated with greater HPA axis responses, including baseline hypersecretion of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin, as well as adrenal hypertrophy (Herman et al., 1995). Repeated exposure of pregnant rats to uncontrollable stress elicited a prolonged (24–48hr) increase in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids from gestational day 4 to 20 (Takahashi et al., 1998), an effect also observed in day 20 fetuses, suggesting that habituation to variable stressors across the rat’s three week pregnancy is minimal. Importantly, as compared to studies employing presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms have reported etiological changes that may be more closely linked to psychiatric disorders (Bock et al., 2015;Mueller and Bale, 2008;Sickmann et al., 2015;Wilson et al., 2012). Collectively, these findings suggest that variable, unpredictable stress may model the human condition with greater fidelity than invariant stress paradigms.The current study was designed to characterize changes inBdnf IVDNA methylation and telomere length across multiple discrete brain regions of the adult rat following unpredictable variable prenatal stress (UVPS). We chose to focus on the mPFC, ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and central/basolateral amygdala, as our prior work showed changes inBdnf IVDNA methylation and telomere length in these regions in adult animals subjected to adverse caregiving conditions during the first postnatal week (Asok et al., 2014;Blaze et al., 2013;Roth et al., 2009;Roth et al., 2014). Changes inBdnf IVDNA methylation have also been found in these same brain regions in other models of prenatal stress (Boersma et al., 2014;Dong et al., 2015), and changes at this locus within these same brain regions are known to regulate neural function and behavior including fear conditioning and extinction (Baker-Andresen et al., 2013a;Lubin et al., 2008;Martinowich et al., 2003)."

Therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel.Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity.6Disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews.7Experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8In contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading.9,10These phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males.9,10Moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11However, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12One key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts.The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity environment.

        "Title": "Brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1)-dependent brassinosteroid signalling pathway leads to ectopic activation of quiescent cell division and suppresses columella stem cell differentiation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) (Supplementary Figure S1available atJXBonline;Bennett and Scheres, 2010). Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascular tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure [lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs)], the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentiation zone (Perilli and Sabatini, 2010;Leeet al., 2013). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and meristematic cells of the proximal/distal meristems, and differentiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation/differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination (Scheres, 2007;Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cell—which is separate from the QC—divides to form transit-amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (Scheres, 2007;Perilliet al., 2012).Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed inBennett and Scheres, 2010;Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011;Leeet al., 2013). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Frimlet al., 2003;Blilouet al., 2005). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem (Sabatiniet al., 1999). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) (Grieneisenet al., 2007). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewiczet al., 2007).Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hormones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes (Zhuet al., 2013). Upon binding of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1/SERK3)(Bücherlet al., 2013), and the fully activated BRI1/BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassinazole resistant 1/BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1/BES2) and BZR2/BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development (Heet al., 2005;Sunet al., 2010;Yuet al., 2011). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1/BES1 is crucial for BR activities (Wanget al., 2002;Yinet al., 2002), and this localization is dependent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1/BES1 proteins (Gampalaet al., 2007;Ryuet al., 2007;Ryuet al., 2010). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1/BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway (Li and Nam, 2002;Yanet al., 2009). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth (Tanget al., 2011).BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations (Müssiget al., 2003;Kimet al., 2007). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in theArabidopsisroot meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such asbes1-D, show premature cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of meristematic cells (Gonzalez-Garciaet al., 2011). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of provascular and QC cells (Fàbregaset al., 2013). Recently two BR transcriptional targets— brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRAVO) and ethylene response factor 115 (ERF115)—regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified (Heymanet al., 2013;Vilarrasa-Blasiet al., 2014). BRAVO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRAVO (Vilarrasa-Blasiet al., 2014). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulatingERF115expression (Heymanet al., 2013).Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulation/re-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distribution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expression regulation ofBRAVO,ERF115, and other root-regulating genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-/BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs inArabidopsisroots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner."

        "Title": "Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi",
        "Abstract": null,
        "Introduction": "IntroductionFungal pathogens cause devastating losses of crops and postharvest fruits worldwide (Chenet al.,2008). Many chemical fungicides have been used in high doses and frequent intervals to prevent these losses by killing different fungal species. The global market for fungicides was estimated to be over $7.4 billion in 2005 (Morton and Staub,2008) and is expected to rise to over $20 billion by 2017 (Israel,2013). To reduce the risk of crop disease and enhance the safety of food, new effective fungicides or strategies to increase the potency of current fungicides need to be developed.One limitation to the potency of fungicides is their rapid detoxification by fungi via their sequestration or export across the plasma membrane. Fungi use diverse cellular mechanisms for the export of xenobiotics. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, together with major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters, are the most extensively studied families of transporters involved in fungal efflux mechanisms (Perlinet al.,2014). ABC and MFS multidrug transporters promote fungicide resistance in plant‐pathogenic fungi. In the grey mouldBotrytis cinerea, the ABC transporter BcatrD acts synergistically with the MFS transporter Bcmfs1 to mediate sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance (Hayashiet al.,2001,2002). In addition, inB.cinerea, an ABC transporter is important for the detoxification of the plant fungitoxin camalexin, which is secreted by Arabidopsis in response to abiotic and biotic stress (Stefanatoet al.,2009). Further, an ABC transporter (BcatrB) inB. cinereais up‐regulated by treatment with the grapevine phytoalexin resveratrol and the fungicide fenpiclonil (Schoonbeeket al.,2001). Consistent with these findings, aB. cinereaABC transporter mutant (ΔBcatrB) shows increased sensitivity to resveratrol and fenpiclonil during its infection of grapevine, suggesting that BcatrB provides protection against the activity of plant defence compounds and fungicides inB. cinerea. Chemical agents that inhibit the activity of ABC transporters help prevent the disease caused by growth of the pathogenMycosphaerella graminicolaon wheat seedlings, although these agents do not synergize the effectiveness of the fungicide cyproconazole (Roohparvaret al.,2007). More recently, another fungal ABC transporter protein has been shown to play a role in providing resistance to fungicides inClonostchys rosea(Dubeyet al.,2014).Any inhibition of the fungal toxin efflux mechanism would increase the potency of fungicides. For example, in the citrus green mouldPenicillium digitatum, disruption of the ABC transporter gene PMRI causes a loss of DMI resistance. The effect of blocking transporter activity on fungal resistance to fungicides was also explored by Reimann and Deising (2005). They used confocal fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide stains to indirectly evaluate the resistance of fungi to the fungicide azoxystrobin after the application of a transport inhibitor. They first documented that plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence in stainedPyrenophora tritici‐repentisresults from energy‐dependent efflux transporter activity. Then, they found that the addition of the NG5‐13a transporter inhibitor eliminated plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence. The addition of this compound to fungicides allowed chemical control of fungicide‐resistant isolates of the wheat fungal pathogen. These results provide indirect evidence that efflux transporters contribute to fungicide resistance inP. tritici‐repentis. Other authors have also noted that ABC transporters play a key role in aiding the resistance of pathogenic fungi to fungicides by exporting fungicides (e.g. Coleman and Mylonakis,2009; Kretschmeret al.,2009; Perlinet al.,2014; Sanget al.,2015).Plants also detoxify xenobiotics by exporting them, and a previous report has documented that overexpression of either an ABCB1 homologue (AtPgp1) or an apyrase (NTPDase) enzyme (AtAPY1) confers multiherbicide resistance toArabidopsis thalianaplants (Windsoret al.,2003). Furthermore, inhibitors of apyrase enzyme activity suppress the ability of plants to export herbicides and thus increase their sensitivity to these toxins (Windsoret al.,2003). Consistent with these findings are the results of Liuet al. (2012), who showed that genetic suppression of apyrase expression decreased the transport of the growth hormone auxin, a process known to be dependent on the activity of ABCB transporters (Peeret al.,2011). A key function of certain apyrases is to help maintain a low steady state of extracellular ATP (eATP) (Knowles,2011; Limet al.,2014), which is a known regulator of diverse responses in plants and animals (Clarket al.,2014). The blocking of apyrase expression or activity increases [eATP] (Limet al.,2014; Thomaset al.,2000; Wuet al.,2007), and increasing [eATP] promotes the retention of herbicides (Windsoret al.,2003) and suppresses polar auxin transport (Tanget al.,2003), implying that increased [eATP], similar to the blocking of apyrase activity, inhibits the activity of ABC transporters. Taken together, these results support a dual role for apyrases and ABC transporters in herbicide resistance and auxin transport, and indicate that disruption of apyrase activity can inhibit ABC transport activity and thus block the continued efflux of toxic compounds.The ability of apyrase inhibitors to suppress the export of herbicides from plant cells by inhibiting ABCB transport activity raises the possibility that they could suppress the export of fungicides from pathogenic fungi and thus enhance the potency of fungicides. To the extent that apyrase inhibitors are as effective against fungal ABC transporters as they are against plant ABCB transporters, they could enhance the fungicidal potency of fungicides, just as they enhance the herbicidal potency of herbicides.Apyrases have been well studied in animal and plant cells (Clarket al.,2014; Knowles,2011), but have been less well characterized in plant‐pathogenic fungi (Sansom,2012; Sansomet al.,2008). In animal and plant cells, there are both surface‐localized and Golgi‐localized apyrases (Knowles,2011). In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, there are only two apyrases, and both are Golgi localized, where they have been demonstrated to play roles in glycosylation processes in the Golgi lumen (Abeijonet al.,1993; Gaoet al.,1999). In other fungal species, there also appear to be Golgi‐localized apyrases, based on experimental evidence, as well as on sequence analyses that predict their cellular localization. Golgi‐localized apyrases have been characterized in non‐pathogenic and pathogenic fungi, where they play an important role in secretion and cell wall processes (Herreroet al.,2002; Lopez‐Esparzaet al.,2013; Uccellettiet al.,2007). However, there is also some evidence for surface‐localized ecto‐apyrase activity in human fungal pathogens (Collopy‐Junioret al.,2006; Junioret al.,2005; Kiffer‐Moreiraet al.,2010).In addition to apyrases, there are also fungal ectophosphatases that can hydrolyse eATP and eADP, even though theirKmfor these substrates is much higher than that of apyrases. Ectophosphatases have been shown to play important roles in processes of nutrition, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, virulence and infection, and so they could affect fungal resistance to fungicides in other ways (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes,2014). Adhesion to host cells is the first step in the establishment of a fungal infection, and ectophosphatases may be one of the first proteins of pathogens that come into contact with host cells. Recent results have indicated that these ectophosphatase activities increase the potency of fungi to adhere to host cells (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes,2014).The objective of this study was to determine whether or not four specific apyrase inhibitors (AI.1 [N‐(m‐tolyl)‐(1,1′‐biphenyl)‐4‐sulfonamide], AI.10 (S‐heptyl‐2‐oxo‐2H‐chromene‐3‐carbothioate), AI.13 {3‐[N‐(4‐bromophenyl)sulfamoyl]‐N‐(3‐nitrophenyl)benzamide} and AI.15 {(E)‐3‐methyl‐N′‐[1‐(naphthalen‐2‐yl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide}) enhance the potency of the commonly available fungicides to more effectively restrict the growth of several plant‐pathogenic fungal species."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAnnexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that\nann-mutant\nseedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in\nann-mutant\ncotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of\nann-mutant\nseedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of\nann-mutant\nprimary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in\nann-mutant\nroot tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of\nann-mutant\nseedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMicrogravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, CNS, hind limb unloading, microglia, ROS, MCAT",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and isolation have negative effects on almost all systems of the human body, and understanding these effects has become a primary objective for enabling long-term space flights. Exposure to microgravity is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, but it might also have detrimental effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and cognition, since spaceflight results in significant volumetric changes in brain grey matter [1]. Furthermore, simulated microgravity in mice induced impairments in immune functions [2]. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are crucial for maintaining a healthy neural environment promoting homeostasis and responding to infection, or injury. Microglial activation can occur in response to a variety of triggers and is dependent on the type of pathological stressor or event [3]. Once activated, microglia not only primarily act as scavenger cells, removing debris and dying neurons [4], but also perform tissue repair and neural regeneration [5]. Microglia also act as second messengers by releasing a number of substances such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4,6]. Prolonged activations can lead to neuronal damage or death, as well as the activation of astrocytes, resulting in further endangerment to neurons and the further recruitment of microglia, thereby perpetuating the inflammatory state [7,8]. There are a number of potentially useful markers for specific microglia states [9]. Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) is a lysosomal protein expressed at low levels by resting microglia and at high levels by activated phagocytic microglia [7,10,11]. CD68 is commonly used to visualize activated microglia in inflammatory responses in the brain and is potentially a suitable candidate for further exploring microgravity-induced microglial activation.Studies have shown that microgravity and bedrest stimulate changes in immune cell response. Monocytes isolated from astronauts exhibit impaired function (reviewed in [12]). Furthermore, plasma concentrations of TNFα, IL-8, IL-1a, growth factors, and leukocyte recruitment chemokines have been observed to be increased in plasma following spaceflights [13]. Following the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the monocyte secretion of IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 significantly reduced, while IL-1β was elevated postflight [14]. During spaceflight, increased white blood cell count and decreased T cell function have been observed in astronaut crews [15]. Studies using blood collected from human bedrest models of head-down tilt-simulating headward fluid shifts in flight found changes in immune cells [16] and cytokine levels. After two-week hindlimb unloading (HU), a rodent model commonly used to simulate weightlessness, microgravity-induced cephalic fluid shifts, bedrest and anhedonia, the mRNA expression of numerous genes impacting immune response, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory was altered in mouse brains [17]. HU also increased microglia activations in spinal cord [18] and neural stem cells [19]. We previously observed an increase in IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17 in the hippocampus after prolonged HU [20], cytokines that are known to be produced and secreted by activated microglia [8,21], and astrocytes [22,23]. Altered gravity was also observed to downregulate ICAM-1 expression in vitro in murine BV-2 microglial cells, while a subtype of smaller cells of BV-2 microglial cells appeared and was assumed to be activated cells [24]. Overall, previous studies showed that microgravity and bedrest both induced immune response in the CNS, but the microglial activations in the hippocampus in in vivo mouse models have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that head-tilt bedrest will result in microglial activations in the hippocampus.It has been established that spaceflight and spaceflight-like stressors cause oxidative stress responses within the hippocampus [25]. Due to the incomplete mitochondrial metabolization of oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl are generated. Behavioral and cognitive changes were associated with altered measures of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and protein and DNA oxidation in the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions implicated in anxiety and spatial memory [26]. The increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to increased cytokine release from microglial cells, potentially indicating increased microglial activations [27,28]. Mitochondrial ROS is generated by activated microglia [29,30], and reducing its production is believed to be a suitable target to prevent the over-activation of microglia [27,28,31]. A mouse model for mitochondrial ROS quenching via the overexpression of the human catalase gene targeted toward the mitochondria (MCAT) has been previously utilized to investigate oxidative stress. MCAT mice have increased lifespan [32], improved age-dependent pathologies [33], reduced radiation-induced neurogenesis depletion [34], cognitive dysfunction, improved outcomes in models of neurological conditions including ataxia-telangiectasia [35], ALS [36], and Alzheimer’s disease [37]. MCAT mice also exhibit improved hippocampal spatial learning and contextual fear memory [26]. Previously, we showed that MCAT mice were protected from simulated microgravity-induced increases in cytokine expression in hippocampus. In our lab, in the MCAT mice, ROS quenching was demonstrated by measuring 4-HNE [38,39], catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation. We have also seen a strong genotype effect in the MCAT mice, with a significantly lower protein abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In a screen of forty-four cytokines and chemokines, fourteen (IFNγ, IL-4, IL-6,IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP-1, MCSF, RANTES, MCP-5, and IP-10) were downregulated in MCAT vs. WT mice [20]. These results suggest that the increased expression of these cytokines in wildtype hindlimb-unloaded mice is indictive of microglial activations and that mitochondrial ROS play an important role in microglial activation; thus, in this study, we used the MCAT mouse model to see if ROS quenching will mitigate HU-induced microglial activation.Understanding the correlations between molecular changes in the brain, behavior, and plasma markers could refine our understanding of the kinetics of neurodegenerative changes and help find early biomarkers before irreversible damage occurs. Increased cytokine expression and neuroinflammation are associated with changes in behavior. There is evidence that inflammatory factors TNFα and IL-1β are associated with increased sick behaviors [40,41,42]. Theses cytokines have also been implicated in anorexic-like behavior [43]. IFNα is known to induce depression in humans [44], and TNFα is involved in depressive-like behavior as well [45]. In a mouse model, HU resulted in anxiety-like behaviors, which were associated with significant changes in the pattern of neural oscillations in the hippocampus [46]. Oxidative stress enhanced this response, and the inhibition of ROS reduced HU-induced anxiety [47].We previously reported significantly reduced CD4+ T cell numbers and elevation in twelve cytokines in singly, but not socially, housed mice under normal loading conditions [48]. Singly housed mice exposed to simulated microgravity downregulated only one cytokine, IL-13, which is involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and these changes were mitigated in the MCAT mouse model [20]. These data suggest that, under these conditions, social isolation and HU may reflect an epistatic interaction. In this study, we investigated the role of HU alone, without the additional isolation effect, in socially housed animals. MCAT mice were utilized to explore the association between oxidative stress and microglia activation in simulated microgravity. Correlations between microglia activation, cytokine expression and behavior were calculated to further our understanding of the effects of altered gravity on the CNS. In this study, we aim to determine the role of microglia, ROS pathways, and behavior, following head-tilt bedrest to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism behind neuroimmune changes, thus paving the way for future therapies. We hypothesize that head-tilt bedrest will affect microglia activation in the hippocampus and that, in the MCAT model, quenching ROS will mitigate these changes."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn addition to severe skeletal muscle deterioration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has recently been linked to increased incidences of skeletal fractures, as well as elevated serum bone turnover markers in ALS patients (1,2). These patients exhibit decreased bone mineral density, which is associated with increased fracture risks (3,4). It is postulated that reduced mechanical load from skeletal muscle atrophy contributes to bone loss, but the exact alterations in bone functional, or biomechanical, properties are still unclear.The ALS SOD1G93Amouse model has recently been shown to have reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass (5). This bone loss was due to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption in 16-week-old SOD1G93Amice. While this prior study characterized alterations in molecular, cellular, and structural properties of skeleton in the ALS mouse model, the impact of the SOD1G93Amutation on functional properties of the skeleton is still unknown. By assessing the biomechanical properties of long bones from these mice, we can infer alterations in the functional properties of bone as a consequence of ALS.Thus, we examined bone mass, microarchitecture, and biomechanics in ALS SOD1G93Amice. We hypothesized that bone microstructure and biomechanical outcomes, such as the bending stiffness and moments and fracture toughness, will be lower in ALS SOD1G93Amice compared to their littermate controls."

However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.\nSubject terms:\nExperimental models of disease, Physiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionBy providing a sustained mechanical load, gravity is crucial for the maintenance and health of the musculoskeletal system. Microgravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.1–3For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30% after 3 weeks in microgravity,4and femoral bone strength declines by ~2% for every 100 days in space.5,6But the most important consequences lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth and are subjected to standard gravity; indeed, the dramatic decrease in muscle size, strength, and endurance7produces long-term consequences including chronic muscle fatigue and persistent low back pain.8,9While considerable information has been gathered concerning the physiological adaptations of the human body to weightlessness,10,11long-term studies are rare and longitudinal assessments remain limited due to the difficulty to obtain muscle biopsy data on astronauts in-flight. For this reason, researchers have relied on several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading (HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has been established as the standard approach12,13for ground-based research. However, this model puts considerable stress on the rat tail, which can lead to blood flow restriction, inflammation, and necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable to investigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encountered when astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38% of Earth gravity, or 0.38×g) and the Moon (16% of Earth gravity, or 0.16×g), or when they are exposed to artificial gravity induced by continuous centrifugation.14An innovative partial weight-bearing (PWB) model, incorporating a tail-suspension and body harness, has been developed in mice, allowing normal activity for up to 3 weeks at several different levels of PWB.15,16However, rats are generally considered a better animal model for spaceflight studies since their physiological processes, including drug metabolism, are considered more analogous to those of humans.17Accordingly, we recently modified this mouse PWB model for rats18by substituting a pelvic harness for the tail suspension, thereby providing a less stressful experience with improved reliability.In the present study, we sought to extend our initial18work for up to 4 weeks and assessed the functional muscle alterations that occur in three different PWB levels (70%, 40%, and 20% of normal loading). Additionally, we harvested muscle tissues on days 7, 14, and 28 to obtain a comprehensive timeline of muscle atrophy at these different levels of PWB. By doing so, we can provide a detailed picture of the muscle alterations induced by a reduction of the mechanical load. This longitudinal study provides the first step for better understanding the impact of space missions in which stays on the Moon and Mars are planned."

More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (\nn\n= 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.\nSubject terms:\nExperimental models of disease, Preclinical research",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionReduction in mechanical loading occurs in many settings, including cast immobilization, extended bed rest, neuromuscular disorders, spinal cord injury, and spaceflight. Though dependent on the duration and extent of unloading, these reductions in mechanical loading lead to marked skeletal fragility, with reported loss of bone mineral density (BMD) ranging from 10 to 40%1–5. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies to mitigate bone loss associated with reduction in mechanical loading. Such strategies would be best informed by a better understanding of the nature of disuse-induced bone loss.Animal models of reduced mechanical loading have been used to characterize bone loss and evaluate interventions designed to prevent the deleterious effects of unloading. These models include hindlimb unloading, cast immobilization, botulinum toxin administration, and nerve injury6–10. While effective in reflecting the musculoskeletal changes that occur with complete immobilization or unloading, these models are limited in their ability to assess musculoskeletal changes due to partial reductions in mechanical loading that occur in many situations. For example, there is an increased risk of fracture associated with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke11–13, where patients are partially loaded. Furthermore, an animal model that could mimic the musculoskeletal effects of fractional gravity, such as that experienced on the Moon or Mars, could provide insights useful for planning future space missions.To address this gap in knowledge, we had previously developed a partial weight-bearing (PWB) mouse model, and demonstrated the degree of skeletal deterioration to be closely related to the magnitude of unloading14,15. We recently expanded this PWB model to rats, which again showed dose-dependent loss of bone and muscle by varied reductions in weight bearing16–19. In the current study, we aimed to extend this work with a comprehensive evaluation of the time course of changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength following exposure to varied weight-bearing levels in adult rats. We also incorporated histomorphometric measurements to delineate the effects of PWB on bone metabolism at the cellular level. We hypothesized that partial reductions in mechanical loading will lead to proportional, progressive deteriorations in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength driven by increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation."

Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight was once viewed as rare and exceptional but is now widely used by scientists and has attracted private investors and companies, thus democratizing space and microgravity. Data gathered from astronauts onboard the Soyuz, space shuttles or Mir missions and the International Space Station (ISS) have been crucial for understanding the consequences of microgravity in space, and upon return on Earth [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Decades of research have established dramatic physiological changes as result of exposure to microgravity to spaceflight, including: reduced muscular mass and strength [7], reduced bone mineral density [8], cardiovascular complications, as well as others [9,10]. Upon returning to Earth, these adaptations can dramatically influence astronaut health and quality of life. Therefore, ground-based models are necessary to understand the full scope of microgravity-induced pathologies as well as interventions to mitigate these while in space.For centuries, scientists have used animals to better discriminate between physiological and pathological states and investigate human-related diseases and conditions [11,12]. Although Yuri Gagarin was the first human in space, he was preceded by many animals that helped assess risks, feasibility, and outcomes [13,14]. While several species have been flown in space and each can bring valuable information, space missions can be highly restrictive and not easily allow for longitudinal assessments or controlled variables.As more information was needed to better understand and mitigate astronauts/cosmonauts deconditioning when exposed to microgravity, and ensure their safety after their mission, scientists needed to establish a ground-based model to mimic microgravity and unravel the risks and consequences. Rodents have long been the preferred preclinical model for biomedical research both in space and on Earth [15], and in 1979, Morey described the first model of rat hindlimb unloading (HU) [16], which is now the gold-standard to explore the physiological response to mechanical unloading, an analog model of microgravity. While decades of research into unloading-induced alterations to physiological systems have provided invaluable data on microgravity-induced aberrations to physiology, the standard HU model does not account for the variations of gravity inherent to different astronomical settings, such as the Moon or Mars.Artemis missions are set to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon in 2024. These missions will set the stage for a lunar base and serve as a stepping-stone for an eventual crewed-exploration to Mars [17,18]. Therefore, to thoroughly prepare for this endeavor, there is an urge to study gravity as a continuum, and develop models mimicking partial gravity environments. The first attempt at simulating partial gravity on earth was attempted in 2010, with Moon (0.16g) or Mars (0.38g) gravitational loads in female mice [19]. However, inbred mice may be too homogenous to have the desired transferability to human physiology in different gravitational environments. Recently, this model has been adapted to outbred rats in order to better understand the individual variations in response to partial reductions in mechanical loading [20]. Therefore the purpose of this review is to summarize the methodology and utility of this rat partial weight bearing (PWB) model in relation to human physiology, summarize what is currently known on the musculoskeletal effects of partial gravity environments, and provide future directions for the use of this model as it relates to spaceflight and physiology."

        "Title": "Hindlimb suspension in Wistar rats: Sex-based differences in muscle response",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nGround‐based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading\np\n= 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading\np\n= 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.\nKeywords:\nground‐based, microgravity, muscle, sex‐based, spaceflight",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nLiquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies of\nCaenorhabditis elegans\n. However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P\n0\nworms on agar plates, F\n1\nin liquid cultures, and F\n2\nback on agar plates.\nResults\nSignificant variations were found in the gene expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains in response to liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated that 8–34% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses are transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions for genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interactions, we identified that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive responses. Functional analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For example, the N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid cultivation.

        "Title": "Transcriptomic Signature of the Simulated Microgravity Response in Caenorhabditis elegans and Comparison to Spaceflight Experiments.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nGiven the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nto simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSignificant efforts are being made for the human exploration of space. It is known that space conditions can negatively affect biological processes by causing bone loss, muscle atrophy, and immune system impairment, to name a few examples (reviewed in [1,2]). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these adverse effects is largely unknown.Microgravity is one of the major stress factors causing detrimental health effects on humans (reviewed in [3]). Simulation of microgravity is a cost-effective way to study the impact of microgravity on biological systems. For this purpose, various platforms including drop towers, parabolic flights and space flights are available. Because of their advantages to enable long term simulations in an effective and economical manner, clinostats are widely preferred to study gravitational response in biological systems, mainly plants, for decades [4,5,6,7,8]. Clinostats rotate a sample around a horizontal axis, thereby exposing the sample to a rotating gravitational vector. This can reduce and even possibly remove gravitational bias in the development of an organism [6,9,10,11,12,13].C. elegansis an exceptional model organism for space biology studies [14] with its completely documented cell lineage, high reproduction rate, short lifespan, and high similarity to the human genome (reviewed in [15]). The usage of this organism in previous space missions (such as InternationalC. elegansExperiment in Space (ICE-First),C. elegansRNAi space experiment (CERISE), Shenzhou-8, and Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert-01 (CSI-01)) have provided valuable insights into the biological response ofC. elegansto space conditions [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, these studies generally have utilized different strains and liquid cultures instead of commonly used OP50-seeded agar plates to reduce the impact of surface tension [25]. We previously have shown that the usage of different liquid cultures and strains cause highly distinct intergenerational transcriptomic and phenotypical responses [26]. Similarly, a recent study reported dramatical intergenerational changes in the physiology of liquid-grown worms [27]. Thus, complementary to the spaceflight studies, separate investigations can provide insight into the impact of individual space conditions on biological processes.This study investigates the effect of simulated microgravity and the sustained impacts after return to ground conditions onC. eleganstranscriptome. Through the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry analyses, we reveal the downregulation of the sphingolipid signaling pathway under simulated microgravity. In addition, we identify a putative microgravity-responsive transcriptomic signature by comparing our results with previous studies."

        "Title": "Enabling clonal analyses of yeast in outer space by encapsulation and desiccation in hollow microparticles.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nStudying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\nyeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.\nKeywords:\nsingle-cell analysis,\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, space biology, microfluidics, cell encapsulation, microbes, preservation, hydrogel",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMicroorganisms are studied in outer space for numerous reasons, including biotechnology development, model organism studies, and pathogen research. As an example of biotechnology development, the BioNutrients missions on the International Space Station (ISS) aim to use engineeredSaccharomyces cerevisiaeand other microbes for the on-demand production of nutrients to be consumed by astronauts on long, deep-space missions [1,2]; the ISS BioRock experiment studied the ability of three microorganisms (Sphingomonas desiccabilis,Bacillus subtilis, andCupriavidus metallidurans) to aid the biomining of vanadium for in situ resource utilization [3,4]; on the Moonshot Artemis-1 payload,Chlamydomonas reinhardtiialgae will be grown during transit around the Moon and screened for high producers of lipids and hydrogen [5]. For model organism research, the BioSentinel Artemis-1 CubeSat will expose wild-type and mutantS. cerevisiaeto galactic cosmic radiation and assays for metabolism and growth to better understand the biological response to deep-space radiation [6,7]. For pathogenesis research, the EcAMSat CubeSat used a pathogenic strain ofEscherichia colito evaluate whether microgravity affects antibiotic resistance in low Earth orbit [8]. In each example, microorganisms are studied as a bulk population, with each sample made up of data obtained from thousands of cells concurrently. Thus, measurements represent the averaged behavior of all cells in a sample, which can mask diverse phenotypic properties of individual cells or subpopulations [9,10]. Furthermore, each example relies on no more than 16 bulk samples per condition or timepoint. Single-cell analysis methods, in contrast, enable high-throughput characterizations of hundreds of thousands to millions of individual cells in the population, allowing the identification of subpopulations and rare individual cells.There are numerous tools for analyzing and manipulating single cells, each with their own applications and limitations. Two well-established single-cell tools are flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which can characterize and sort single cells by cell size and/or presence of a fluorescent marker [11]. However, these tools are unable to characterize time-dependent phenotypes such as growth rates of clonal colonies, the cell cycle, or pathogenesis. Additionally, the analysis of cell secretions with FACS is limited, requiring additional steps such as conjugating antibodies to the cell surface, where there can be cross talk between cells without additional precautionary steps [12,13].Partitioning single cells into uniform-volume compartments addresses these limitations, essentially isolating each cell in its own test tube. Standard high-throughput microwell plates have 96, 384 or even 1536 wells, but these ultimately have limited throughput when compared to high-throughput microfluidic technologies such as water-in-oil droplet emulsions, which can be used to characterize over 100,000 cells per screen [14]. However, many applications using water-in-oil droplets require microfluidically co-encapsulating multiple reagents, such as hydrogel beads for barcoding or secretion binding, increasing the number of encapsulation steps and/or reducing the percentage of droplets containing all reagents. Additionally, the lack of continuous solution exchange in water-in-oil droplets limits the replenishment of nutrients and the elimination of cellular wastes, limiting the growth potential of encapsulated cells [15,16]. A similar approach uses solid hydrogel microparticles (e.g., gel microdrops), but the polymer mesh can interfere with assays, especially those involving genomic DNA [16]. In addition, gel microdrops can limit the growth of microbes in the microparticle and can be degraded prematurely by proteases and amylases released by the encapsulated microbes [17].A more advanced method combines droplets and microparticles into hydrogel microparticles where an open cavity in the particle captures an aqueous droplet containing a single cell (e.g., nanovials). The hydrogel provides a surface for binding and detecting secretions, similarly to a hydrogel bead in a droplet, while avoiding the co-encapsulation step required for beads [18,19]. However, keeping bound cells from dislodging during long assay or growth protocols and changes in the droplet solution remains challenging. Furthermore, many microbial experiments in space, including BioNutrients, BioRock, and BioSentinel, desiccate their microorganisms prior to launch to increase long-term stabilities and to control microbe metabolic activation via rehydration [1,4,20]. Encapsulating or loading rehydrated cells into water-in-oil droplets or nanovials in space would be an additional hurdle in translating these single-cell analyses to space biology research.The alternative proposed here is fully closed hollow-shell hydrogel microparticles, or PicoShells, which can be desiccated with single microbes pre-encapsulated inside. PicoShells have a thin hydrogel shell around a hollow, aqueous core, where single cells can be encapsulated. The fully closed geometry traps the cell and its progeny inside the particle core, eliminating the need to emulsify in oil. Additionally, the hydrogel shell is porous, enabling a continuous exchange of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents with the external environment without needing to destabilize the particle’s structure. The continuous replenishment of nutrients and the elimination of cellular wastes in the particle core allow uninhibited cell growth, more faithfully replicating suspension culture growth conditions and enabling the study of time-dependent phenotypes over days rather than only fast cellular responses. Meanwhile, the diffusion of assay reagents allows solution changes for multi-step assays (i.e., single-cell PCR or ELISA) or even multiple sequential assays on the same cells [15,16]. The hydrogel shell also provides a surface to conjugate various desired functional groups such as capture antibodies. Finally, PicoShells are compatible with fluorescent-activated cell sorters (FACS) such that PicoShells containing single cells or colonies can be selected based on more complex phenotypes than non-encapsulated cells. Compatibility with liquid handling and flow sorting enables the automation of assay processes to reduce crew hands-on time or to enable use in uncrewed autonomous missions such as CubeSats.Here, we develop a method to desiccate PicoShells with encapsulated singleS. cerevisiaecells that maintains particle morphology and yeast health after storage and rehydration. Our work builds on the foundation set by van Zee et al., 2022, which introduced the PicoShell technology. Our method renders hollow-shell microparticle single-cell analyses more feasible for future space biology missions that use desiccation-tolerant microbes.S. cerevisiaeis an ideal proof-of-concept microbe as it is desiccation-tolerant, a model organism, and a useful species for biotechnology applications. Furthermore,S. cerevisiaehas been used in prior spaceflight missions such as BioNutrients and BioSentinel. Meanwhile, solid hydrogel microparticles, without voids or encapsulated cells, have been desiccated and rehydrated in oil with surfactant while maintaining a morphology similar to that pre-desiccation [21]. We apply this desiccation strategy to PicoShells withS. cerevisiae, desiccating particles in Novec oil with Pico-Surf surfactant under vacuum. We evaluate particle integrity via particle durability, morphology, and porosity of the hydrogel shell, and we evaluate yeast health via viability and growth potential. We further show a proof-of-concept growth-based single-cell assay on rehydrated particles."

        "Abstract": "Graphical abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSince Yuri Gagarin first traveled to space in 1961, human spaceflight activity has grown rapidly. One of the most notable events to date was the 1998 launch of the International Space Station (ISS), a lower Earth orbiting research platform, which allows astronauts to live and work in space for up to a year at a time.1The microgravity environment of space presents an extreme environmental stressor, which induces a multitude of physiological maladaptations including, but not limited to, skeletal muscle and bone loss, cardiovascular decline, immune compromise,2neuronal damage, and decreased gray matter volume.3These resemble some of the adverse health changes associated with chronological aging on Earth, and additionally serve as an accelerated model of other non-communicable health concerns such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.4As people look to travel further into space and for longer periods than ever before—owing to the rise in commercial spaceflight and increasingly lower cost access to space—understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of spaceflight-induced maladaptation is essential to developing effective countermeasures that promote safe space travel and also benefit health on Earth.Human and rodent studies have provided invaluable insight into the mechanistic regulation of the microgravity phenotype; however, they are limited by significant operational (e.g., crew time, human/rodent numbers, and sample feasibility) and economical (e.g., high costs) constraints.5,6Alternative model organisms are, therefore, required to achieve the experimental power necessary to draw conclusions on the causes of space-induced health decline.Caenorhabditis elegans(C. elegans) is a non-parasitic, microscopic (∼0.25–1 mm) nematode characterized by a short lifespan (∼3 weeks), large brood size, fully sequenced genome, multiple evolutionary conserved mechanisms, ease of culture, and low expense,7presenting a primary biologically relevant model for spaceflight research that is relatively cheap and feasible. In fact,C. elegansspaceflight experiments have been conducted since the time of the space shuttle. Previous studies have shown thatC. eleganscan mate, reproduce, and undergo embryonic development during spaceflight, and they are also susceptible to radiation-induced mutations during spaceflight.8,9However, since these experiments were performed on ordinary agar medium, the effects of strong hydrostatic pressure adhesion between theC. elegansand the agar surface could not be ruled out. Therefore, in examining the effects of microgravity, a liquid culture was devised. The first space experiment to test the difference between liquid and agar media could not be analyzed due to an unforeseen accident on Columbia’s return. However, theC. eleganswere found alive a few days later, protected by a sturdy container.10Since then, our space experiments have been conducted using CeMM (C. elegansMaintenance Medium)11andE. coliOP-50 liquid media. In addition,C. eleganspermit the use of genetic and molecular tools (e.g., genetic mutants), to dissect specific biological pathways and trial emerging countermeasures, such as the efficacy of preclinical drugs.12SinceC. elegansdisplay high molecular, metabolic, and physiologic orthology with people, with as much as 83% of theC. elegansproteome sharing homologous genes with humans,13they serve as efficient model organisms to understand (human) disease processes. For example, their use as a biomedical research model organism has been invaluable in the study of Alzheimer disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.14Specific to spaceflight,C. eleganssuccessfully live in microgravity15and display reduced movement capacity,16analogous to the decline in muscle function observed in astronauts post-flight,17demonstrating the suitability ofC. elegansas a model organism to study the effects of spaceflight on physiology. Therefore, usingC. elegansto uncover the precise molecular mechanisms regulating adaptations to microgravity can significantly accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological decline in humans.Recently, there has been an exponential increase in the use of “omics” technologies and informatic tools to probe the etiology of, and develop countermeasures for, pathological states,18including spaceflight.19The application of omics seeks to establish the sum of the parts within a biological system, rather than identifying individual components, promoting a holistic rather than reductive path of biological study.20In addition to the beneficial “systems biology” approach, omics can capitalize on pre-existing biological samples (i.e., samples that were collected before the omics “boom” and “bio-banked” samples), which are particularly rare in the context of spaceflight. Recently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched project “GeneLab” to allow free and unrestricted access to omics data from spaceflight experiments to researchers all over the globe.21The success of this open-science model has maximized the use of scarce spaceflight biological samples and led to several discoveries otherwise not possible, such as the identification of spaceflight CO2levels as a confounding variable in the animal enclosure modules used in rodent experiments.22More recently, the European Space Agency (ESA)-funded Space Omics Topical Team has supported new and ongoing ESA scientific community activities that focus on the application and exploitation of omics research in space.23,24Indeed, omics technology has been applied to spaceflight research usingC. elegans, leading to a more complete understanding of biological processes that occur in response to spaceflight, although these works remain to be consolidated.The aim of this narrative review is, therefore, to summarize the literature pertaining to the use ofC. elegansas a model organism for spaceflight-related research with a specific focus on publications that have applied omics technologies to uncover the mechanistic basis of the microgravity phenotype, thus highlighting how the extensive use ofC. elegansin spaceflight research has constructed a more coherent picture of the biological response to spaceflight. To do this, we provide an overview of the available omics literature, including hyper-, micro-, and simulated gravity scenarios, highlighting key biological themes and, where relevant, highlight how the molecular flight-responsive signatures in worms correspond with known molecular and/or functional adaptations reported in higher animals and humans. We also summarize the impact of theC. elegansspace omics literature to date and highlight what we believe are the next frontiers inC. elegansspace omics research. Although previous reviews have appreciated the use ofC. elegansas a model organism for spaceflight research, these reviews have either not focused on omics25or are non-comprehensive due to geographical constraints.24Thus, global efforts combiningC. elegansand omics in space remain to be detailed."

In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (\nNfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α\n) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.",

We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice.

The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.\nSubject terms:\nPharmaceutics, Bone",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAlterations in the gravity vector and exposure to ionizing radiation can disrupt skeletal homeostasis in mice1–3. There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss4–6. Decrements in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in astronauts from the Mir missions as well as missions to the International Space Station (ISS)7–9. While much research has focused on the detrimental effects of microgravity on skeletal tissue, less is known about the impact of spaceflight radiation. Crewed missions have, to this point, primarily remained within low-Earth orbit (LEO). While sources of ionizing space radiation within LEO include galactic cosmic radiation and charged particles from unpredictable solar particle events (SPE)10,11, the presence of the Earth’s magnetosphere reduces exposure to ionizing space radiation. Missions beyond LEO pose the greatest risk of radiation exposure and is of significant concern for crew health12–14. Spaceflight-relevant radiation includes a mix of low-linear energy transfer (LET) species such as protons and helium ions as well as high-LET species such as iron15,16. Beyond LEO, for example, astronauts may be exposed to up to 0.7 Sv of ionizing radiation12,15,17during a multi-year mission to the Moon or Mars14,15,18.On Earth, bone homeostasis is effectively maintained by the controlled remodeling activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, exposure to low-LET radiation (137Cs or X-ray, 1–2 Gy) leads to a transient increase in the number of osteoclasts, accompanied by an increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and decrease in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), overall leading to a reduction in bone volume fraction (BV/TV)19–22. Together, this early increase in bone resorption and decrease in bone formation due to radiation exposure can result in a state of osteopenia, potentially leading to an increased risk of bone fracture16,23,24. A possible mechanism of action responsible for these changes in bone homeostasis is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to radiation exposure2,25. Furthermore, reduction of antioxidant defense mechanisms26,27and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines16,28have been associated with altered redox-balance due to radiation exposure. Together, these critical changes in cellular signaling lead to compromised bone strength and increased fracture risk25,29. Due to the involvement of redox-signaling in radiation-induced bone loss, antioxidants have been considered as candidate countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced bone loss30. Proposed mechanisms by which antioxidants exert protective effects include the quenching of ROS via an increase in antioxidant activity and decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling cascades29.Dried plum,Prunus domestica L., has been shown to have beneficial effects against bone loss31(reviewed in Wallaceet al. 2017). Dried plum’s positive effects on bone health markers have been investigated in multiple models of osteopenia, in both human clinical trials32–36and rodent studies37,38. While the mechanism of action of dried plum is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that the high antioxidant capacity and high polyphenolic content of this fruit scavenges free-radicals as well as promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption39–42. Our lab has reported that mice fed a diet composed of Dried Plum (DP) prevented cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation (IR), both low-LET such as gamma (137Cs) and a mixture of both low-LET and high-LET (sequential beam of proton,1H and iron,56Fe). The proposed mechanism for DP’s protective effect is via the prevention of radiation-induced increases in markers of bone resorption, inflammation and oxidative stress43.Since the spaceflight environment includes exposure to both IR and microgravity, we sought to extend our hypothesis that DP could be a countermeasure for both radiation- and microgravity-induced bone loss. The current literature indicates that simulated microgravity and IR each have detrimental effects on cancellous bone structure, although there is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and IR cause additive or synergistic effects when combined20,44,45. Thus, more studies are needed to determine whether combining simulated microgravity and IR leads to cumulative effects compared to simulated microgravity and IR alone. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents46. This model allows for a simulation of the cephalad fluid shift47and removal of load-bearing forces typically experienced by the hindlimbs, which can lead to increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and decreased numbers of bone-forming osteoblasts48. Together, these events result in bone loss as well as reduced bone mechanical properties in rodents49–52. In addition, exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors53,54. The bone marrow niche contains osteoblast progenitors cells4and it has been shown that exposure to microgravity alters the cells proliferation capacity and impairs their ability to produce extracellular matrix, in turn inhibiting the maturation of the bone matrix. Thus, the ability to maintain bone homeostasis is diminished16,54–56.To address these knowledge gaps related to spaceflight-induced bone loss and candidate countermeasures, we sought to evaluate the potentially distinct effects of microgravity and ionizing radiation when applied independently, or in combination. For this study, we utilized the HU model and exposure to total body irradiation (137Cs gamma radiation, at 2 Gy dose) as analogs of weightlessness and radiation exposure, respectively. A relatively high dose of radiation (2 Gy) was chosen as a positive control dose to ensure bone loss in rodents and to allow for testing of DP as a countermeasure, as previously described43. We sought to determine whether DP diet prevents simulated microgravity-induced bone loss alone, and in combination with radiation, as compared to respective control diet controls. We also assessed the ability of DP to mitigate simulated weightlessness- and/or radiation-induced changes to the axial skeleton57, specifically the lumbar 4 (L4) vertebrae. We analyzed both cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. Additionally, we determined whether the DP diet had the capacity to protect osteoprogenitors after exposure to simulated microgravity, an essential part in the healthy maintenance of skeletal tissue."

        "Title": "Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMicrogravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.\nKeywords:\nhindlimb unloading, microgravity, cardiovascular system, immune response, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks.The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19].Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 800 million individuals globally1. It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months2. Historically, the management of CKD primarily focused on delaying renal failure, implementing end-stage dialysis, or pursuing renal transplantation3. However, recent advancements in the field have led researchers to explore pharmacological interventions, such as empagliflozin, which has shown promise in decelerating CKD progression and mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with the condition4. Despite advancements in medical research, effective treatments for CKD remain elusive. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD treatment are imperative.Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence gene expression levels, present a promising avenue for this endeavor. Utilizing MR analysis of druggable genes, cis-eQTLs—SNPs located in the proximal genomic regions of target genes and closely associated with their expression—serve as instrumental variables (IVs) to elucidate causal relationships between druggable genes and CKD. This approach facilitates the identification of potential drug targets for CKD treatment. This approach has also found extensive application in the investigation of various other diseases5–7.Mendelian Randomization (MR), a statistical technique that leverages genetic variation as an instrumental variable, has demonstrated significant potential in recent years for causal inference in the context of complex diseases8. By utilizing genetic variants that exhibit strong correlations with exposure factors as IVs, MR facilitates the assessment of causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding variables. Consequently, MR analyses is frequently employed to evaluate etiological inferences in epidemiological research9,10. Importantly, the effectiveness of MR analyses parallels that of randomized controlled trials, albeit with reduced bias and the elimination of reverse causality (Fig.1)11.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabThe principle of Mendelian randomization analysis is shown in the figure, where instrumental variables can represent exposure (druggable gene), are independent of confounding factors, and do not directly affect outcomes (Chronic kidney disease)."

        "Title": "A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPlatelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for\nn\nuclear\na\nssembly\np\nrotein\n1\nl\nike\n1\n(NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34\n+\n-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.\nKeywords:\nco-immunoprecipitation, DLAT, ODP2, PDC-E2, megakaryocytes, NAP1L1, overexpression, platelets, protein interactions, sepsis",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMegakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [1] and lungs [2], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [3,4,5]. The development and maturation of MKs and the subsequent production of PLTs by MKs are tightly regulated and depend on external cues [6,7,8]. During the final stages of MK development, the cytoplasm is massively reorganized and long cytoplasmic extensions are formed, coined proplatelets [9]. Two cytoskeletal systems provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation: actin filaments and microtubules assembled from tubulin subunits [10,11]. More specifically, it was demonstrated that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. In this context, it is important to note that such processes are strictly dependent on sufficient availability of ATP as an energy source [12].Once released into the circulation, PLTs impose as small, and anucleate cells. In the past, PLTs have traditionally been considered simple ‘sacs of glue’ with limited functionality beyond acute hemostasis due to the lack of a cell nucleus. However, in recent years, PLTs have been identified as dynamic effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum [6,7,8,13,14,15,16]. One mechanism explaining the multitude of functional responses is that MKs are equipped to sense external stimuli that trigger differential expression and packaging of mRNA and proteins into their progeny, causing distinct PLT functional alterations, especially in disease [6,7,8,17,18,19,20,21]. Hence, although PLTs are anucleate, we found that the PLTs’ array of mRNAs is dynamic and can undergo active re-programming [8,17,18,19]. Furthermore, intricate processes regulate RNA processing, expression, and translational events [22,23,24,25,26,27,28] in PLTs. In concert with maintaining nuclear RNA processing capabilities, numerous studies have shown that PLTs possess nuclear proteins, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) [29,30], and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) [28,31].Sepsis is a common, and often morbid, syndrome which is characterized by systemic inflammation and dysregulated host immune responses triggered by invading pathogens or toxins (i.e., Toll-like receptor [TLR] agonists like LPS), frequently intensified by injurious agonists generated by the infected organism. The MK-PLT axis plays a major role in orchestrating sepsis-related thromboinflammatory and immunothrombotic events [7,32,33,34,35]. MKs were demonstrated to synergistically react to TLR 2/4 agonists in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling by increasing their proliferation, and thrombopoiesis [36]. However, this effect could only be observed in immature CD34+ cells, while MKs in the past 7 days of culture demonstrated slightly decreasing numbers when treated with LPS. Finally, PLT aggregation and the formation of heterotypic PLT-leukocyte aggregates in septic patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [37,38,39]. Nevertheless, the direct impact of PLTs in the pathobiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, several cell biology aspects, and mechanistic insight into PLT and MK functions during septic events are still obscure.The purification and functional characterization of a 53 kDa protein facilitating nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells was first described in 1984 [40]. The NAP-family, including nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), is a group of proteins with chaperone function, capable of binding histones and coordinating their assemblance into nucleosomal particles [41]. Several additional binding partners for NAP-family members were identified, including transcription factors, proteins regulating nuclear import (karyopherins), and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [41]). Specifically, NAP1L1 was described to promote proliferation of pluripotent stem cells [42] through cell cycle interference. Furthermore, NAP1L1, in concert with NAP1L4, can act as a histone chaperone [43], and serving as a co-factor for ubiquitination client selection [44]. Furthermore, numerous studies describe NAP1L1 as a prognostic marker in select cancer entities (i.e., colon cancer [45], hepatocellular carcinoma [46], ovarian cancer [47], and lung cancer [48]), and its involvement in a number of signaling pathways, which were demonstrated to result in tumor progression.NAP1L1 mRNA expression in human PLTs was previously described [49]; however, no function was assigned to this versatile nuclear protein in such anucleate cells, or its progenitors, MKs. Here, we demonstrate that MKs and human PLTs endogenously express differential NAP1L1 mRNA variants and protein isoforms. We identified PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex), as a protein interaction partner. In PLTs, septic conditions induced increased expression of NAP1L1 protein, and PDH complex activity. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs resulted in reduced proplatelet formation, and decreased PDH complex activity when treated with LPS, simulating a septic environment. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified NAP1L1 interaction partner in human PLTs and MKs. Furthermore, this newly described protein–protein interaction seems to influence PDH complex activity, with subsequent functional disturbances of these specialized cells."

        "Title": "Evaluation of rodent spaceflight in the NASA animal enclosure module for an extended operational period (up to 35 days)",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRodent models have played an integral role in the spaceflight program by permitting the collection of physiological data in support of human space exploration.1The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) to conduct the rodent spaceflight research on board the Space Shuttle and since its development, the AEM has been used successfully in over 26 rodent spaceflights2–10with the latest one on STS-135 on 8 July 2011. Because rodent models for spaceflight missions have provided critical data in support of human space exploration, great efforts have been committed to continue the rodent flight payloads beyond the Space Shuttle era. When using the shuttle as the vehicle, the flight duration for AEM was expected to be <20 days. Now new flight payload scenarios have been developed which will require the AEM to be used with minimal modification to continue the rodent flight for 30 days with an additional margin of 5 days for flight preparation for other types of flight vehicles (e.g., Russian Bion-M free flyer).Potential operational limiting factors for the AEM, which could theoretically bar use for longer duration flights, have been outlined in previous publications11,12and include the waste handling system, odor containing capability, and food and water supplies within the unit. With NASA’s growing push for longer duration crewed flights, there is also an increased importance placed on long-term studies of model organisms as a pre-requisite, despite existing outside the scope of the hardware originally designed for short duration travel. Therefore, a study of the durability of the hardware beyond the original design for short term Space Shuttle flights is required before application on the International Space Station and is the basis for this research, while also determining if other potential limiting factors exist when food and water can be replenished. Follow-up studies designed to test the AEM hardware life support functionality and durability are still needed beyond 35 days because these were outside of the scope of this initial investigation into the proof of concept as outlined by NASA headquarters’ science requirements (unpublished). On the basis of the food and water data from previous flight and ground studies (unpublished), the nutrient-upgraded rodent food bar (NuRFB) and water content in the unit is enough for 12 mice to reach the 35 day duration. Therefore, this study was designed to test whether the AEM, with minimal modifications, could be used for up to 35 days to support mice growth with a focus on the water handling system. Because external replenishment of NuRFB and water is easily administered to the AEM, it is outside of the current AEM hardware requirements to contain enough for a 35-day study with five rats, so we instead investigated whether the waste handling, air circulation, and lighting, and other hardware systems could support five rats for 35 days if the AEM were supplemented with the required food and water to determine which, if any, life support system existed as a limiting factor for use of the AEM for up to 35 days.These studies exist as important ground based controls in order to demonstrate the absence of a ‘cage effect’ due to the AEM when compared with vivarium-housed animals and to establish an AEM baseline in the observed parameters after containment for 35 days, although it is still recommended (and in most cases required and supported by NASA) to house spaceflight control animals in grounded AEM."

        "Title": "Morphology of Penicillium rubens Biofilms Formed in Space",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nFungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including\nPenicillium rubens\n, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of\nP. rubens\nto the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity,\nPenicillium chrysogenum\n, fungal biofilm, International Space Station, microscopy, spacecraft",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBiofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general [1]. For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations [2]. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form [3], and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal [4].One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell–surface and cell–cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development [5]. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion [6,7]. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material.Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts [8]. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on “piping and equipment behind the panels” [8]. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which “holes” on the insulation tape were observed [8]. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenumnow calledPenicillium rubens[9]) started growing on windows’ rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were “zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates” on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over “cold” material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as “white powder”, sometimes “the size of a football” [8]. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS),Penicilliumhas been the most isolated genus of fungi [10]. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity [11].The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell–cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells [1,12], and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections [3]. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin [3], resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention [4] and translate into high mortality rates [3]. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections [4]. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections, [13], particularly among the immunocompromised [14], posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response [15] and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure [16,17]. Particularly,Penicillium rubenshas been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals [18,19,20].While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth–Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars [21]. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space [22,23,24,25], little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies [26,27,28]. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics ofP. rubensbiofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraft- and nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment [9] and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project [29,30,31]. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development."

        "Title": "Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.\nSubject terms:\nMolecular biology, Mathematics and computing",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMuscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight1,2. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset.It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump’s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2+during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3.With respect to Ca2+handling, recent work has shown that during spaceflight, Ca2+uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types1. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca2+reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca2+handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, it is possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation.Machine learning (ML) methods are particularly effective in identifying patterns in complex biological data, particularly for discovering biomarkers in heterogeneous, high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets4. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML methods are also less prone to distribution-specific effects5, making them a promising alternative to classic systems biology. This is particularly important for space biological research, where small datasets are often combined to increase statistical power.In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been flown in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied to this scientific question before.When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainability/interpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks, are seen as “black boxes” due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance but rather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relationships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely overfit models when trained on HDLSS data6.With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice, developed by Abzu ApS7,8. Symbolic regression attempts to find the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features’ relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely to overfit. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for these computational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efficiently to find concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery9.We aimed to identify molecular drivers of spaceflight effects on muscle physiology using spaceflight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) with omics data found in GeneLab10,11and Ca2+reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)12. First, we trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of spaceflight and ground control mice using multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regression task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from spaceflight or ground control mice, a classification task. We then identified features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model’s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers that may provide mechanistic insight behind the spaceflight-induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.\nSubject terms:\nPhage biology, Bacteriophages, Microbial ecology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHuman space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the emergence of commercial space tourism is redefining the risks associated with space travel. Adverse health effects due to host-microorganism interactions is acknowledged by the NASA Human Research Program, and currently this risk is accepted for short duration spaceflight. However, as flight durations increase and the population that experiences spaceflight expands beyond professional astronauts, it is of increasing importance to understand the interplay between microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, ionizing radiation, altered host-microbe interactions, etc.) and human health.Microorganisms on the International Space Station (ISS) are undergoing adaptation and host-mediated propagation throughout the environment1–3. Studies to date suggest microbes on the ISS, predominantly derived from the crew microbiome, are enriched in functions related to metal ion tolerance, dormancy, and antibiotic resistance3,4. A primary mechanism by which bacteria adapt to novel environments and stress is through genome plasticity, the ability to uptake exogenous genetic material5. The presence of temperate bacteriophages, or prophages, in bacterial genomes is one of the main factors that enable genome plasticity6. The entrance of a phage into a bacterial genome is performed through the process of lysogeny, forming a “dormant” prophage containing the entirety of the bacteriophage DNA that is not actively bactericidal, but can undergo replication into a mature virus. These prophages can remain dormant for extended periods of time, or switch into their active (lytic) state, typically after intense DNA damage. Lytic phages can become bactericidal and infect other bacterial cells, taking either their lytic or lysogenic state in their new host7.Prophages dramatically alter their host’s physiology. The presence of prophages can disrupt and silence bacterial genes, and they can cause chromosomal rearrangements, leading to changes in gene expression in their bacterial host. Prophages can confer host immunity to other bacteriophages, preventing lytic attack8. During the transition to the lytic state, prophages can copy adjacent bacterial genes, integrating them into the viral genome. This genetic material is transferred to new bacterial hosts9. Examples of phage transduced functions include virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, toxins, effector proteins, and regulatory proteins8.Prophages also affect microbial populations at the community level. The introduction of bacteriophages into soil samples significantly changed the microbial composition and diversity of the soil microbial community10. In aquatic environments, bacteriophage lyse 20–40% of bacterial biomass per day11. In mouse model studies, both temperate and lytic phages influence the host gut microbiome, with lytic phages leading to a more beneficial community, and temperate phages leading to dysbiosis12.The role of bacteriophage in the adaptation of bacteria to the spaceflight environment is unknown. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of microbial communities in spaceflight, with changes noted in the composition of both the gut and skin microbiomes of astronauts13. While other studies have noted the presence of prophages in a single bacteria species isolated from the ISS14, in this work we show a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and characterization of prophage that inhabit the spacecraft-built environment."

        "Title": "Influence of the spaceflight environment on macrophage lineages",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight and terrestrial spaceflight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review highlights current literature on macrophage responses to spaceflight and spaceflight analogs.\nSubject terms:\nBiomarkers, Immunology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpace exploration and habitation will expose crew members to unique risk factors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity forces, social isolation, and enclosed/hostile environments. In addition, these stressors will be experienced at a substantial distance from Earth, where emergency medical intervention will be limited. Multiple studies on crew health and model organisms have determined spaceflight-associated risks can impact nervous, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems (reviewed in1). Tissue-resident macrophages, circulating blood monocytes, and lymphatic system responses to spaceflight-associated risk factors can influence physiological outcomes in biological systems. Studies performed on space exploration vehicles and on the International Space Station (ISS) have yielded varied findings on immunological patterns, which may be in part due to limitations to onboard sampling and experimental procedures. In general, crew members who have flown in space display altered leukocyte counts and function, as well as chronic low-grade inflammation2–9. Chronic inflammation experienced in-flight may be in response to oxidative damage10(reviewed in11), which may also contribute to accelerated aging described post-flight12,13. However, due the dynamic nature of the immune system, contributions of circadian cycling, epigenetics, and differential response kinetics are only now beginning to be evaluated. Thus, understanding the impact of spaceflight-associated risks on macrophage phenotypes and functions is paramount for astronaut health monitoring and mitigation programs.Macrophages are key elements of the innate immune response and play an important role in antigen removal via phagocytosis. They also direct the adaptive immune response through antigen presentation and lymphocyte immunological synapse formation. In addition, many non-genetic, multisystem terrestrial diseases are caused by aberrant inflammation, which is in part regulated by macrophages (reviewed in14,15).There is a significant knowledge gap in the characterization of macrophage heterogeneity involved in spaceflight-associated dysfunctions, in addition to identifying homeostatic resolution processes. Consequently, teasing apart cell type-specific responses may help characterize distinct immunological processes observed in the spaceflight environment."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionMariner IV was the first successful robotic mission to Mars producing surface photos and preliminary data used to model atmospheric pressure, layer heights, and temperature (Leighton et al., 1965;Binder, 1966;Fjeldbo and Eshleman, 1968). In the half century since that first pioneering mission, orbital and surface rover missions have continued to characterize the Mars environment – generally regarded as hostile to terrestrial life as we know it. The martian surface features highly desiccating conditions as well as extremely low pressure and temperature. Moreover, lacking a substantial atmosphere and with a weak magnetosphere (Acuña et al., 2001), non-ionizing UV radiation (100–400 nm) as well as high energy solar ionizing radiation (X-rays, Gamma rays, etc.) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) bombard the planet’s surface (Kuhn and Atreya, 1979;Simonsen et al., 1990;Saganti et al., 2004;Hellweg and Baumstark-Khan, 2007;Barlow, 2008;Catling, 2009;Hassler et al., 2014;Martínez et al., 2017). With such an extreme radiation environment, from a terrestrial standpoint, the martian surface appears to be biocidal.To ascertain where life can survive beyond Earth, experiments in the fields of space biology and astrobiology have examined the responses of terrestrial model organisms to simulated and real space conditions (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001;Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2016;DasSarma et al., 2020). Understanding microbial adaptations to either isolated and combined extreme environmental stressors helps (i) establish the limits of life on Earth as we know it; (ii) determine whether terrestrial life could survive on Mars; and (iii) refine the search for life in other extraterrestrial habitats (Horneck et al., 2010;Cockell et al., 2016). With the possible exception of the Viking missions, Mars has been unavailable to date for conducting controlled biological experiments; thus, extreme terrestrial analog environments have been widely used to test instrumentation and microbial survival outcomes (Marlow et al., 2008;Fairén et al., 2010;Suedfeld, 2010;West et al., 2010). Typically, martian analog environments are located on Earth’s surface in regions where aridity, temperature extremes, and elevated radiation dominate the landscape. For instance, the McMurdo Dry Valleys in continental Antarctica and high-elevation deserts in Australia and South America are frequently visited, analog destinations (Clarke and Persaud, 2004;Fletcher et al., 2012;López-Lozano et al., 2012;Heldmann et al., 2013;Musilova et al., 2015). However, high above Earth’s surface in the stratosphere (∼15–50 km), another Mars analog environment exists, presenting a unique combination of environmental insults that more closely resemble conditions on the Red Planet. In the middle stratosphere during daytime hours, the following Mars-like factors are simultaneously present: intense, full spectrum ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high energy ionizing radiation (including secondary scattering), desiccation, hypoxia, and ultralow temperatures and pressures (Clark and McCoy, 1965;Potemra and Zmuda, 1970;Vampola and Gorney, 1983;Keating et al., 1987;Clancy and Muhleman, 1993;Von Engeln et al., 1998;Seele and Hartogh, 1999;Shepherd, 2000;Lambert et al., 2007;Mertens et al., 2016;Caro et al., 2019). Taken together, these combined conditions cannot be found naturally anywhere on the surface of the Earth and would be challenging to easily reproduce in laboratory-based experiments.Reaching the middle stratosphere is relatively achievable compared to suborbital and orbital spaceflight investigations. High-altitude scientific balloons have been used for more than eight decades to study the atmosphere and atmospheric phenomena (Winckler et al., 1959;Winckler, 1960;Murcray et al., 1969;Mertens et al., 2016;Caro et al., 2019) and more recently for conducting biological exposure experiments (Stevens, 1936;Simons, 1954;Sullivan and Smith, 1960;Rainwater and Smith, 2004;Beck-Winchatz and Bramble, 2014;Coleman and Mitchell, 2014;Smith et al., 2014;Khodadad et al., 2017;Smith and Sowa, 2017;Pulschen et al., 2018). In this study, we take advantage of a large scientific balloon mission to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) for exposing microorganisms and measuring their survival and metabolic responses while monitoring ionizing radiation levels and other pertinent environmental conditions. Four microorganisms relevant to astrobiology and space biology were flown inside the Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment (MARSBOx) payload. The two bacterial extremophiles,Salinisphaera shabanensisandButtiauxellasp. MASE-IM-9, were included to test the hypothesis that terrestrial microbial strains, isolated from extreme Mars-analog environments, can withstand the stress factors of a martian-like environment. The fungusAspergillus nigerand the bacteriumStaphylococcus capitissubsp.capitiswere included in this study because they are human-associated and opportunistic pathogens, and have both been previously detected on the International Space Station (ISS). Thus, they are likely to travel to Mars in crewed space missions (Novikova et al., 2006;Checinska et al., 2015;Be et al., 2017;Mora et al., 2019;Sobisch et al., 2019). Moreover, spores fromA. nigermight resist space travel on the outside of a spacecraft; therefore, understanding their survival potential in a Mars-like environment is of interest to planetary protection.The MARSBOx design was a balloon-compatible, NASA-adapted version of hardware from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) biological exposure missions EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R aboard the ISS (Rabbow et al., 2009;Rabbow et al., 2012,2015), using the transport and exposure box (Trex-Box) from the European MASE project (Beblo-Vranesevic et al., 2017a). To adjust for Mars atmospheric conditions, the Trex-Box was filled with a Mars gas mixture at 5–10 mbar during the mission. Herein, we report results from the first MARSBOx mission and summarize environmental conditions that collectively indicate the most robust Mars analog."

        "Title": "In situ linkage of fungal and bacterial proliferation to microbiologically influenced corrosion in B20 biodiesel storage tanks.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nRenewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e.,\nin situ\n). To measure\nin situ\nmicrobial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured\nin situ\ncorrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the\nAcetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae\n, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family\nTrichocomaceae\n, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the\nSaccharomycetaceae\nfamily of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the\nTrichocomaceae\nwere correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide (Beiter and Tian, 2016). One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal lipids. Biodiesel is commonly used as a replacement or additive to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) up to 5% v/v to restore lubricity lost due to the removal of sulfur compounds (Steidley and Knothe, 2005;Moser, 2009;Gill et al., 2012). Blends containing up to 20% v/v biodiesel (i.e., B20) can be used without changes to existing engines or infrastructure (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). Combustion of these blends produces reduced nitric oxide emissions, an ozone precursor of concern, than pure biodiesel fuel (Basha et al., 2009). The consumption of biodiesel has increased worldwide over the past 10 years because of its combustion properties (Chang et al., 1996;Canakci, 2007), performance advantages, and increasingly strict emissions regulations (Blakeley, 2012).The advantages offered by blending biodiesel with ULSD are potentially offset by the drawback of lower fuel stability (Lisiecki et al., 2014). Biodiesel contains more dissolved oxygen than ULSD, reducing oxidative stability and increasing the risk of fuel biodegradation (Speidel et al., 2000). Biodiesel is also more hygroscopic than ULSD (Fregolente et al., 2012), causing blends like B20 to absorb and retain more water. Water in fuel represents habitat for microorganisms and is essential for microbial metabolism and growth; water entrained within fuel enables microbiological proliferation, resulting in fouling. Liquid water is denser than fuel and will accumulate at the bottom of any storage vessel. Microorganisms at the fuel-water interface are able to live in an aqueous environment with the fuel as an oxidizable substrate and source of dissolved oxygen (Prince et al., 2008). Fouling (e.g., the accumulation of biomass) is greatest at the fuel-water interface and microbial metabolism quickly depletes any oxygen in the water (Prince et al., 2008;Owsianiak et al., 2009;Bucker et al., 2011;Passman, 2013).Microbial growth and subsequent corrosion are dependent upon fuel chemistry and the amount of water present (Aktas et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2010). Biodiesel and biodiesel blends do not contain free fatty acids by specification, but copious amounts of fatty acids are produced as bi-products of the metabolism of FAME by microorganisms (Aktas et al., 2010;Yassine et al., 2013) that may result in microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of steel tanks or tank components. Polymer tank seals and fittings that are also exposed to organic acids can exhibit decreased ductility and strength. Production of CO2during the microbial metabolism of FAME could also increase the rate of corrosion within a storage tank (Crolet et al., 1999). General production and dissolution of acid and CO2within a fluid can result in uniform corrosion, where the loss of material is distributed across a surface. The accumulation of biofilms results in several possible outcomes including the localized production and concentration of corrosive compounds, the formation of galvanic couples, and the ennoblement of steel surfaces. Any of these would result in localized corrosion that is characterized by deep, penetrating pits on metallic surfaces that represent a great risk to storage tank infrastructure (Lee et al., 2009;Little and Lee, 2014). The link between biodegradation and corrosion has been studied in other petroleum environments such as oil production, drilling (Duncan et al., 2009;Stevenson et al., 2011), or storage of petroleum products in marine environments including biodiesel (Aktas et al., 2010;Lyles et al., 2013) yet noin situstudy exists to this point in B20 storage and distribution systems.For over a decade, the United States Air Force (USAF) has stored B20 biodiesel and used it in non-tactical support vehicles as a component of their Strategic Energy Plan (Blakeley, 2012). The adoption of B20 biodiesel by the USAF, however, correlated with an increase in reports of “bad fuel,” or fouling due to visible particulates in the fuel and clogged filters at dispensers. We hypothesized that the reported fouling was microbiological in origin, rather than from the abiotic production of waxes in fuel that was suspected by fuel operators and reported previously (Tang et al., 2008;Botella et al., 2014). Both fuel fouling and MIC have the potential to impact the operation of B20 biodiesel storage and distribution systems. Pure cultures and enrichments of microorganisms have shown the ability to degrade biodiesel blends (including B20) and induce corrosion under laboratory conditions (Prince et al., 2008;Bucker et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2011) but no studies link the microbial community and its proliferation with corrosion in active storage tanks over time. To this end, we conducted a rare longitudinal study,in situ, of microbial community dynamics linked to the corrosion of steel in B20 biodiesel underground storage tanks (UST). Two USAF locations housing B20 biodiesel tanks with recurrent fuel quality issues were selected for this study. We hypothesized that the reported issues were the result of microbial contamination and predicted that corrosion would be greatest in tanks with the most biomass. We subsequently conducted a 1-year survey of the microbial communities present at both storage locations to link microbiological fouling, fuel degradation, and MICin situwithin each storage tank."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSimple Summary\nEarthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals.\nAbstract\nEarthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.\nKeywords:\npre-earthquake phenomena, positive holes, ULF (ultralow frequency) waves, ELF (extremely low frequency) waves, air ionization, water oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, physiological effects",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionEarthquakes are caused by the build-up of tectonic stresses. When rocks reach a critical limit, catastrophic failure occurs, causing a rupture to propagate, sometimes over distances of hundreds of kilometers, with typical speeds in the range of 2.2–3 km/s—supersonic with respect to the speed of sound in air. The rupture generates shockwaves in the Earth that spread at speeds of about 6 km/s for the compressional (P) waves and about 3.4 km/s for the more destructive shear (S) waves. An earthquake of magnitude 7 releases an energy equivalent to that of more than 2000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs. The magnitude scale being exponential, the energy released by a magnitude 9 earthquake is equivalent to more than 2,000,000 A-bombs.Mainstream seismology, as currently practiced, focuses on understanding earthquakes from a mechanistic viewpoint using information collected by the analysis of past earthquakes to predict future earthquakes [1,2,3]. Unfortunately, even if the database for past events is very large, counting thousands, even tens of thousands, the prediction of any single future earthquake is subject to the large uncertainty, which is an inescapable corollary of statistics of small numbers. For this reason seismological prediction models are typically given with uncertainty windows on the order of decades, even centuries. Only in very few cases have predictions been attempted with quoted uncertainty windows of only a few years [3,4]. Seismologists are of course aware of these statistical limitations. This is why their majority believes that earthquakes are inherently unpredictable [5,6].In view of the enormously large amounts of mechanical energy released by major seismic events, however, it is inconceivable—from a physics perspective—that the Earth would not produce some identifiable non-seismic and non-mechanical signals prior to such large-scale catastrophic events. Whether or not, and to what extent, the precursory signals are reliable is another question.There have been countless accounts of precursory signals, too many to list here. They span a bewildering diversity of phenomena ranging from stories of unusual animal behavior on land, in the air and in the water, to the emission of electromagnetic radiation over many orders of frequency space, to distinct changes in the electron distribution at the lower edge of the ionosphere some 100–300 km above the surface of the Earth, and many others.The problem facing earthquake forecasting is not that there has been a lack of reported pre-earthquake (pre-EQ) phenomena. The real problem lies in the lack of understanding what the different types of reported pre-EQ phenomena mean and how they might be generated.There have also been countless attempts to interpret pre-EQ signals and to assign them to known physical processes that could occur in the Earth crust in response to the build-up of tectonic stresses. The problem is that the reported pre-EQ phenomena are so diverse and fall into the competency range of so many different scientific disciplines that it has not been possible, so far, to reach any consensus.If such a situation arises, namely that scientists from different disciplines cannot agree on a scientific explanation of a set of naturally occurring phenomena such as pre-EQ phenomena, chances are that the physical underpinning of the processes in the Earth crust during the build-up of tectonic stresses are not yet properly understood. This is particularly relevant to the contentious issue of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior reported in the scientific and non-scientific literature.1.1. Setting the StageEarthquakes are usually reported in terms of the location of their epicenter, their magnitude, and their depth. The hypocenter is defined as the point at depth, where the rupture starts. The epicenter is the point on the Earth surface straight above the hypocenter.Most major crustal earthquakes occur in the 7–35 km depth range. At this depth the isostatic overload is substantial, ranging from about 2,000 kg/cm2to 10,000 kg/cm2, 2–10 metric tons on every square centimeter. Under these conditions it is highly questionable whether two processes, which are widely quoted in the context of pre-EQ signals, can in fact take place: (i) microfracturing and (ii) the electrokinetic effect.Microfracturing had been introduced in the late 1960s as part of the “Dilatancy theory” [7,8], which started with the observation that, when rock cylinders are uniaxially stressed, they bulge out and that their total volume increases [9,10,11,12]. In unconstrained rock cylinders such volume increase is due to internal cracks opening as a result of the applied stress. However, deep in the Earth crust, under the isostatic load of tens of kilometers of rock, the opening of cracks or microfractures is unlikely because the attendant volume increase has to perform work against a very large overload.Rocks in the upper reaches of the Earth crust, from zero to about 5–7 km, have non-zero porosity. The pores are water-filled or brine-filled. They often communicate, allowing the fluids to flow along stress gradients. Such fluid flow leads to separation of charges because cations tend to be retained on the walls of pores and narrow channels, while anions are carried along with the flow. This is the electrokinetic effect. The resulting potential, the “streaming potential”, produces voltage signals, which have been invoked to explain geoelectric and electromagnetic signals recorded prior to major earthquakes [13,14,15,16]. However, streaming potentials can only be produced in the most shallow crust, where rocks are porous but where earthquakes do not typically occur.Nonetheless microfracturing and the electrokinetic effect have been invoked in the context of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior.A third process frequently quoted in the context of pre-EQ phenomena is emanation of radon gas from the ground. Radioactive222Rn, which has a half-life of 2.8 days and decays via emission of a 507 MeV alpha particle into polonium218Po, is a product of the uranium-radium decay chain. Changes in pre-EQ radon emanation have long been reported [17,18,19]. Each alpha particle emitted during radon decay creates about 105electron-ion pairs along its path, forming a narrow plasma channel, about 1 cm long in air. A small fraction of these electron-ion pairs escape recombination and, hence, lead to an increase in air conductivity. This air conductivity increase has been claimed to be responsible for a number of pre-EQ phenomena including animal behavior [20]. The idea is that, if changes in radon emanation are due to microfracturing, animals might possess unusual capabilities to detect the faint vibrations from microfracturing in the near-surface environment.Much of what has been said and written about pre-EQ phenomena can be traced back to the seismology and its reliance on mechanical concepts.Microfracturing, for instance, is based on the assumption that pre-EQ stresses can be transmitted laterally from the hypocenter over long distances defined as “earthquake preparation zone” where the radius r is given by the relation r = 100.43M, M the magnitude and r the distance in kilometers [21]. For a magnitude 7 earthquake r would be 1,000 km. Such large EQ preparation zones and the assumed lateral stress transfer are inconsistent with other reports that pre-EQ stress changes are seldom detected, even with most sensitive strain gauges [22,23,24,25,26].The electrokinetic effect is likewise based on mechanical concepts, namely that stress gradients provide the driving force for fluid flow through porous rocks, which in turn would generate electric signals. Fluctuations in the flow rate are then expected to lead to low frequency electromagnetic emissions [14].Many other attempts to find explanations for reported pre-EQ phenomena also rely on mechanical concepts inherited from seismology.1.2. Shifting ParadigmLargely unnoticed by the mainstream geoscience community, work over the past 3½ decades has led to crucial insight into non-seismic pre-EQ signals. The original goal of this work was to characterize inconspicuous defects in minerals: pairs of oxygen anions that have changed their valence from the common oxidation state 2- to the more oxidized state 1-. These so-called peroxy defects occur in the matrix of silicate minerals in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks—rocks that form the bulk of the Earth’s crust over the seismogenic depth range [27,28].Examples of peroxy defects are O3Si-OO-SiO3bonds replacing Si-O-Si bonds in mineral structures. The peroxy bonds are introduced through the dissolution of small amounts of “water” into minerals that crystallize from magma or recrystallize in deep high-temperature environments. The H2O molecules that enter into the solid state turn into “impurity” hydroxyls, O3Si-OH:O3Si-O-SiO3+ H2O ⬄ O3Si-OH HO-SiO3(1)Upon cooling, when diffusional processes freeze and thermodynamic equilibrium can no longer be maintained, the O3Si-OH pairs undergo a redox conversion:O3Si-OH HO-SiO3⬄ O3Si-OO-SiO3+ H2(2)This is a classical redox conversion, unusual only in the sense that the electron transfer involves hydroxyl oxygens donating an electron to their protons, reducing them to H. Two H combine to H2, while the oxygens, now oxidized to the valence state 1-, combine to form peroxy.The O−–O−bond in O3Si-OO-SiO3is very short, only 1.5 Å, about half the distance between normal neighboring O2−anions. The shortness makes the peroxy bonds susceptible to the perturbations such as the slightest sliding of mineral grains during the build-up of stress, causing O3Si-OO-SiO3bonds to break. The broken peroxy bonds split off electronic charge carriers, chemically O−in a matrix of O2−, physically defect electrons in the O2−sublattice, known as positive holes and symbolized by h•.The h•are highly mobile and have the capability to flow out of the stressed rock volume deep in the Earth crust, where a rock rupture may soon occur. The h•flow out into the surrounding rocks. They travel fast and far, tens of kilometers, possibly hundreds of kilometers prior to large earthquakes. They form electric currents in the Earth crust, sometimes hundreds of thousands of amperes strong [29]. When these currents fluctuate, they emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The ultralow frequency (ULF) components of these EM waves can be transmitted through tens of kilometers of rocks and detected at the Earth surface. Likewise the attenuation of ULF and ELF waves through ocean water is weak. Hence, the effects discussed here would also apply to cases where earthquakes occur offshore.When h•charge carriers arrive at the Earth surface or cross from the solid Earth into water, they cause a variety of reactions, physical and chemical. How these reactions express themselves in the surface environment is of interest in the context of animal response and the topic of this report."

Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus\nvia\na simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle\nvia\nan Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles\nvia\nlight–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for huge global disruption to health and economies.1–10As of 13 November 2020, more than 59.4 million people have suffered from COVID-19 disease and around 1.40 million have died worldwide1,2. It is now well documented that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are the important structural proteins for coronavirus particles.6–16Several reports indicate that spike protein plays the most important role for virus entry and disease pathogenesis.3–14Because at the time of writing there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, rapid diagnosis is the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.1–20Driven by the urgent need, we report the development of an anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle (GNP) for rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen (COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen) or the virus itselfvianaked eye colorimetric change and highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Recently, Venturaet al.reported highly sensitive COVID-19 detection by means of a colorimetric assay that employed GNPs to which three different (spike, envelope, and membrane) antibodies were attached.14In the current manuscript, we show that anti-spike antibody attached GNPs are capable of ultrasensitive identification as well as inhibition of virus particles.As we and others have reported before, owing to good biocompatibility, size dependent optical properties and ease of modification of the surface, gold nanoparticles can be used for the development of excellent biosensing platforms.17–33As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,†the color of our anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle is pink and it changed to a bluish tinge in the presence of the COVID-19 antigen or virus owing to aggregationviaantigen–antibody interaction. As a result, we observed a color change upon aggregation. Based on color observation with the naked eye, we can detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL and virus particles at a concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we have used a BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus (pseudo SARS-CoV-2) as a model system for our diagnosis and inhibition experiments.36,37Owing to its extremely high sensitivity, SERS can be used for detection of very low levels of viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and different biomolecules.17–27It is now well documented that Raman signals can be enhanced by several orders (107to 1010) of magnitude by using plasmonic nanoparticlesviathe electromagnetic mechanism (EM) and chemical mechanism (CM).17–27For rapid and highly sensitive identification, SERS has been employed using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) as reporter molecule, attached to gold nanoparticlesviaAu–S bonds. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, the aggregated nanoparticles form “hot spots”. As we and other groups have reported, that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS;17–27in the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles strong SERS signals from 4-aminothiophenol have been observed, which allow diagnosis of viral antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at 18 virus particles per mL concentration.It is now well documented that for SARS-CoV-2, the viral infection starts with the binding of viral particles to receptors on the host cells, mediated by the virus spike protein.8–17,34–41As different studies indicate that spike protein binds specifically to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,8–17scientists from several groups are developing inhibitors that have the capability to block the mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor.34–41Herein, using pseudo SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block viral entry into cells. Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL-1 baculovirus pseudotyped with spike (S) protein. Using HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by means of which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe\ncurrent global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million\ndeath till now.1−4It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike\nprotein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates\nthe virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which\nis the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.5−9Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19\nvaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing\nantibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.9−14The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which\ncontain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the\nbinding affinity with ACE2.1−6Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to\na prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta\nvariant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.7−12Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike\nprotein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate\nvariant infection.Although the mortality rate is very high\nfor COVID-19, reported\ndata also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic\ncarriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled\nby the human’s innate immune system.1−9α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and\nHNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as\nLL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members\nof the innate immune system.11,15−17Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human\nbody for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.11,15−17Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection,\nherein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene\nquantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as\nshown inFigure1.Figure 1.Open in a new tab(A) Scheme\nshowing the design of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-conjugated GQDs and binding of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to severe social and economic consequences spanning the entire world (1,2). Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging (3). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus (4) transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets (5) and sometimes fecal-oral routes (6), potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues (7). Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal.SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces (8–11). Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors (12), for example, parainfluenza (13), adenovirus (14–16), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (17,18), cytomegalovirus (16,19), and herpes simplex virus (20). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (21–26). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs (9,10,27). These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (10) and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity (28).Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration (9,11). Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series ofin vivopharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity.Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans. Results indicate efficient delivery, extended retention of heparin in the nasal passages, and clearance of intranasally administered UFH with no major adverse effects."

        "Title": "Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains by marine sulfated glycans.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.\nKeywords:\nfucosylated chondroitin sulfate, nuclear magnetic resonance, SARS-CoV-2, sulfated fucan, viral inhibition",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 6.3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years (World Health Organization [WHO] Covid Dashboard). The causal pathogen of this pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped betacoronavirus (Hu et al. 2020). This virus expresses a heavily glycosylated spike protein (S-protein) on its envelope (Belouzard et al. 2012). The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of COVID-19; however, the chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence of variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission rates and the likelihood of evading host immune responses.The S-protein expressed on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary mode of contact with the host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thus determining viral tropism, entry, and pathogenesis (Belouzard et al. 2012). The S-protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which possesses 2 subunits. The S1 subunit, which is capable of interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and the S2 subunit, which helps in membrane fusion, an event necessary for the internalization of the virus particle in the host cell (Belouzard et al. 2012;Tian et al. 2021).Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing the important protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease (Callaway 2020). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs (Tian et al. 2021). Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant (Saito et al. 2021). The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acid mutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N (Tian et al. 2021). The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility (Planas et al. 2021;Tian et al. 2021). The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing the molecular binding affinity and viral infectivity (Tian et al. 2021). Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD, strengthening the ACE2 binding (Goher et al. 2021). The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Tian et al. 2021), thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection (Saito et al. 2021). The L452R mutation has been shown to significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma (Tian et al. 2021).Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a reasonably consistent manner is critical. As S-protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (Clausen et al. 2020). The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain)(Jin et al. 2020;Kim et al. 2020;Mycroft-West et al. 2020;Dwivedi et al. 2021;Song et al. 2021;Tandon et al. 2021;Guimond et al. 2022;Kim et al. 2022). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs (Dwivedi et al. 2021). Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs."

        "Title": "Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMany viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber\nPentacta pygmaea\n(PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.\nKeywords:\nherpesviruses, marine sulfated glycans, virus entry",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBetaherpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are common human pathogens, yet only a small percentage of infected people experience acute illness [1]. In people with impaired immune systems, HCMV-mediated infections can be life-threatening. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease, HCMV poses a serious threat in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as well as in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients [2]. In addition, HCMV infection in utero is the leading cause of congenital infection that can result in developmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delays, and even fetal death [3,4,5].There are currently no commercially available vaccines to prevent HCMV infection [6] and only a small number of drugs, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, maribavir, and letermovir, have been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment/prophylaxis of HCMV infection and disease [7,8]. Moreover, drug resistance is increasingly common with circulating strains acquiring UL54 (polymerase) and/or UL97 (kinase) mutations that confer resistance to commonly available drugs [9,10,11]. Therefore, the identification of newer anti-HCMV drugs with improved efficacy and novel modes of action are essentially needed.Heparan sulfate (HS) is present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix of most mammalian tissues [12,13]. Numerous viruses including HCMV attach to host cells by first engaging with cell surface HS glycosaminoglycan chains, followed by interaction with the specific protein receptors, which results in virus entry [14,15]. HCMV can infect different types of cells and tissues indicating that it can engage with a wide variety of host cell receptors to enter the cell and establish an infection [16,17,18,19]. Specific viral glycoproteins engage these structurally and functionally distinct receptors that include the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, cellular integrins, neuropilin-2, and epidermal growth factor receptor [20,21,22,23,24,25,26].Earlier, our group showed that HCMV preferentially binds to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS using its surface glycoprotein B (gB) [15]. HS mimetics, including heparin, bind to gB and inhibit HCMV infection by competitively inhibiting virus attachment to the cell surface [15,27]. Heparin is composed of disaccharide-repeating units (Figure 1A) and is an efficient anticoagulant; it can cause excessive bleeding and thrombocytopenia that necessitate close patient observation and, if necessary, the administration of an antidote (protamine) [28,29]. Two potential solutions to these anticoagulant side effects are using either the naturally potent anti-viral sulfated glycans with lower anticoagulant properties or the dissociation of the anticoagulant and anti-viral properties of the existing heparin. We were able to provide instances of both in our earlier work [28,30,31]. In contrast to heparin, a newly discovered fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the body wall of the sea cucumberPentacta pygmaea(PpFucCS) was found to have significantly lower anticoagulant activity but significant antiviral efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [28]. The PpFucCS anticoagulant activity can be further reduced by hydrolysis into oligosaccharide fractions [30].Figure 1.Open in a new tabStructural representation of sulfated glycans assayed for anti-HCMV activity. (A) Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is mostly composed of repeating disaccharide units of [→4)-α-GlcN-(1→4)-α-IdoA-(1→] where GlcN is glucosamine and IdoA is iduronic acid. Sulfation occurs frequently at the N- and C6-positions of GlcN and C2 position of IdoA. (B) PpFucCS is constituted of a chondroitin sulfate backbone that alternates N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) in repeating disaccharide units of [→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcA-(1→], where the GalNAc units are primarily 4-sulfated (80%) and, to a very less degree, 4,6-disulfated (10%) or nonsulfated (10%). The GlcA units are replaced at the C3 position by three different forms of α-fucose (Fuc) branches: Fuc2,4S-(1→(40%), Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-Fuc-(1→(30%), and Fuc4S-(1→(30%); where S = SO3−.In the current investigation, PpFucCS (Figure 1B) was used to target HS–virus interaction and prevent HCMV entry into cells. We show that PpFucCS has significant antiviral activity against HCMV and that, when hydrolyzed into fractions, the oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHuman exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with\n137\nCs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.\nKeywords:\ncytomegalovirus, radiation, galactic cosmic radiation, spaceflight, herpes viral reactivation",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionInfection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities.Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p< 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49."

        "Title": "A Tissue Retrieval and Postharvest Processing Regimen for Rodent Reproductive Tissues Compatible with Long-Term Storage on the International Space Station and Postflight Biospecimen Sharing Program",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nCollection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80°C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNA\nlater\nup to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWith the current paucity of opportunities for studying whole animal mammalian physiology in space flight, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) for postflight tissue collection offers the opportunity to broaden access to biological samples shortly after return and maximize the data generated from flight animal payloads. The logistics of space flight experiments involving live animals often requires harvesting tissues at a remote site, followed by shipping the specimens to the Principle Investigators' laboratories for detailed analysis. Furthermore, as the capabilities to house rodent and other animals on the International Space station (ISS), and to conduct long-term space flight experiments using animals are enabled, the need to harvest and fix tissues for long-term storage on ISS that will retain high quality RNA and protein for subsequent analysis in laboratories on Earth is also required. These approaches to live animal experimentation in space flight that include tissue harvest for multiple investigators require determination of (1) tissue-specific windows of time between euthanasia and tissue fixation that retain quality of histology and (2) tissue-specific windows of time for tissue fixation that retain high quality protein and RNA for subsequent analysis. Determination of these windows provides a quantitative, logical approach to generate appropriately prioritized and optimized tissue harvest and fixation logistics in a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program scenario, be it on Earth or during tissue harvest on the ISS. In addition, tissue storage methods should retain high sample quality under long-term storage, as samples may be harvested and stored on the ISS but may not be returned to Earth for many months, depending on ISS to Earth flight frequency and payload capacities. This issue has been addressed for preserving plant material for gene expression analysis [1], but there is no data available for animal tissues. Our participation in the BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA (KSC) for animals flown for 12–15 days in orbit on three space shuttle flights: STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135. In addition, we harvested tissues from male mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 days in orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BION series of flight experiments involved age- and time-matched ground control groups of animals. During the early flight planning phase of BION, there were possibilities that male or female mice would be flown and that male gerbil tissues may also be provided to the BSP. Thus, to be prepared for any of these possibilities, we undertook to determine the optimal tissue harvest windows for all of the species and reproductive tissues that we might be able to obtain. Our participation in these multi-investigator specimen sharing efforts covering four different primary flight PI experimental designs and harvest logistics necessitated a determination of the window of time between euthanasia and harvest and preservation of our tissues of interest that would allow us sufficient flexibility to obtain the highest possible quality of tissue for histopathology, RNA for gene-transcription analysis, and protein for expression and posttranslational modification analysis. A determination of these time windows is essential, since the tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators are provided after the primary flight PI's have obtained their tissues. Knowledge of the optimal windows for all of the tissues of interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvest flow logistics that can provide each of the BSP team members the highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, as we report here, we developed a strategy to determine the window of time between euthanasia and fixation for retention of high quality histology for male and female reproductive organs. We also determined methods for long-term tissue storage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both high quality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable and can be applied to harvest and storage of other time-sensitive labile tissues from animals and plants. Furthermore, these methods can be used to optimize logistics and data collection under multi-investigator tissue harvest and sharing programs operated by any space agency, commercial entity, or flight platform."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOrganismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including\nDrosophila\nand\nC. elegans\n. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.\nSubject terms:\nSystems biology, Computational biology and bioinformatics",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionWe have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts6,7. Sex differences play a role in diseases and metabolism both on Earth and in space8. Some of these differences may be attributed to sex hormones. Estrogens play a variety of roles and serve many functions in women’s lives. Besides being a reproductive hormone, estrogen is involved in metabolism as well as in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems9. Estrogen signaling activates membrane and nuclear receptors in both canonical and non-canonical ways to modulate metabolism, and promote growth, proliferation, and differentiation of diverse cell types10,11. Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR212but whose ligands are unknown. ESRRA also has DNA sequence homology to the estrogen receptor and can be activated by phytoestrogens (i.e. genistein)13. These receptors play pivotal roles in metabolism, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and mitochondrial function12. Besides that, an unbalanced ratio of these receptors may have an impact on metabolism14. Additionally, estrogen and insulin combine in controlling metabolic pathways. In animal models, knockout of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (ESR1) in both male and female mice results in insulin resistance and dysglycemia15–17. Estrogen receptors promote pancreatic cell survival, enhance insulin production, and improve insulin sensitivity18,19. Female and maleESR1−/− mice both display reduced GLUT4 expression, further emphasizing the role of estrogen in glycemic control14. Clinically, compared to premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have an increased risk of adverse metabolic profiles such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid profiles, increased android fat deposition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis20. Estrogens also positively correlate with bone and muscle mass and are protective against disuse atrophy21. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that insulin and estrogen signaling are key pathways regulating health in space.The amount of knowledge in the literature about how insulin and estrogen signaling and related pathways change during spaceflight is currently sparse. Our preliminary findings reported possible insulin and estrogen signaling alteration during spaceflight22,23. A few published studies show insulin resistance parameters may change during spaceflight but data are conflicting, suggesting either decreased insulin or no change24,25. Similarly, data on estrogen signaling are conflicting with one study revealing downregulation ofESR1andESR2in the uterus26whereas a recent study found no alterations in estrogen receptor expression in rodent ovaries27. To address these gaps in our knowledge of insulin and estrogen signaling in response to spaceflight we examined these signaling pathways across multiple tissues in rodents from the same mission as well as in a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants/astronauts. Our results indicate significant changes in these pathways in response to spaceflight in both mice and people. These observations lay the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight as well as highlighting insulin and estrogen signaling as potential targets for countermeasures in future spaceflight missions."

        "Title": "Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.\nKeywords:\nEnthesis, Biomechanics, Paralysis, Unloading, Structure, Shoulder, Rotator Cuff",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment. Mechanical forces are necessary to maintain tissue structure and composition capable of bearing loads. Loss of these forces due to disuse, paralysis, or microgravity leads to significant functional deficit in these tissues. For example, bone unloading results in rapid resorption and loss of mass, leading to decreased mechanical properties [1–10]. Likewise, unloading of tendon results in decreased collagen production, stiffness, and strength [11–14]. Tendon near myotendinous junction is affected in response to muscle unloading [15]. However, little is known about how protracted unloading affects the site of load transfer between bone and tendon and the most common site of rotator cuff tears, the enthesis. Previous work has demonstrated that muscle loading is necessary for the fetal and postnatal development of the enthesis [16–18] and can affect the healing of injuries to the enthesis [19–21]. However, the effects of unloading on the homeostasis of the mature enthesis is not understood.The healthy enthesis is a hierarchical composite structure optimized to efficiently transfer loads from tendon to bone to produce joint motion. At the millimeter length scale, tendon attaches to bone with a splayed morphology over a large surface area to minimize stresses [22–24]. At the micrometer length scale, mineralized and unmineralized fibrocartilage interdigitate, providing a mechanism to increase the toughness of the attachment [25]. In addition to interdigitations, gradients in mineral content, collagen orientation, and extracellular matrix composition exist across the interface to minimize stress singularities [26–28]. The width of the mineral gradient, however, does not vary with muscle force, as local stresses are invariant between species and during growth [18,22,24,26]. At the nanometer length scale, prior studies of the mineral gradient suggest that crystal organization and its location relative to the collagen fibrils are different in regions of high mineralization compared to regions of low mineralization [18,29]. Protracted unloading has been shown to change the composition and crystallinity of the mineral crystals within the gradient of developing entheses [18]. These changes in the structure and organization of bioapatite crystals at the enthesis in healthy and unloaded tissues can have significant effects on the tendon-to-bone attachment mechanics [28,30]. However, it is not known how mineral crystal composition and organization change as a function of loading. As hierarchical structures across multiple length scales participate in load transfer at the enthesis, it is important to establish which of these are compromised as a result of unloading. This understanding will allow for the development of focused and relevant therapeutic approaches.In this study, we investigated the effects of unloading on adult shoulders at multiple hierarchical scales. We hypothesized that unloading would result in compromised mechanics and structural modifications at the nano-, micro- and macro-scales. To test this, the shoulders of adult mice were locally paralyzed via botulinum toxin A (botox) injections. Mechanical testing, spectroscopic, and imaging techniques were employed to examine the effects of extended unloading on the enthesis across a wide range of spatial scales. Our results provide the first multiscale description of how unloading affects the adult shoulder."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDespite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis (\nCatK\n,\nTnfsf11)\nand mature osteoblasts (\nCol1\n,\nOsc)\n. Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation (\nMmp3, Mmp13)\n. These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.\nKeywords:\nenthesis, spaceflight, composition, structure, mechanics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWith increased interest in long-term space exploration, such as the proposed mission to Mars, it has become increasingly important to explore the effects of the space environment on the musculoskeletal system. In particular, decreased loading due to microgravity can cause significant loss of bone and muscle mass and predispose those tissues to injury (1,2). The effects of disuse on the musculoskeletal system have been examined via a number of earthbound analogues. These model systems have shown that disuse leads to decreased muscle mass, decreased tendon thickness, bone loss, and compromised strength and stiffness of both tendon and bone (3,4). However, these earthbound analogues are not able to fully capture the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system (5). Thus, it remains necessary to directly examine how the musculoskeletal system responds to the space environment.In the last several decades, space-based studies have brought us a wealth of information about how the musculoskeletal system reacts to spaceflight conditions. Much like with the earthbound analogues, decreases in bone and tendon mass as well as compromised mechanics have been reported (3,6). However, although structural and mechanical changes of individual tissues have been well examined, there is little information about what happens at the interfaces between these tissues. The tendon-to-bone attachment (the “enthesis”) enables the transfer of load from muscles to the skeleton, allowing for joint motion. However, due to the presence of stress concentrators that arise at interfaces between dissimilar materials such as tendon and bone (7–9), the enthesis is at high risk for rupture (10). Furthermore, this interface is particularly sensitive to changes in its loading environment; earthbound studies have shown that 3 weeks of muscle paralysis leads to defects in murine enthesis structure and mechanics at multiple length scales (11). At the millimeter scale, there was a significant loss of trabecular bone. At the micrometer scale, changes in mineral size and orientation led to defects in energy absorption. At the nanoscale, loss of carbonate in the mineral lattice led to stiffening of the mineral. Together, these structural and compositional changes led to an increased risk and extent of failure at the tendon attachment. In the current study, mice from NASA missions STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 were examined after multiple weeks of spaceflight. Changes to the structural, compositional, and mechanical properties of tendon entheses were examined."

While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive.\nMethods\nWe profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis.\nResults\nWe report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (\nkit\nW/W-v\n) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient\nkit\nW/W-v\nmice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in\nkit\nW/W-v\nmice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx.

        "Title": "Acute exposure to high dose gamma-radiation results in transient activation of bone lining cells",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.\nKeywords:\nmurine, bone histomorphometry, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteoporosis, bone marrow",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHuman exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation can occur as a result of treatment modalities or accident. Also, high dose whole body radiation is a common strategy in biomedical research to ablate bone marrow cells as a prelude to stem cell transplantation. As a side effect, radiation therapy to treat cancer in humans or in biomedical research results in collateral damage to other tissues, including the skeleton [1]. The spectrum of skeletal abnormalities associated with radiation therapy in humans ranges from growth suppression in children to osteopenia, sclerosis, necrosis and sarcomatous transformation at all ages [2,3]. High dose ionizing radiation is also a risk factor for the development of fractures that typically have prolonged healing times and a high nonunion rate [4]. In spite of compelling human evidence for impaired skeletal function following high-dose ionizing radiation, this complication is rarely considered in bone marrow transplantation studies performed in animal models.Whole body exposure to high dose ionizing radiation, although uncommon in humans, can occur as a result of nuclear accident [5]. Future manned space travel beyond the earth’s protective magnetic field will undoubtedly also increase the potential for exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation, which include particles (electrons, neutrons, protons and atomic nuclei) as well as photons (x-rays and γ-rays) [6]. Importantly, the precise biological effects of ionizing radiation depend upon numerous factors, including species, age, type of radiation, dose and dose rate [5,7].Short-duration exposure to more than 1 gray (Gy) of radiation can lead to acute radiation syndrome and in humans > 6 Gy is often lethal. Acute radiation syndrome consists of hematopoietic, gastrointestinal and neurovascular manifestations, the timing and magnitude of which are dose-dependent [8]. The long-term skeletal consequences of surviving acute radiation syndrome in humans have received little attention. However, modeling acute radiation syndrome in animals has demonstrated detrimental effects on bone mass and architecture [9-11].There has been significant interest in mitigating the detrimental effects of radiation to reduce morbidity and mortality following exposure. Exposure to small (priming) doses of ionizing radiation has been shown to induce cellular radioprotective mechanisms following γ-irradiation [12]. Induction of radioadaptation by this method reduces mortality following subsequent exposure to much higher (challenging) doses of radiation. The state of acquired radioresistance is associated with reduced radiosensitivity and hypercompensation by hematopoietic cells to radiation-induced damage [13]. Although effective in reducing mortality, which may be of particular value for marrow transplantation studies in immune compromised radiosensitive mice, it is uncertain whether low dose radiation-induced radioresistance will impact bone marrow ablation or protect the skeleton from the detrimental effects of high dose irradiation.Medical intervention in humans, including administration of growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to improve immune function, can reduce mortality in individuals accidently exposed to whole body ionizing radiation [14]. Mitigation of lethal intestinal injury, following high local doses of irradiation in mice, has been achieved by intravenous transplantation of bone marrow-derived stromal and hematopoietic stem cells [15-17]. However, it is not clear whether interventions involving growth factor administration or bone marrow transplantation impact the long-duration adverse skeletal effects of irradiation. It is, therefore, unclear how countermeasures to accidental exposure to high dose whole body irradiation in humans or bone marrow transplantation following radiation-induced bone marrow ablation in animals influence bone metabolism.The goals of the present studies were to evaluate the early effects of acute whole body γ-irradiation on bone metabolism in a mouse model and determine whether the anticipated detrimental effects of a challenging high-dose irradiation are attenuated by prior exposure to a relatively low dose of priming radiation. In addition, we investigated the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation in reversing the long-duration skeletal effects of high-dose whole body γ-irradiation."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionLeptin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, is best known for its role in the regulation of appetite and energy metabolism (Mistry, et al. 1997;Myers 2004). Rodents deficient in leptin signaling, due to either an inability to generate leptin (ob/obmice) or the signaling form of the leptin receptor (db/dbmice andfa/farats), become morbidly obese (Clement 2000). Their excess weight is the result of a combination of hyperphagia and reduced thermogenesis (Hwa, et al. 1996). In addition to morbid obesity, leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadism (Barkan, et al. 2005), elevated corticosteroid levels (Saito and Bray 1983), and impaired thermoregulation (Trayhurn and James 1978).Leptin-deficient mice and leptin receptor-deficient mice and rats have reduced overall bone mass, reduced longitudinal bone growth (Kishida, et al. 2005;Steppan, et al. 2000), and decreased bone formation (Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008). In addition, impaired bone resorption inob/obanddb/dbmice results in mild osteopetrosis (Turner, et al. 2013), a condition which may contribute to the reported reductions in bone quality observed in these animals (Ealey, et al. 2006;Kimura, et al. 2012). Impaired bone resorption may also account for the age- and bone-dependent variation in cancellous bone volume observed in leptin signaling-deficient mice; the mutant mice are reported to have normal to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra and decreased to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in long bones (Hamrick, et al. 2004;Iwaniec, et al. 2007;Williams, et al. 2011). The skeletal abnormalities observed in mice and rats with defective leptin signaling suggest that leptin plays a role in normal skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover (Bartell, et al. 2011;Iwaniec et al. 2007;Kishida et al. 2005;Steppan et al. 2000;Turner et al. 2013). However, it is not clear to what extent the skeletal phenotype ofob/obmice is impacted by additional factors associated with morbid obesity.Although rare in humans, leptin signaling deficiency occurs as a result of loss of function mutations in the genes for leptin and the leptin receptor (Friedman and Halaas 1998). More common causes for low leptin signaling in humans include anorexia and starvation (Dardeno, et al. 2010;Muller, et al. 2009). At the other end of the spectrum, diet-induced leptin resistance, associated with chronically elevated leptin levels, mimics many of the metabolic consequences of leptin deficiency on energy metabolism and is thought to contribute to development of morbid obesity (Jung and Kim 2013). Thus, changes in leptin levels and/or leptin sensitivity could have physiological effects on bone metabolism.In order to better understand the specific actions of leptin in regulating bone mass, density and architecture, we performed a study in which differences in body weight gain between rapidly growing wild type (WT) andob/obmice were prevented by housing all mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure (Trayhurn 1979) and pair-feeding the mutant mice to WT mice to equalize food intake."

        "Title": "Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body weight without accelerating age-related bone loss",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExcessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (−4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (−80%), serum leptin (−77%), and serum IGF1 (−34%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.\nKeywords:\nrAAV-Leptin, microcomputed tomography, dual energy absorptiometry, white adipose tissue",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionInsidious excessive weight gain is common in adults and is associated with increased risk for various chronic diseases, including heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers (Franssen, et al. 2008;Low, et al. 2009;Magliano 2008). Weight loss, whether induced by caloric restriction alone or in combination with exercise and/or pharmaceutical intervention, may attenuate or reverse the health risks associated with excessive weight gain. Unfortunately, the long-term efficacy of conventional weight loss interventions is generally poor and many individuals weight-cycle through repetitive bouts of weight loss followed by rapid weight regain (Elfhag and Rossner 2005;Wu, et al. 2009;Yaskin, et al. 2009).The adipokine leptin plays an essential role in energy homeostasis (Rosenbaum and Leibel 2014) and adult-onset weight gain is closely associated with an increase in circulating leptin and development of leptin resistance (Carter, et al. 2013;Knobelspies, et al. 2010;Morris and Rui 2009;Scarpace and Tumer 2001). As a consequence, avoiding leptin resistance may be essential to achieving life-long weight control. However, the mechanisms mediating leptin resistance are incompletely understood. To date, studies suggest that high blood leptin concentrations result in saturation of leptin transport across the blood brain barrier (blood brain barrier resistance) (Banks and Lebel 2002) and/or down regulation of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus due to constitutive expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (hypothalamic resistance) (Bjorbaek, et al. 1998).Delivery of leptin directly into the hypothalamus by gene therapy normalizes body weight and extends lifespan in morbidly obese leptin-deficientob/obmice in the absence of detectable circulating leptin (Boghossian, et al. 2007;Dhillon, et al. 2000). Additionally, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy slows weight gain in rodents capable of producing leptin (Boghossian, et al. 2005). These findings suggest that increasing leptin levels directly in the hypothalamus, in addition to bypassing blood brain barrier-mediated leptin resistance, overcomes hypothalamic leptin resistance. However, it is less clear whether this approach can induce weight loss and/or maintain lower body weight in aging rodents with normal circulating levels of the hormone (Shapiro, et al. 2008).In humans, calorie restriction-induced weight loss is often associated with bone loss, leading to increased risk for osteoporosis (Lee, et al. 2010b;Shapses and Riedt 2006). Importantly, weight regain does not restore bone and, as a consequence, weight cycling is especially deleterious to the skeletal system (Lee et al. 2010b;Villalon, et al. 2011). Because osteoporotic fractures are associated with decreased quality of life and increased mortality (Cauley 2013), there is strong incentive to develop weight loss strategies that preserve bone mass.Leptin is a candidate factor for coupling bone metabolism to energy availability. Leptin is required for normal skeletal growth, maturation and turnover (Arounleut, et al. 2013;Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008;Turner, et al. 2013b;Turner, et al. 2014). Weight loss results in decreased leptin levels (Hamann and Matthaei 1996), reduced bone accrual during growth (Devlin, et al. 2010), and accelerated age-related bone loss (Talbott, et al. 2001;Turner and Iwaniec 2011). Importantly, leptin treatment attenuates the inhibitory effects of caloric restriction on bone growth (Gat-Yablonski, et al. 2004;Goldstone, et al. 2002). Furthermore, leptin administered at supraphysiological levels has been reported to maintain bone mineral density despite inducing weight loss (Stunes, et al. 2012).Taken together, the above findings suggest the respective skeletal changes accompanying caloric restriction-induced weight loss and leptin-induced weight loss differ. Specifically, low hypothalamic leptin levels induced by caloric restriction lead to an adaptive response similar to starvation and result in rapid bone loss. In contrast, elevating hypothalamic leptin levels decreases appetite and increases energy expenditure (Friedman 2010) leading to weight loss with minimal impact on the skeleton. Although suggestive, the aforementioned conclusions are based on short-term studies where leptin was administered subcutaneously to growing rats with relatively low levels of circulating leptin. It is less clear whether similar benefits can be achieved in skeletally mature animals exhibiting weight gain as well as age-related bone loss. As such, the present study was designed to determine the long-term efficacy of increased hypothalamic leptin in reducing adult onset-associated weight gain and the impact this intervention has on bone mass, density and architecture."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLow bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient\nob/ob\nmice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in\nob/ob\nmice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male\nob/ob\nmice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10\n7\nparticles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets;\nob/ob\nmice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in\nob/ob\nmice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.\nKeywords:\nadipocyte, osteoblast, osteoclast, stem cell, osteoporosis, histomorphometry, rAAV",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAdipose tissue in bone marrow may contribute to metabolic health through its effects on local energy balance and/or its actions as an endocrine organ (1). Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity (2,3). Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of differentiating into cells of the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages (4). A reciprocal relationship between the number of mature osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes may occur as a consequence of differentiation of MSCs toward one lineage at the expense of the other lineage (5,6). Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor that plays a key role in regulation of adipogenesis and lipid uptake, has been implicated as a factor controlling MSC differentiation. Inhibition of PPARγ increases osteoblast differentiation while decreasing adipocyte differentiation. Osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ inhibits bone mass gain in male mice and increases ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in female mice (5). Furthermore, cultured adipocytes release factors capable of inducing osteoblast linage cells to differentiate into an adipocyte-like phenotype (7). Thus, excessive marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has the potential to directly and/or indirectly reduce bone mass by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. As such, an increase in MAT may contribute to osteoporosis in conditions, such as menopause, skeletal disuse, alcohol abuse, and eating disorders (3,8,9).Interestingly, anorexia and obesity both result in increased MAT (10,11). Anorexia is commonly associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. By contrast, being overweight is generally associated with increased BMD and reduced fracture risk. However, recent studies suggest that morbid obesity has negative effects on bone quality (12,13). Thus, it is possible that the increase in MAT plays a role in the detrimental skeletal changes associated with both extremes in body weight.Leptin, an adipokine produced in proportion to fat mass, plays a critical role in central nervous system-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis (14). Additionally, leptin plays an important positive role in skeletal growth and maturation (15,16). Indeed, leptin signaling deficiency results in abnormal growth plate development (17) and mild osteopetrosis (18).Leptin suppresses PPARγ expression and increases lipolysis in adipose tissue in rodents (19). In parallel, leptin increases longitudinal bone growth, osteoblastogenesis and bone formation (15,16). Thus, the low leptin levels resulting from insufficient adipose tissue observed in anorexia may contribute to increased MAT and decreased bone formation. In contrast to anorexia, obesity typically results in increased leptin levels which, in turn, should suppress MAT. Many authors have concluded that leptin resistance plays an important role in hyperphagia and weight gain associated with obesity (20). Thus, leptin resistance may counteract the expected response to elevated leptin levels and thereby contribute to an increase in MAT during obesity. However, some new studies question whether resistance to endogenous leptin contributes to development of diet-induced obesity in mice (21,22). If leptin resistance is a major contributor to the etiology of obesity, it may be overcome in normal rodents, at least in part, by increasing hypothalamic leptin levels. Whatever its precise role in diet-induced obesity, it is clear that leptin resistance resulting from loss of function of the leptin receptor (db/dbmice), in addition to inducing morbid obesity, results in profound negative effects on the skeleton. Furthermore, some of these negative skeletal effects (e.g., reduced bone formation) are recapitulated, without impacting energy metabolism, following adoptive transfer of bone marrow fromdb/dbmice into wild-type (WT) mice (16).Leptin-deficientob/oband leptin receptor-deficientdb/dbmice exhibit excessive MAT in long bones (16). Short-term delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus was shown to reduce peripheral fat depots as well as MAT (23,24). However, the long-term effects of increased leptin levels on MAT have not been well characterized. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy has been shown to result in life-long reductions in body weight inob/obmice (25). The goal of the present study was to determine the long-duration effects of increased hypothalamic leptin, using recombinant adeno-associated virus leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep), on bone marrow adiposity in morbidly obeseob/obmice. Given that the energy density of a diet impacts weight gain and MAT levels (26), the effects of a regular and high energy density (high fat) diet were also evaluated."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose\nFemale mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18–23°C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture.\nMethods\nGrowing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at either 22 °C or 32°C for up to 18 weeks.\nResults\nC57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32°C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The impact of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone was not limited to C57BL/6J mice as C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. The beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased\nUcp1\ngene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and locally decreased bone resorption.\nConclusions\nHousing female mice at 22°C resulted in premature cancellous bone loss.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionMice, because of their small size, short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation are a mainstay for cutting edge research in fundamental skeletal biology. In addition, mice are frequently utilized as preclinical models for metabolic bone disease associated with aging, including senile, disuse, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. Although the skeletons of mice and humans share many common characteristics, there are also notable species differences in bone physiology that may impact the usefulness of the mouse as a preclinical model for metabolic bone disease [1].Humans and mice both exhibit age-related bone loss. However, the timing and pattern of bone loss in mice differs markedly from humans [2,3]. In contrast to humans, cancellous bone loss in mice begins even as their bones continue to elongate and cortical bone mass continues to be accrued [4,5]. This is especially true for female C57BL/6J (B6) mice, a strain commonly used in bone research. By the time these mice reach skeletal maturity, generally defined by cessation in bone elongation (4–6 months of age), they have lost the majority of their cancellous bone in proximal tibia and distal femur, key clinically relevant sites. As a consequence, remarkably little cancellous bone remains in skeletally mature mice to model the impact of age or specific factors, such as ovarian hormone deficiency or skeletal disuse, known to contribute to the etiology of osteoporosis.Utilization of young mice as a strategy to circumvent premature bone loss is contraindicated by an extensive body of evidence indicating that the growing skeleton is an inappropriate model for the adult human skeleton [1,6–11]. In adult humans, basic multicellular unit (BMU)-based bone remodeling helps maintain bone quality by repairing microdamage and by adjusting bone microarchitecture to meet mechanical needs [8]. Also, cancellous bone loss in ageing humans occurs largely as a consequence of a negative remodeling balance [6,8]. In contrast, in the growing skeleton, cancellous bone architecture is in a state of flux. Specifically, bone is added to the cancellous compartment by endochondral ossification and removed by destructive modeling. Additionally, modeling drifts alter trabecular thickness and reorient trabeculae in response to prevailing mechanical loads [9–11]. Thus, bone balance during growth is impacted by cellular mechanisms that are either strictly limited or, in the case of endochondral ossification, completely absent in adults.The cause of the premature cancellous bone loss in mice is unknown, but housing conditions, including ambient temperature, may play a role. A review of results from experiments conducted in our laboratory showed unusually high cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis of B6 mice housed at 32°C [12]. An association between environmental temperature and limb length has been noted in mammals in the wild and laboratory studies have shown that temperature modulates growth plate cartilage synthesis [13]. These findings strongly allude to exposure to a cold environment as having a negative effect on bone acquisition and retention. However, studies to date have emphasized temperature extremes and have provided limited insight into the underlying mechanisms. Also, prior studies have not focused on the impact of housing temperature on bone architecture or on the effects of environmental temperature on age-related bone loss. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation was to assess whether mitigating cold adaptation by thermoneutral housing influences bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture in female mice."

        "Title": "Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThere is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (\nn\n=11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe adult skeleton undergoes continuous bone remodeling, a sequential process that involves bone resorption followed by bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD), a commonly used index of bone mass in adults, is maintained over time when bone formation is efficiently coupled to the prevailing rate of bone resorption. Bone loss occurs when there is an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption where resorption predominates. Bone loss is a common occurrence among astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. The reduction of BMD is generally associated with an increase in biochemical markers of bone resorption with no change in biochemical markers in bone formation.1–3These findings suggest that spaceflight results in a defect in the coupling of bone formation to bone resorption.4The precise mechanism for this is unknown.Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has generated considerable recent interest as a putative negative regulator of bone formation.5Fat accumulates in bone marrow during prolonged bed rest,6a ground-based human model for spaceflight. Although fat accumulation in bone marrow has not been verified in astronauts, an increase in MAT has been observed in rodents following spaceflight.7,8Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stromal cells. Based primarily on cell culture studies, some investigators have concluded that increased adipocyte differentiation inevitably occurs at the expense of osteoblast differentiation.9–11If correct, then the increase in bone marrow adiposity during spaceflight may reflect a shift in the differentiation program of stromal cells from osteoblasts to adipocytes. This may prevent normal coupling of bone formation to the prevailing level of bone resorption and thus have a causative role in the negative bone remodeling balance. The anticipated consequence of this mechanism is reduced generation of osteoblasts.There is an alternative, non-mutually exclusive mechanism by which increased MAT can negatively influence bone metabolism. More than 50 adipocyte-derived adipokines, growth factors, and proinflammatory cytokines have been identified, including interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). IL-1β inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption,12and mRNA levels for IL-1β were shown to be increased in tibia in rats flown aboard STS-62 (ref.13). Thus, factors produced in bone marrow during spaceflight could reduce bone formation by (1) slowing the rate of osteoblast appearance onto bone surfaces, (2) increasing the rate of osteoblast disappearance from bone surfaces, or (3) inhibiting osteoblast activity.One or both mechanisms could perpetuate a cycle where increasing MAT would lead to progressive bone loss during prolonged spaceflight. The present study, using archived vertebrae from rats flown on STS-62, utilized a novel approach to challenge these mechanisms by evaluating the association between bone resorption, MAT accumulation, and osteoblast kinetics in sexually mature ovariectomized (OVX) rats subjected to a 14-day spaceflight."

        "Title": "Role of oestrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (\np\n< 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (\np\n< 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.\nKeywords:\nestrogen receptor, leptin, skeletal longitudinal growth, growth plate, endochondral bone formation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionLeptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and cancellous bones (1). The mammalian second growth spurt period occurs at puberty. One of the characterizations for the growth spurt is rapid skeletal longitudinal growth. Results in a clinical investigation, in order to clarify the relationship between anthropometric data and concentrations of serum leptin in the catch-up growth procedure, showed that increasing leptin concentrations might trigger catch-up growth in children recovering from malnutrition (2). Furthermore, leptin was considered as an important facilitator in early puberty (3). In addition, findings of leptin deficiency in mice and humans leading to abnormal bone development suggested that leptin plays a novel role in the linear growth of bone (4–7). Endochondral bone formation is the key procedure for growth plate (GP), in which GP chondrocytes undergo a series of organized procedures including proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic differentiation, and calcification (8–10). These complex and delicate programs of endochondral bone formation are responsible for the skeletal elongation. The femoral GP of ob/ob mice is abnormal combined with poorly organized collagen fibril and decreased the expression level of type X collagen (7). Further lab investigations showed that leptin could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of GP chondrocytesex vivo(11). Additional leptin treatment increased condyle height in an organ model (12). Importantly, supplementation of leptin to ob/ob mice could reverse the defects in femoral GP and bone morphology (7,12,13). However, interesting different growth patterns have been shown in ob/ob mice with a shorter femora length and a longer vertebral length than wild-type (WT) mice (7), while the underlying mechanism of this contrasting phenotypes still remains unclear.Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone, affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune system, and neuroendocrine (14,15), each of which could independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone longitudinal growth (16). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deficiency directly leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (17). Estrogen and its receptor (ERα and ERβ) signaling pathway played an essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with that in normal female rats (18,19). Effects of different ERs (α and β) on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which were proved by ER knock-out mice. ERα knock-out mice showed a decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ERβ had increased appendicular bone growth (20–22). Our previous study also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects on the appendicular longitudinal growth (23). Recently, a crosstalk effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation has been reported in our previous study (24), and a stage-specific effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte differentiationin vitro(25). The integration of estrogen and leptin signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in appendicular and axial longitudinal growthviaERs, is still unknown.Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deficiency may influence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GPin vivo, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of leptin deficiency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical techniques to expand our current understanding of how the absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth."

Growing, leptin-deficient\nob/ob\nmice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and\nob/ob\nmale mice.

To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in\nob/ob\nmice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in\nob/ob\nmice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.\nKeywords:\nbone formation and resorption, cartilage, histology, ob/ob, osteoclast",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe appetite regulatory hormone leptin is produced by adipose tissue (Zhang, et al. 1994), circulates in levels proportional to total adiposity (Considine, et al. 1996), and may act to couple skeletal metabolism to energy availability (Gat-Yablonski, et al. 2004;Hamrick 2004;Iwaniec, et al. 2007;Steppan, et al. 2000;Turner, et al. 2013;Turner, et al. 2014). Long bones in leptin-deficientob/obmice are shorter, biomechanically weaker, and exhibit lower overall bone mass and greater marrow adiposity compared to wild type (WT) mice (Ealey, et al. 2006;Iwaniec et al. 2007;Lindenmaier, et al. 2016;Steppan et al. 2000;Turner et al. 2014). However, differences in cancellous bone volume fraction betweenob/oband WT mice vary depending upon skeletal site and age. Leptin treatment in leptin-deficient mice normalizes bone volume and microarchitecture (Iwaniec et al. 2007) by increasing bone formation (Bartell, et al. 2011;Hamrick, et al. 2005;Kalra, et al. 2009;Steppan et al. 2000;Turner et al. 2013) and resorption (Bartell et al. 2011;Philbrick, et al. 2015;Turner et al. 2013;Turner et al. 2014), and increasing longitudinal bone growth (Gat-Yablonski et al. 2004;Iwaniec et al. 2007;Philbrick et al. 2015;Turner et al. 2013). Leptin treatment also normalizes bone marrow adiposity by reducing marrow adipocyte number and size (Lindenmaier et al. 2016). Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin affects bone marrow adiposity and skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover balance.Calcified cartilage provides a structural template for growing long bones during endochondral ossification and is normally replaced by bone during skeletal maturation. However, long bones of leptin-deficientob/obmice retain cartilage within cortical and cancellous bone compartments into adulthood resulting in a mild osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype (Turner et al. 2013;Turner et al. 2014). Osteopetrosis is broadly characterized into two major subtypes, osteoclast-poor and osteoclast-rich (Sobacchi, et al. 2013). Mutations and/or factors that inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis. In contrast, mutations or factors that reduce osteoclast activity but do not inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for the osteoclast-rich form of the disease. Both forms of osteopetrosis result in reduced bone resorption (Arruda, et al. 2016;Unnanuntana, et al. 2011). Severe osteopetrosis is fatal while mild forms, such as that noted inob/obmice, result in decreased bone quality. Furthermore, some forms of osteopetrosis are self-limiting; abnormally high quantities of cartilage are initially present in bone during rapid growth but the cartilage is eventually replaced as skeletal growth slows with age (Cielinski and Marks 1994). At present, it is unclear whether the mild osteopetrosis observed in growingob/obmice is self-limiting.Osteoclast perimeter in ob/obmice is equal to or greater than in WT mice (Hamrick, et al. 2004;Philbrick et al. 2015;Turner et al. 2013;Turner et al. 2014). In contrast, serum levels of carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTx, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption) are generally much lower and fluorochrome label retention in bone (a histomorphometric index of local bone resorption) is higher inob/obmice compared to WT mice, providing strong complementary evidence that leptin deficiency results in reduced bone resorption (Bartell et al. 2011;Turner et al. 2013;Turner et al. 2014). Theoretically, excessive bone formation could contribute to mild osteopetrosis. However, bone formation is impaired by leptin deficiency (Bartell et al. 2011;Hamrick et al. 2005;Philbrick, et al. 2017;Turner et al. 2013;Turner et al. 2014), indicating that lower osteoclastic activity is responsible for the condition inob/obmice.Osteoclast-rich forms of osteopetrosis can be induced by loss of function mutations in genes coding for proteins such as protease cathepsin K or chloride transporter ClCN7 required for osteoclastic activity but not for osteoclast formation and survival (Del Fattore, et al. 2008). Additionally, drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates, have been shown to induce osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis in children (Whyte, et al. 2003). The mechanism for leptin regulation of osteoclast activity has yet to be established but likely involves coordinated actions of the hormone on multiple genes that in concert regulate osteoclast activity. In support, gene profiling has established that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of several genes related to osteoclast differentiation and function (Turner et al. 2014).In the present investigation, we queried the extent to which osteopetrosis inob/obmice is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) WT andob/obmale mice. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy in 2-month-oldob/obmice to restore leptin signaling and evaluated the bone response 7 months later. rAAV gene therapy has been used as an experimental strategy for life-long restoration of leptin signaling in leptin-deficientob/obmice (Iwaniec et al. 2007;Iwaniec, et al. 2009;Kalra et al. 2009)."

        "Title": "Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLeptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female\nob/ob\nmice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC\n50\ninfusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC\n50\n, 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.\nKeywords:\nanimal model, bone formation, osteoblasts, neuroendocrine, bone histomorphometry",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionLeptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is produced primarily by adipocytes and secreted into the vascular circulation in proportion to fat stored in adipose depots (Jequier 2002). Leptin receptors are widely expressed in peripheral tissues and the adipokine can act directly on a variety of cells to regulate their differentiation and metabolism (Anubhuti and Arora 2008;Sainz, et al. 2015). Additionally, the hormone is transported across the blood brain barrier (BBB) where it functions to regulate appetite and energy expenditure (Banks, et al. 1996).Leptin signaling is required for normal bone growth in rodents. Absence of leptin signaling in leptin-deficientob/obmice or leptin receptor-deficientdb/dbmice andfa/farats results in a plethora of skeletal abnormalities, the most common of which are reduced bone length, bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cancellous bone volume fraction, reduced cortical thickness, and reduced cortical and total bone mass (Ealey, et al. 2006;Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008;Hamrick, et al. 2004;Williams, et al. 2011). At the cellular level, these abnormalities are associated with impaired endochondral ossification, lower bone formation due to reductions in osteoblast number and activity, and mild osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast function (Kishida, et al. 2005;Turner, et al. 2013). Not surprisingly, bone mechanical properties are often reduced and bone regeneration impaired in leptin signaling-deficient rodents (Hamann, et al. 2014;Hamann, et al. 2013;Khan, et al. 2013;Picke, et al. 2015;Wallner, et al. 2015).Leptin receptors are expressed on many mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineage-derived cells residing in bone and cartilage, suggesting that the hormone may act locally to regulate skeletal metabolism. However, leptin-deficient rodents also develop morbid obesity, reduced core body temperature, elevated corticosteroid levels, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism, each of which, alone or in combination, may influence bone metabolism through leptin-independent pathways (Iwaniec, et al. 2009;Lindstrom 2007;Saito and Bray 1983). Indeed, equalization of weight gain, blood glucose levels, and energy balance ofob/obto that of wild type (WT) mice worsened the skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency (Turner, et al. 2014). Thus, the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient mice is likely due to perturbation in multiple pathways. Understanding the precise role of leptin in regulating bone growth and maturation is important because in humans low leptin levels are associated with low peak bone mass which in turn is associated with increased fracture risk (Farr and Khosla 2015).A saturable transport mechanism is required for leptin to cross the BBB (Banks et al. 1996). As a consequence, leptin levels in peripheral circulation are typically over 10 times greater than the levels within the brain. The existence of this concentration gradient suggests higher occupancy of leptin receptor in peripheral tissues than brain (Scatchard 1948). We therefore determined the relative responsiveness of bone and other target tissues to circulating leptin levels. This was accomplished by performing a 12-day dose-response study in which physiologically relevant concentrations of the hormone were continuously infused into ob/ob mice using sc implanted osmotic pumps to model leptin production by adipose tissue."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form [3]. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) [4]. Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen [5], and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars [6].Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones [7,8] and adhesion molecules [9]. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues [10], expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation [11] or as part of microbial walls [12], and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking [9]. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages [13] and sinusoidal endothelium [14], which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells [15].Conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as metabolic disturbances and obesity [16], impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs [17]. The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fedMrc1−/−and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTotal-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 10\n6\ncells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice.\nIn vivo\nanalysis and\nin vitro\ndifferentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive Kit\nW/W-v\nmice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kit\nw/wv\nmice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kit\nw/wv\nmice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.",

        "Introduction": "IntroductionLeptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes, serves as a messenger in a feedback loop between adipose tissue and the hypothalamus and contributes to regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure1,2.ob/obmice, homozygous for loss of function mutation in the obesity gene (ob), are unable to generate leptin1,2.ob/obmice become morbidly obese due to the combined influence of increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure1.The physiological actions of leptin extend beyond energy metabolism and include regulation of skeletal growth and maturation3–6; a detailed review of the effects of leptin on the skeleton can be found in Reidet al.7Leptin stimulates endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation and activity in long bones of the lower limb, where the hormone also inhibits differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes8–10. Compared to wild type (WT) mice,ob/obmice have smaller craniofacial dimensions11, shorter long bones12,13and, when evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), have lower total body and femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD)8. Based on microcomputed tomographic (µCT) and histomorphometric analyses,ob/obmice have bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cortical and cancellous bone mass and architecture8,14, and greatly increased levels of marrow adipose tissue (MAT)15,16. Whereas, total and cortical bone mass is normal or lower inob/obmice, cancellous bone mass, depending upon skeletal site and age, can be lower, normal, or higher7. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reverses skeletal abnormalities inob/obmice17. While the literature strongly supports an important role of leptin in increasing bone accrual prior to peak bone mass and in maintaining normal bone turnover, the hormone likely has additional, less well characterized, actions on bone metabolism. In this regard, there is conflicting evidence that leptin plays a role in mediating skeletal response to changes in body weight.Kapuret al. reported leptin signaling to be a negative modulator of bone mechanosensitivity18. Specifically, a loading strain of ∼2,500 μϵ, which was insufficient to produce a bone formation response in B6 mice, significantly increased bone formation parameters in leptin-deficientob/obmice. However, other studies suggest that leptin is required for full expression of positive effects of weight on bone mass. For example, total femur mass is positively associated with body weight in WT mice19. Also, mice heterozygous for theobgene (ob/+ mice) have adipocytes with a reduced capacity to generate leptin but have near normal leptin levels due to compensatory increases in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass19.ob/+ mice exhibit an association between body weight and bone mass nearly identical to WT mice. In contrast, weight differences inob/obmice have a positive but quantitatively smaller effect on bone mass20. Thus, it is possible that leptin is not required for skeletal adaptation to changes in weight but the hormone may enhance the magnitude of response by increasing sensitivity of bone to external loads.If leptin enhances the skeletal response to changes in magnitude of ground reaction forces during weight bearing, leptin-deficientob/obmice would be predicted to exhibit an attenuated bone response to reduced skeletal loading. To test this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of male WT andob/obmice housed at thermoneutral to hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based model for microgravity21. HU unweights the hindlimbs, facilitating investigation of the role of leptin in the skeletal response to changes in weight21. The study was performed at thermoneutral because leptin plays an important role in thermoregulation and mild cold stress induced by conventional room temperature housing results in rapid premature cancellous bone loss in mice22,23. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance to establish the main effects (genotype and skeletal loading status) and their interaction."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.\nKeywords:\nanimal models, sympathetic signaling, thermogenesis, metabolism, bone formation and resorption",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMice are among the most commonly utilized animal models for aging-related metabolic bone disease in humans. Advantages of mice over many models include their small size, relatively short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation. However, differences in physiology between the two species may preclude the direct translation of experimental results from mice to humans (1,2). Although aging-related bone loss occurs in both mice and humans, the temporal pattern of bone loss between the species is markedly different, at least in long bones, raising concern that the underlying mechanisms for the bone loss may differ. In mice, cancellous bone loss in long bones occurs prior to skeletal maturity (6 months of age) and concurrently with bone elongation and cortical bone accrual (3,4). Therefore, by the time mice reach skeletal maturity, defined as cessation of linear bone growth, a large portion of their cancellous bone has been resorbed, and little cancellous bone is available to effectively model aging-related skeletal impairment. This pattern of bone loss is not evident in all small rodents. Cancellous bone loss in rats occurs later in life (5). In humans, cancellous bone loss occurs long after skeletal maturity, primarily due to negative remodeling balance, where the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of formation (6).The mechanism(s) mediating premature cancellous bone loss in mice have not been extensively investigated, but our previous work suggests that the ambient temperature of standard rodent housing (18–23°C) plays an important role (2). We previously reported that housing C57BL/6J (B6) female mice at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevented cancellous bone loss from 8 to 18 weeks of age, an interval during which the mice accrued cortical bone. Compared to standard room temperature housing (22°C), mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption (2).Differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms between mice and humans may be a critical aspect in understanding species-specific skeletal maturation and aging-related bone loss. Humans are homeotherms and maintain their body temperature within a narrow range (7). In contrast, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced decreases in body temperature upon exposure to temperatures below their thermoneutral zone (26–34°C) (8). During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are reduced, laboratory mice, depending on housing conditions (e.g., temperature, bedding material, number of animals/cage), can undergo intermittent bouts of torpor, which is driven by fasting-induced reduction in serum leptin and characterized by a metabolic rate below basal metabolic level and decreased core body temperature (2,8). Conversely, when food intake and locomotor activity are increased during the dark photoperiod, mice utilize energy-requiring adaptive thermogenesis to help maintain sufficient core body temperature, resulting in a net increase in food consumption. Non-shivering thermogenesis, a form of adaptive thermogenesis, is particularly important for adaptation to a cold environment and is regulated by neuroendocrine mechanisms that induce sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), where heat is generated through the uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation by uncoupling proteins (UCPs) (9). Bone is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic neurons (10,11), and catecholaminergic activity modulates the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and may play a role in mediating premature bone loss in mice (12,13).Hormones can directly influence bone health, and sex steroids, in particular, are known modulators of bone metabolism (14). Consequently, female and male mice exhibit sexually dimorphic trajectories of skeletal growth and changes in morphology throughout the lifespan (4). While premature cancellous bone loss occurs in male mice, bone loss appears to occur later than that in females (4). Therefore, in this study we sought to determine if our prior results regarding the effects of housing temperature on bone in female B6 mice were generalizable to male B6 mice. Determining the causes of premature bone loss in mice, and whether this occurs in a sexually dimorphic manner, will contribute to optimization of experimental models more closely matching human physiology and provide novel information on potential factors contributing to aging-related bone loss."

        "Title": "Effects of Spaceflight on Cancellous and Cortical Bone in Proximal Femur in Growing Rats",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.\nKeywords:\nSpaceflight, Proximal femur, Bone microarchitecture, X-ray microtomography/micro-computed tomography, Bone volume/tissue volume, Rat",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionLife on Earth evolved in the presence of a nearly uniform gravitational field (Turner, 2000). Not surprisingly, the near absence of ‘weight’ during orbital spaceflight results in profound adaptive responses in multiple organ systems, including the skeleton. Abnormalities in bone and mineral homeostasis in astronauts during spaceflight result in net bone loss (Sibonga, 2013). Although it is unclear whether the changes in bone metabolism are self-limiting, evidence to date in animals and humans indicates that long-duration space missions will be detrimental to bone.Animal studies, done primarily in rodents, are important for modeling the effects of spaceflight at all stages of skeletal maturation. Studies to date have investigated the effects of spaceflight on bone accrual and turnover balance at a variety of weight bearing, load bearing, and unloaded skeletal sites in growing rodents (Bikle and Halloran, 1999;Turner, 2000). However, the majority of spaceflight experiments using rodents, primarily rats, were performed prior to wide spread availability of x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography (μCT) (Keune et al., 2015). Consequently, limited information is available regarding the effects of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture.The proximal tibia and distal femur are commonly evaluated following spaceflight. In contrast, the effects of spaceflight on proximal femur is much less commonly reported. Bone changes can occur at many skeletal sites but the greatest loss in astronauts is detected in the lower body and, in particular, the proximal femur (Keyak et al., 2009;Lang et al., 2006;Sibonga et al., 2007). In one of the few studies investigating multiple skeletal compartments, we analyzed gene expression in distal epiphysis, distal metaphysis, diaphysis, and proximal region of the femur following a 14-day spaceflight (STS-58) in growing male rats. Notably, we found that the proximal region of the femur exhibited the largest reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins (Evans et al., 1998). Based on this initial observation, we evaluated bone architecture (using μCT) in the proximal region of the femoral head of archived bone specimens from rapidly growing male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41 (Turner et al., 2019), and observed strikingly lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the flight animals. The cancellous osteopenia was a surprise because of the short duration (4 days) of the spaceflight mission. To determine the generalizability of this finding across sex and strain, we assessed bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in archived bone specimens from two additional spaceflight experiments, STS-57 and STS-62. STS-57 was a 10-day mission performed using growing male Fisher 344 rats and STS-62 was a 14-day mission using growing ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats."

We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT.

However, infusion of\nob/ob\nmice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.\nKeywords:\nleptin, BMAT, thermoneutral, room temperature, marrow adipose tissue, histomorphometry",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionBone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As reviewed (1–4), BMAT differs from other adipose depots in that the density and spatial distribution of adipocytes can vary dramatically within and among bones and adipocytes are interspersed among many other cell populations, including hematopoietic lineage cells. The function and regulation of BMAT is incompletely understood but has received considerable recent attention, particularly in regard to its role as a potential regulator of bone metabolism (5,6). In rodents, conditions such as diet-induced obesity, chronic heavy alcohol consumption, severe caloric restriction and microgravity have been reported to result in increased BMAT. Notably, the same conditions are often associated with decreased osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, and bone loss (7–10). Mechanistically, some investigators have hypothesized that differentiation to adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts and/or production of adipocyte-derived adipokines lead to a negative bone turnover balance (11,12). However, a negative relationship between BMAT levels and osteoblasts is far from universal (6,13–15) and, when the relationship occurs, causality has not been established. In total, the experimental evidence to date does not strongly support a deterministic model where reducing BMAT will invariably lead to increased bone mass (1).Mice are commonly used as a mammalian model organism, in part because of their diminutive size, relatively short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation. However, skeletal adaptations do not scale linearly with body size (16). In addition to being physically small, mice are daily facultative heterotherms and have a thermoneutral zone that is much higher than in humans (17). One outcome of this difference in thermoregulation is that mice housed at room temperature (~22°C) experience cold stress. Adaptation to chronic cold stress is recognized to have profound physiological effects that influence disease processes (18,19). In contrast to larger rodents and humans, male and female mice lose cancellous bone in femur and lumbar vertebra well before growth has ceased (20). We have shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing contributes to, and may be fully responsible for, premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Additionally, cold stress in growing mice results in compartment-specific reductions in bone accrual, reduced leptin levels, and decreased accrual of BMAT (21,22).There is strong circumstantial evidence that the adipokine leptin is an important negative regulator of BMAT in mice (23). Compared to C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice, bone growth and turnover are lower and BMAT higher in long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (24–28). Furthermore, treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin by either intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous delivery normalizes bone growth and turnover and reduces BMAT levels (23,25,29,30). On the other hand, there are circumstances where elevated leptin is associated with increased BMAT. For example, compared to mice housed at 22°C, housing B6 female mice at 32°C results in increases in serum leptin and BMAT (31). Additionally, high blood leptin levels in obese rodents are associated with increased BMAT (32). These discrepant findings, where higher levels of leptin can be associated with either increases or decreases in BMAT, suggest that environmental temperature has actions on BMAT that do not require leptin.To better understand the role of leptin as a potential mediator of the response of BMAT to changes in environmental temperature, we performed 2 experiments where we measured BMAT 2 weeks following transfer of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) to near thermoneutral (32°C) housing. It is challenging to house mice at true thermoneutral because the thermoneutral point differs by several degrees between the dark and light photo periods (33). However, a constant temperature of 30-32°C approximates the midrange of thermoneutrality and was shown to prevent cold stress-induced cancellous bone loss in male and female mice as well as result in increased BMAT in female mice (21).In the first experiment, we supplemented 6-week-old female B6 WT mice with leptin, administered for 2 weeks using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump, at 10 µg/d. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food consumption of leptin-supplemented mice. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 WT, leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of treatment."

        "Title": "Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.\nKeywords:\nCold stress, Premature bone loss,\nUcp1\nexpression, Microgravity",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionMice are a commonly used model organism for studying how factors, such as physical activity, influence aging-related bone loss. Mice are typically maintained at housing temperatures of 20–26 °C (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011). However, this temperature range is below the thermoneutral zone for the species and results in cold stress. There is evidence and concern that maintaining mice under sustained cold stress may influence experimental results as well as hinder the translatability of preclinical research findings to human physiology (Speakman and Keijer, 2013;Vialard and Olivier, 2020).In contrast to humans, who are homeotherms and maintain a tight window of core body temperature, mice are facultative daily heterotherms. Because of their small size, mice are more limited in mechanisms for maintaining body temperature than larger animals when subjected to a cool environment, and under some conditions, their body temperature decreases when the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral. The thermoneutral zone for C57BL/6 J mice varies from ~29 to ~34 °C and thermoregulatory responses to subthermoneutral housing follow a diurnal pattern. During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are low, the thermoneutral point for mice is ~29 °C (Škop et al., 2020). If food is restricted during the light photoperiod (e.g., fasting) and the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral, mice enter the hypometabolic state of torpor (Swoap, 2008). During the dark photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are high, the thermoneutral point is ~33 °C (Škop et al., 2020). When the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral during this phase, mice maintain their core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis. One important form of adaptive thermogenesis is non-shivering thermogenesis. During non-shivering thermogenesis heat is produced by a variety of distinct mechanisms, including uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), primarily in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Klingenspor, 2003), and sarcolipin-based thermogenesis, primarily in muscle (Bal and Periasamy, 2020).In addition to its effects on energy metabolism, low ambient temperature may also play a role in the timing and pattern of aging-related bone loss in mice. Our laboratory has shown that housing male and female mice at 22 °C results in cancellous bone loss when the mice are still growing. While the bone loss occurs at multiple skeletal locations, it is particularly severe in the distal femur metaphysis (Iwaniec et al., 2016;Martin et al., 2019), a commonly-evaluated weight-bearing site. We are particularly interested in the issue of bone loss associated with cold temperature in microgravity studies because skeletally mature mice, particularly female mice, have very low cancellous bone volume in their hindlimbs, making it difficult to observe further loss associated with skeletal unloading (Glatt et al., 2007). The bone loss occurring in the distal femur metaphysis in mice housed at room temperature is due to a negative bone turnover balance resulting from a combination of lower bone formation and higher bone resorption, and it is associated with increased sympathetic activity (Turner et al., 2020), which in turn is an important mediator of cold stress-induced adaptive thermogenesis.The reported negative effects of room temperature housing on bone microarchitecture suggest that environmental temperature is an important consideration when using mice for bone research. Additionally, there is concern that the mechanisms mediating cold adaptation may influence experimental results. For example, treatment with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug that induces bone loss, resulted in temperature-dependent effects; specifically, risperidone treatment of female mice housed at 28 °C lowered bone turnover, whereas treatment at room temperature resulted in increased bone resorption (Kunst et al., 2021). Additionally, we have recently shown that cold stress induced by room temperature alters the skeletal response of growing female mice to hindlimb unloading, a ground-based model for microgravity (Wong et al., In Press).While maintaining mice at thermoneutrality is likely the most effective solution for avoiding cold stress-related bone loss, this is not always achievable or desirable. Not all mouse housing facilities are capable of maintaining mice at thermoneutral temperatures and under some conditions (e.g., group housing) thermoneutral housing may be undesirable (Speakman and Keijer, 2013). To date, no detailed temperature response study on bone has been performed in mice. Therefore, it is of interest whether modest increases in housing temperature or standard group housing (up to 5 mice/cage) at room temperature attenuate premature bone loss associated with cold stress in mice.Animal care guidelines recommend housing at temperatures between 20 °C and 26 °C. Mice are housed individually or in groups at ~22 °C but when normal thermoregulation is compromised, such as during hindlimb unloading, warmer housing is recommended (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002). The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether a small (4 °C) difference in temperature (22 °C versus 26 °C) influences bone microarchitecture in growing female mice, and 2) to evaluate how lowering heat loss (5 mice per cage with nestlets) (Gaskill et al., 2013) influences the effect of room temperature housing on bone. The central hypotheses of this study are that 1) increasing temperature will influence bone microarchitecture by reducing cold stress-induced bone loss and 2) lowering heat loss by group housing mice with nestlets will attenuate the effects of room temperature housing on bone."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBone marrow fat is an important depot for short- and long-duration storage of triglycerides. By middle age, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in humans typically contributes 5–10% of total body adipose tissue [1]. Fat depots generally act as dynamic energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although BMAT can be highly labile [2], in contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipocytes often increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during energy deprivation, implying that the bone marrow fat depot does not necessarily function as a traditional energy reservoir for peripheral tissues [3].The physiological function of BMAT as well as its role in chronic disease initiation and progression are topics of current interest and debate [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. We previously reviewed evidence that increased BMAT during fasting reflects an adaptive response to a negative energy balance [14]. An increase in BMAT and the resulting reduction in hematopoietic compartment size during long-duration fasting potentially promotes survival by lowering the energy expenditure required to maintain the turnover of hematopoietic cells. In support, age-related increases in BMAT and decreases in hematopoiesis are reversed by cold temperature stress, blood loss, and infection, conditions with increased requirement for hematopoiesis [15,16,17,18,19].Mesenchymal lineage cells, including adipocytes, often express stem cell factor (kit ligand), the endogenous ligand for the protooncogene kit (CD117). Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on early hematopoietic lineage cells and is required for their differentiation and survival [20]. In addition to regulating hematopoietic cell compartment size, it is possible that lipolysis of triglycerides stored in BMAT provides an energy source for hematopoietic cells. In this regard, Li et al. [21] concluded that BMAT is essential for recovery of the hematopoietic system and bone following exposure to an energy deficit, injury, or high-dose ionizing radiation.Excessive quantities of BMAT may be undesirable and could contribute to skeletal pathologies, including bone loss associated with aging and gonadal insufficiency [22,23]. This possibility is supported by studies showing an inverse relationship between BMAT levels and bone formation as well as between BMAT levels and bone mass [24,25,26,27]. Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells residing in bone marrow, suggesting that an increase in BMAT may reflect a shift in the differentiation program of mesenchymal stem cells from osteoblasts to adipocytes [28].Studies investigating the physiological role of BMAT in skeletal biology and its possible contribution to disease have been largely observational and causality has not been established. We have used mouse models with BMAT deficiency to address some of the limitations of prior research. These include two mouse strains (KitSl/SldandKitW/W-vhaving defects in expression of kit ligand and kit receptor, respectively), that do not accrue BMAT in their long bones or lumbar vertebrae [29]. Using femaleKitW/W-vmice, we showed that the well-established increase in BMAT following ovariectomy had no effect on bone loss [30]. In contrast, BMAT deficiency in maleKitW/W-vmice was associated with enhanced bone loss during hindlimb unloading, suggesting BMAT had a protective action [31]. However,KitW/W-vandKitSl/Sldmouse strains have bone marrow and skeletal abnormalities that could be due to BMAT-independent effects of kit signaling deficiency [30,31,32]. To address this limitation, we have refined the BMAT-deficient mouse models by restoring kit signaling to select tissues, including bone [29,33].The objectives of this investigation were to assess the importance of BMAT following severe injury in (1) supporting hematopoiesis and (2) maintaining bone turnover balance. To accomplish the first objective, we examined the extent of immune reconstitution in lethally irradiated WT and BMAT-deficientKitW/W-vmice after adoptive transfer of purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive Kit+hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To accomplish the second objective, we compared bone microarchitecture, turnover, and cell populations in WT andKitW/W-vmice following irradiation and adoptive transfer of WT HSCs. The experimental protocol is outlined inFigure 1.Figure 1.Open in a new tabExperimental protocol: Mice were randomized into 4 groups: GFP HSC → WT (n = 3), GFP HSC →KitW/W−v(n = 3), WT HSC → WT (n = 10), and WT HSC →KitW/W−v(n = 10), lethally irradiated, and injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. GFP HSC → WT and GFP HSC →KitW/W−vwere maintained for 9 weeks with blood collected at 4 and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) for assessment of GFP+B and T cells.

Fluorochromes were administered 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in WT HSC → WT and WT HSC →KitW/W−vmice to label mineralizing bone matrix.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionBacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [1], hypersaline salt mines and lakes [2,3], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [4], and the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [5]. Bacterial communities have also been found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity, high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment [6]. The microbial communities characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying numerous anti-microbial resistance genes [7,8,9]. This resistance could potentially pose a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as medical attention would not be readily available.Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material (i.e., DNA) between microorganisms through either transformation, conjugation or transduction, and is considered to be central to microbial evolution [10,11]. In dynamic mixed communities, either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall fitness advantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions [12,13,14,15]. In other cases, HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or a neutral one [16], if there is no impact on the fitness of the organism [16].In a recent study comparing bacteria from two extreme built environments, one on Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (International Space Station), a comparison between isolates of the same species showed that those from the International Space Station (ISS) had more mobile genetic elements within their genomes than those from Concordia [17]. In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018 [7], we performed a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically significant correlations were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the stressors of the ISS, specifically microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms, compared to what would be observed on Earth.To address this hypothesis, co-cultures between donor and recipient strains were grown under simulated microgravity (SMG) (which we used as a proxy for µgravity conditions on the ISS) and normal gravity (1G), using the high-aspect-ratio vessel (HARV), with gene transfer tracked using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The donor and recipient strains wereAcinetobacter pittii(strain IIF1SW-P1) andStaphylococcus aureus(strains IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study [8].A. pittiiIIF1SW-P1 was chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin and contained the chromosomally locatedblaOXA-500gene within its genome [7], a beta-lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin [18]. The fourS. aureusstrains, IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to oxacillin and harbored neither theblaOXA-500gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes [7]. The donor,A. pittii,harboredISAba1, a transposable element that can jump between segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region forblaOXAgenes, allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics [19,20].ISAba1was not found in either of the recipientS. aureusstrains. HGT ability was, therefore, tracked betweenA. pittiiandS. aureususing the AMR genes,blaOXA-500andISAba1."

        "Title": "Understanding the Complexities and Changes of the Astronaut Microbiome for Successful Long-Duration Space Missions",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nDuring space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for successful long-term space missions.\nKeywords:\nmicrobiome, spaceflight, space biology, astronaut, human exploration",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHumans have been exploring space for the last sixty-five years and, with the creation of the International Space Station, have been living and working in space continuously for the past 21 years. Astronauts endure many physiological and psychological changes while in space because of altered gravity, radiation, and confinement, to name but a few factors. While some spaceflight side effects are well known, such as bone loss [1], muscle atrophy [2], altered ocular structure [3], cognitive decline [4], fluid redistribution [5] and immune dysregulation [6], others, such as the taxonomic and functional changes of the astronaut microbiome, have been less studied, with the impact on astronaut health even less so. Understanding how the human microbiome adapts to space travel and how this influences astronaut health, pre-, post- and in-flight, is essential in reaching our goal of long-duration human exploration in low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond. This review will discuss changes in the astronaut microbiome as a result of spaceflight (and other stressors pre- and post-flight), how these changes may impact astronaut health, and the resulting consequences for long-duration spaceflight. We also provide recommendations for industry and government entities designing future manned missions to the Moon and Mars on how to incorporate microbiome data into their planning and ways in which the microbiome can be targeted or manipulated to ensure successful long-duration human exploration beyond low Earth orbit."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nFinding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumanity may be tempted to view the cosmos as a rich reservoir of infinite resources. However, the practical reality of space exploration tells a different story. The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefit now and in the long term\"1. Until now, it mainly referred to the need to control, regulate, and remove space debris from low Earth orbit (LEO)2,3and planetary protection (which promotes the implementation and development of the responsible exploration of the solar system, in order to protect the space environments and Earth)3. As humans aspire to venture into deep space, the definition of this concept shifts and expands, and the self-sustainability of mission operations becomes a critical aspect. Loop-closure, which indicates the recycling and the reuse of resources toward the establishment of a circular economy, could greatly enhance the sustainability of space exploration, and it is key not only to minimise the costs of resupply of resources from Earth but also for ethical considerations associated with space waste generation and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments4–10. The United Nations resolved that outer space activities should minimise impacts on the space environment, as well as on Earth, taking into account the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development11,12.The biggest impediment to progress on this frontier is the lack of deployable technologies enabling outposts, extended missions and, in the future, settlements, to sustain themselves through in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and maximised recycling of resources5. In addition to mechanical/physical/chemical approaches, biotechnologies broadly and microorganisms specifically will help enable long-term life-support and habitat systems’ performance (loop-closure), as well as ISRU, manufacturing and energy collection/storage6,7,13–17. Microbiological approaches can be self-sustaining with occasional monitoring and maintenance, owing to their resilience, and could overall require less energy than physicochemical approaches16.Here, we focus on the pivotal roles that microorganisms can play in the development of technologies for sustainable human exploration of deep space, considering two main aspects: (i) the requirement for mature biotechnologies and bioprocesses to allow near closed-loop operations of mission functions, such as life-support, to increase autonomy and sustainability; and (ii) the need to reduce supply chain dependency for the expansion of human presence in space. The approaches presented here are based on processes and technologies currently implemented on Earth at different technology readiness levels (TRL), which must be adapted to meet the specific requirements and challenges of the space environment. Selecting the most suitable bioprocess and most applicable microorganism for any given space application is non-trivial, as terrestrial technologies are rarely readily adaptable to the harsh conditions of space18. Therefore, extensive research and development are compulsory to increase TRL to the point where these technologies can be successfully implemented in space16. Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLocomotion of the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nis a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of\nC. elegans\n—a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns.",

Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage.

The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionNematodes of the genusCaenorhabditisare an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. The most studied organism of this group isCaenorhabditis elegans, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost-effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [1].C. elegansdevelop through four morphologically distinct larval stages (L1 - L4), before progressing into adults. Most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. High-throughput assays such as RNA sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. The standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into L1 larvae that are arrested when starved. The synchronous population of L1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. Embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite (bleach) solution (Fig 1). However, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [2]. To control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high-throughput assays, making the process time-consuming [3–5].Fig 1. Comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos.Open in a new tabBleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. Filtration involves using size-specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. The figure was created using BioRender.To overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [6,7]. Such devices enable precise control of parameters such as liquid flow, pressure, and temperature enabling effective sorting [8]. However, the major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them, making them inaccessible to many groups.Mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to microfluidic devices. Separation ofC. elegansstages by size has been done using filters of different mesh sizes that allow specific stages to pass through and some stages to be retained on top of the mesh (Fig 1), [9]. Filters with different pore sizes are commercially available. For example, Wilson sieves of 5 µm mesh size were used to separate L1 or L2 populations [10], plate-based nylon mesh filters of 11 µm from Millipore MultiScreen were used to purify the L1 stage [11], pluriSelect filters were used to isolate L4 and young adult stages ofC. elegans[9], mesh filters have also been used to separate males from hermaphrodites [12], and in-house filters were also constructed with 50 mL conical tubes and monofilament mesh of the required pore size to recover the L4 stage (on 20 µm filters) and day-one adults (on 50 µm filters) [13].The examples highlight using mesh filters to isolate specific developmental stages ofC. elegans. However, these other size filtration methods are less efficient when scaling beyond one or a small number of strains. Additionally, the small differences in length and width between consecutive larval stages make it difficult to get a 100% pure culture of a specific stage. For example, the difference in width between the L1 and L2 stages, and L2 and L3 stages is approximately 5.3 µm and 5.1 µm respectively (approximate widths of L1, L2, L3, and L4 larvae are 11.7 µm, 17 µm, 22.1 µm, and 29.5 µm, respectively) [6]. In contrast, the dimensions of the embryos (50 µm in length and 30 µm in diameter) make it easier to separate from other developmental stages [14]. Once isolated, the embryos can be cultured to obtain a synchronous population of L1 larvae that can be grown to a synchronized stage-specific population.We used filters from pluriSelect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an OP50-seeded plate. Based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 µm and 20 µm. The 40 µm filter retained adults and debris. The embryos and larval stages, which are smaller in width, passed through the 40 µm mesh and were collected on the 20 µm mesh. The 20 µm mesh further allowed the smaller larval stages to pass through and the embryos to be retained. Using our technique, we recovered approximately 9,500 embryos from one 6 cm OP50-seeded plate, compared to approximately 5,000 embryos by bleach synchronization, using theC. elegansN2 laboratory-adapted strain. To further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the M9 buffer (3% w/v) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three-fold. PEG has been used previously in M9 buffers without adverse effects onC. elegans[15]. Additionally, PEG has been employed for the encapsulation of various organisms, includingC. elegans, with no harmful side effects [16]. We further showed that the embryos obtained by filtration developed into healthier larvae compared to the larvae obtained by bleach synchronization. Furthermore, we found similar or longer (indicating less of an effect) animal lengths after 48 hours of growth from the L1 stage when embryos were collected using filtration compared to bleach and exposed to albendazole, an anthelmintic compound known to inhibit animal development [17]. In summary, we have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization."

Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model\nC. elegans\nis a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the\nC. elegans\nmodel since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in\nC. elegans\n. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.",
        "Introduction": "I. IntroductionSkeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1,2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task. Diagnosis of muscle degenerative disorders such as muscular dystrophy relies on strength and physical performance tests in the clinic3,4. Similar diagnostic evaluation is crucial for, sarcopenia and dynapenia, the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, respectively5,6. Additionally, muscle atrophy and strength declines are a major impediment for manned deep space exploration7.Given conservation of basic muscle biology, simple genetic models such asDrosophila melanogaster8and the 959-celledCaenorhabditis elegans9,10constitute attractive platforms with which to decipher the molecular mechanisms of age-10,11, disease-12, or microgravity-13associated muscle decline. For example, studies inC. eleganshave led to important new insights into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle10,14–16, with the loss-of-function mutants in sarcomeric proteins showing reduced capacity to swim or crawl17–19. These model organisms also offer a powerful means with which to investigate how diet, exercise protocols, and drug interventions may combat muscle dysfunction. Still, the notion of muscle strength and its measurement in these simple models has remained elusive.A technical challenge in reporting muscle strength in invertebrate models is that its definition crucially depends on system geometry and measurement protocol. As a result, even though forces on the order of microNewtons have been reported to be exerted byC. elegans20–26; the approaches used yield different values of forces due to worm locomotion, body posture, and behavior. Without a measurement protocol that is reproducible and system geometry that is validated, fluctuating forces cannot be used to extract a meaningful metric for strength. Additionally, the influence of animal size on force production has not been established, even though it is well recognized that animals from the same culture as well as mutants can have different body sizes. Thus, force measures that reveal muscular strength independent of animal behavior and approaches to compensate forces for variations in animal size, have not been established in theC. elegansmodel.In humans, precisely defined strength metrics such as maximum voluntary force (MVF) and one repetition maximum (1RM) are absolutely essential to quantitate and compare subjects, which constitutes the clinical basis of muscle physiology investigations27(Fig. 1a). Here, MVF is defined as the peak force recorded for a particular set of muscle (leg extensor, elbow extensor etc.) during one trial28,29, and 1RM is defined as the maximum weight that a person can lift for one repetition30. It is imperative to recapitulate analogous metrics and standardize them in theC. elegansmodel for the field to move forward with genetic studies on problems ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to muscle wasting due to aging to metabolic disorders.Figure 1. Muscle strength measurement in humans and the NemaFlex system for force measurement inC. elegans.Open in a new tab(a) Human muscle function is measured in terms of maximum voluntary force (MVF) during a standardized knee extensor test, where the peak force exerted by the quadriceps muscle is recorded using a force sensor.

We study the effects of micropillar forest design and animal behavior to identify robust measurement conditions that define maximum exertable force (MEF) as a measure that is reproducible and insensitive to animal locomotion and behavior. Our force-velocity analysis in animals experiencing different confinements and validation studies using a muscle contracting agent mutants indeed show that MEF is analogous to MVF measured in humans. We also report a scaling factor to correct MEF for animal size, thus establishing NemaFlex as a quantitative and reproducible system for measurement of muscle strength among individual worms, mutants, and/or prospectively in an individual worm with age or experimental intervention. Our findings establish the means to exploit drug, genetic, and experiential outcomes that may define molecular and cellular circuits of muscle use and maintenance, which in turn might inspire therapies for extended muscle healthspan."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nRegular physical exercise is the most efficient and accessible intervention known to promote healthy aging in humans. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nand we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple\nC. elegans\ntissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.",

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpace is an extreme environment in which humans have been routinely living and working for more than 20 years, and ambitions remain to live and work further beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with deconditioning of multiple bodily systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems (Demontiset al.,2017; Strolloet al.,2018). Physiological decline occurs despite participation in exercise countermeasures, which are a potent stimulus to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovascular adaptation (Trappeet al.,2009) and optimal immune function (Simpsonet al.,2015) on Earth. While vestibular adaptations take place in the first days after transition to the microgravity environment, decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems can worsen with missions of greater duration (Fittset al.,2010; Strolloet al.,2018), potentially limiting our capacity for interplanetary missions such as to Mars (Gaffneyet al.,2017).These challenges have motivated research around strategies to prevent this (mal)adaptation in space. As the precise molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning have not been identified, this limits our ability to design molecularly rationalized countermeasures.Biological experiments in space can, however, be methodologically challenging. Although the United States has designated the US segment of the International Space Station (ISS) as a National Laboratory, experiments are not routinely carried out by using standardized equipment or methods that are in common use in other laboratories on Earth. Size, power, mass, late access for experiment integration onto the rocket, and ability to oversee the experiment remain challenges, despite more than 40 years of conducting biology experiments in space. Thus, the development of hardware and the validation of experimental conditions remain critical in the acquisition of quality data that can ultimately promote understanding of biological changes in space that should underpin rationale countermeasures to physiological changes in space.Our current experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), uses the model organism,Caenorhabditis elegans, to explore the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy.C. elegansis an established model organism for studies on Earth (Kaletta and Hengartner,2006; Corsiet al.,2015; Shenet al.,2018) and in space (Szewczyket al.,2008; Higashitaniet al.,2009; Hondaet al.,2012, 2014; Higashibataet al.,2016).In the context of very limited access to space, the short life span and microscopic size ofC. elegansenable data to be collected across the entire life span (Gaffneyet al.,2018a) in highnnumbers and replicates to generate robust data rapidly. The operational requirements of MME include many that apply to biological payloads across species (e.g., late access, temperature-controlled upload/download, and time critical astronaut interventions). MME is therefore a generalizable example of many of the challenges in conducting contemporary astrobiology research onboard the ISS.C. eleganshave been studied in space for more than 20 years by using a variety of spaceflight hardware configurations (Ishioka and Higashibata,2019). With the exception of STS-107 (Szewczyket al.,2005), all past flights involved in the study ofC. eleganshave used nonstandard laboratory hardware. It is therefore not surprising thatC. elegansspaceflight experiments can fail due to lack of sufficient oxygen to support the worms (Warrenet al.,2013), a problem that can be dealt with through preflight ground testing. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation in addition to the ground-based experiment sequence validation testing for MME.The first key challenge was overcoming the difficulty of growing worms inside plastic bags. The second key challenge was working out timings to allow upload to the ISS using passive temperature control. These studies should allow other researchers to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nand mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in\nC. elegans\n. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (\np\n< 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (\np\n< 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as\ndaf-16\nand\naak-2\n(but not\ndaf-2\nor\nakt-1\ngenes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as\nsod-2\n. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of\ndaf-16\nand\naak-2\nmutant worms.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionAging has a significant influence on economy, health, and demography with healthy aging being a global challenge [1]. In 2018, ~16% of the United States population were 65 years old or over and expected to reach 23% by 2060 [2]. Globally, 9% of the population was old (over age 65) in 2019, which is expected to increase to 16% by 2050 [3]. Genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to aging and healthy lifespan. The effects of aging could be altered, and progression of aging could be slowed down [4].Various factors contribute to aging such as defects in development and genetics, environmental factors, diseases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause harmful changes in cells and tissues [5]. Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models [6] such asCaenorhabditis elegans(C. elegans) [7] andDrosophila[8]. Calorie restriction is the most established method for successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such asC. elegans[9,10,11]. However, human studies are scarce [12], and the safety and effectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan extension in humans is controversial [1]. Therefore, it is critical to identify dietary bioactive compounds that reduce ROS levels and thereby delay aging.Among the pathways and genes involved in lifespan regulation, DAF-16 is homologous to mammalian forkhead box O1 (FOXO) transcription factor, and a key lifespan extension transcription factor that is highly conserved across a variety of organisms such as flies, worms, rodents, and humans [12,13].C. elegansDAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated by DAF-16/FOXO signaling [14]. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan ofC. elegans[15]. In addition to these major pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity [16]. High ROS activity has been shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans,C. elegans, andDrosophila[7,17,18,19]. Finally, in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate different signaling and metabolic pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression [20].Dietary intervention is one of the effective non-genetic or pharmacological means to combat aging [21]. Botanicals like cranberry, strawberry, blueberry, sweet cherry, tart cherry, and curcumin all contain biologically active polyphenols, which may protect against diseases and promote health in animals, humans, and model organisms [22,23,24]. Moreover, cranberry [8,13,25], mulberry [26], and blueberry anthocyanins increase lifespan ofC. elegansandDrosophilavia different pathways [17,27,28]. Out of these, Montmorency tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains high concentration of anthocyanin flavonoids, and its consumption is known to provide numerous health benefits by reducing inflammation and production of ROS [29,30] as well as protecting against diabetes [31], cardiovascular diseases [32], muscle pain [33], and cancer [34].Tart cherry (TC) possess increased antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro [35]. However, the mechanisms by which TC reverses effects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the effects of TC extract (TCE) on aging and healthspan, we used the nematodeC. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research [36] because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental flexibility, and rapid turnover [37]. Furthermore,C. elegansbehavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals, including humans [27]. Additionally, 83% ofC. elegansproteome shows homology to the human proteome, and both humans and nematodes share significant age-related characteristics that can be used to study effects on health and aging [21,38].In this paper, we determined mechanisms by which TCE extends lifespan inC. elegansusing microfluidic devices for whole-life culture studies that allow efficient drug delivery compared to animals reared on agar-plates [39,40,41]. We demonstrated that TCE extends lifespan and healthspan ofC. elegansby influencing the major DAF-16/FOXO lifespan regulating pathway. Consistent with this finding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our findings reveal protective anti-aging effects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet."

        "Title": "A region of UNC-89 (obscurin) lying between two protein kinase domains is a highly elastic spring required for proper sarcomere organization",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn\nC. elegans\n,\nunc-89\nencodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy\nin vitro\ndisplays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.\nKeywords:\nsarcomere, giant polypeptides, UNC-89, obscurin,\nC. elegans",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionC. elegansUNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegansgeneunc-89result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines [1–3].unc-89is a complex gene: through the use of three promoters and alternative splicing at least 16 polypeptides are generated, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da [3–5]. Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg laying and intestinal muscles [3], and several gonadal epithelial cells [6]. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B and UNC-89-F, consist of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line [3,4]. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, our lab has systematically identified its binding partners. We have screened a yeast two hybrid library with segments representing the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners, and 6/7 have orthologs or homologs in humans [7–13]. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes.Mammalian striated muscle express three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes, obscurin (OBSC), obscurin-like 1 (obsl1) and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG). UNC-89 is most similar to obscurin [14,15], which also expresses many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains [16]. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line, or the Z-disk [15,17]. Mutations in the human OBSC gene result in cardiomyopathies (HCM, DCM, LVNC)[18]. In addition to serving as a platform for assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin localized to the SR [19,20]. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR [21]. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-89 [22]. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks and intercalated disks [23]. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line [24]. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, global KO is embryonic lethal and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)[25]. SPEG also exists as different sized isoforms, but the largest isoform is 3,267 aa and consists of 9 Ig and 2 Fn3 domains, and 2 protein kinase domains [26]. It can be regarded as similar to the C-terminal tandem kinase domain regions of obscurin and UNC-89. SPEG is located in a complex lying between the SR and plasma membrane (JMC) in cardiomyocytes. In the mouse, cardiac-specific KO results in DCM, whereas mutations in human SPEG result in centronuclear myopathy with DCM [26]. Thein vivosubstrates for the kinase domains of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG are not known. However, sequence analysis suggests that: (i) UNC-89 PK1 is catalytically inactive, whereas PK2 is an active kinase [27]; (ii) human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases [27], and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylationin vitro[28]. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro [28]. There is a suggestion that SPEG phosphorylates the JMC protein junctophilin 2 [29].As shown inFig. 1A, UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG have an overall conservation in organization around the kinase domains: PK1, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig, Fn, and PK2. There is very little sequence homology amongst the non-domain or “interkinase” (IK) regions of these proteins (Supplemental Figure 1). However, these IK regions have in common, a low sequence complexity, high proline content (11.8—13.3%), and an overall paucity of predicted α-helix and β-strands, and thus are likely to be predominantly random coils [9]. These properties of the IK regions are shared with the known highly elastic spring regions of human titin (PEVK and N2A/B)[30]. In this paper, we describe, for nematode UNC-89, the response of the interkinase to mechanical pulling and the phenotype of worms in which the interkinase has been deleted in-frame. This is the first time the function of this region has been explored for any member of the UNC-89/obscurin family.Fig. 1.

        "Title": "NemaLife chip: a micropillar-based microfluidic culture device optimized for aging studies in crawling C. elegans",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nthat allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (\ndaf-2\n,\nage-1\n,\neat-2,\nand\ndaf-16\n) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (\nage-1\nand\ndaf-16\n). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in\nC. elegans\n.\nSubject terms:\nCaenorhabditis elegans, Lab-on-a-chip, Ageing",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAging is a significant risk factor for a broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer1–5. With the growing aging population, the socioeconomic burden attributed with age-associated diseases is staggering and development of therapies that promote healthy aging is imperative.C. elegansis a powerful model organism for aging investigations with a short lifespan (3–5 weeks), genetic similarity with humans (~ 38% orthologs6) and conserved signaling pathways7. Additionally, a fully mapped genome8and genetic plasticity9,10makes C.elegansan attractive tool for aging studies. Advances in fluorescent microscopy11and genomic technology (RNAi, CRISPR)12,13have further expanded the number of possible ways in which C.eleganscan be used to study healthy aging.Lifespan analysis has become a widely used method for evaluating the effects of various genes, proteins, and drug compounds on aging and age-associated diseases. In general, lifespan assays are carried out withC. elegansreared on agar plates containing nematode growth media (NGM). During the reproductive phase, adults must be manually transferred to new plates to separate progeny from the original sample. These animal transfers significantly increase the effort and time required for conducting lifespan assays. To reduce the work costs of manual transfers, many labs utilize a strong progeny-blocking drug (2′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, FUdR) to maintain an adult-only population14–16. An alternative to this approach is the use of sterile mutants17–20.The simplicity of using FUdR or sterile mutants has led to new technologies for large-scale lifespan analysis inC. elegans. A technology known as Lifespan Machine (LSM), allows for the rapid analysis of a population of thousands of animals grown on agar supplemented with FUdR using automatic capture of sequential images to score animal death and determine lifespan21. The LSM technology has provided insights into temporal scaling of ageing dynamics21,22and helped identify chemical compounds with robust longevity effects23. Similarly, WorMotel technology facilitates longitudinal analysis of individuals in agar-filled microfabricated well plates24. In a recent addition, WormBot technology employed robotic platform to image and measure lifespan of animals cultured on agar surface in a 24-well plate25.Although powerful, LSM, WorMotel, and WormBot technologies have some limitations. The useof FUdR is undesirable as FuDR has been shown to activate stress response pathways26,27, alter body size14, increase superoxide dismutase levels28, increase fat accumulation29and alter the survival of worms with specific genetic backgrounds27,29,30. Moreover, the timing of FUdR treatment is critical, such that premature supplementation of FUdR results in abnormalities such as a high percentage of vulval protrusion, also known as age-related vulval integrity disorder (AVID)14,15. Another issue with the LSM and WorMotel technologies is the difficulty in studying the effect of temporal changes in environment on lifespan since these require transferring of animals to new plates. Such temporal manipulations have been central to studies of dietary restriction31and functional cognitive aging32. In addition, uptake of drugs by animals maintained on plates is an ongoing challenge33.In recent years, microfluidic approaches have begun to address the limitations of agar-based lifespan assays34–38. Several key advantages of using PDMS-based microfluidics include (1) excellent permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, enabling animals to experience natural atmospheric conditions39; (2) size-based separation of animals using on-chip filters34–36, eliminating the need to prevent or reduce progeny production; (3) precise temporal control of culture environment via addition or removal of reagents35,36; (4) overall reduction in the number of censored worms; and (5) optical transparency of devices to enable bright field and fluorescence imaging.Significant advantages of microfluidics has led to the development of lifespan-devices for measuring survival curves34–36,38. However, a major drawback of prior devices is thatC. elegansswims in the engineered chambers, similar to liquid cultures in multiwell plates. Physiologically, swimming in liquid culture is more energetically demanding than crawling40,41. In liquid environments,C. eleganscan exhibit swimming and quiescent states42, making lifespan outcomes in liquid culture difficult to interpret. Also, housing worms in liquid culture for a significant portion of their lifespan has been shown to induce gene expression changes40,43and oxidative stress40. Taken together, these findings suggest that conducting whole-life studies in microfluidic chambers where animals swim may not be representative of the physiology that crawling animals experience on plates40,41,44. In addition, measures such as pharyngeal pumping which can be predictive of healthspan45–47are difficult to score in swimming animals.Given the importance of mimicking plate-like behaviors in microfluidic devices, several studies have incorporated micropillars in microfluidic chambers and showed that the pillar arrangement can be configured to achieve locomotory gait similar to that on agar plates48–52. Additional studies have used these microstructured devices to study chemotactic behaviors50, separate different larval-stage animals53and perform stress assays54. Thus, micropillar devices are well suited to induce plate-like crawling behaviors; however, to date, whole-life culturing ofC. elegansin micropillar environments has not been demonstrated and their suitability for measuring survival curves remains to be ascertained.Here we report an optimized microfluidic device, termed NemaLife Chip, for whole-life studies inC. elegansthat addresses the limitations of agar-based approaches and microfluidic swim-chambers. The device has sieve channels to retain adults but enable progeny removal by fluid flow. Since previous micropillar devices have not been configured for life-long culture and survival outcomes, we optimize food concentrations and feeding frequency. Importantly, we show that whole-life culturing ofC. elegansin chambers without pillars induces deleterious health effects. Furthermore, we show that the use of a micropillar housing arena increases the efficiency of scoring various health span metrics, including pharyngeal pumping and locomotory phenotypes. Validation of NemaLife chip through the analysis of established aging mutants, RNAi studies, and various culture conditions demonstrates that this new microfluidic device provides a simple platform with the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of genetic and environmental regulators of healthy aging."

        "Title": "Spaceflight affects neuronal morphology and alters transcellular degradation of neuronal debris in adult Caenorhabditis elegans",
        "Abstract": "Graphical Abstract\nOpen in a new tab",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumankind as long been fascinated by space exploration. Yuri Gagarin first showed in 1961 that humans could survive in space, and Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin became the first to walk on the moon in 1969. Now, the International Space Station (ISS), a multinational collaborative station that orbits Earth, has been continuously occupied with crew since November 2000. Into the future, both governmental space agencies and private companies plan to send crewed missions to Mars and beyond. Research to date, however, makes evident that spaceflight poses health risks to the human body, including detrimental effects to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018;Fitts et al., 2001;Shen and Frishman, 2019;Sibonga, 2013;Williams et al., 2009). Particularly striking is the loss of up to 20% of muscle mass in short-duration spaceflights (Adams et al., 2003;Edgerton et al., 1995), which can be ameliorated by regular physical exercise (Loehr et al., 2015). Much less is known about the effects of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especiallyin vivoand at the single-neuron level. Given the impracticality of conducting such studies in humans, the use of animal models in which detailed high-resolution neuronal analyses can be performed is invaluable for assessing conserved neuronal responses to spaceflight and developing effective countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of long-duration missions.The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis a genetic model widely used in neurobiology, aging, and stress research that is amenable for assessing the effects of spaceflight on neuronal biology given its unique advantages: ease of culture in large numbers due to its microscopic size; a transparent body that permitsin vivoimaging of multiple tissues, single cells, and even cellular organelles; and a short lifespan (2–3 weeks) that allows for even a short-duration spaceflight mission to correspond to a large portion of theC. eleganslifetime. Importantly, the spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy observed in humans is conserved inC. elegans, as several studies reported a downregulation of muscular components in space-flown nematodes (Adenle et al., 2009;Higashibata et al., 2006,2016;Selch et al., 2008). The agingC. elegansmusculature also displays the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength that contributes to human frailty) (Herndon et al., 2002), and physical exercise inC. elegansmimics human exercise by inducing multi-systemic health benefits (Hartman et al., 2018;Laranjeiro et al., 2017,2019). In addition to muscle changes, space-flownC. eleganshave altered metabolism and differential expression of longevity-related genes (Adenle et al., 2009;Higashibata et al., 2016;Honda et al., 2012;Selch et al., 2008). TheC. elegansnervous system is composed of exactly 302 neurons, each one with a well-described morphology. Thus, transgenic nematodes in which neuronal subpopulations are fluorescently labeled allow forin vivosingle-neuron assessments that are virtually impossible in the highly complex mammalian brain.Here, we show that adultC. elegansthat lived 5 days on the ISS exhibit morphological changes in two distinct types of sensory neurons when compared to ground control animals. We identify hyperbranching as a common response of adult neurons to spaceflight. We also studied proteostressed touch neurons with a focus on a formerly unrecognized mechanism by whichC. elegansneurons can extrude large membrane-surrounded vesicles that contain neuronal waste (e.g. protein aggregates and damaged organelles) (Arnold et al., 2020;Melentijevic et al., 2017). On Earth, the extruded neurotoxic components are, in most cases, efficiently degraded by the surrounding tissues, which in the case studied is the nematode hypodermis (Arnold et al., 2020;Melentijevic et al., 2017). We find that, under spaceflight conditions, proteostressed neurons are associated with a striking accumulation of neuronal debris in the surrounding tissues not apparent in ground controls, indicating a severe dysregulation in the ability to clear neuronal waste in space-flown, middle-aged animals. Our results reveal spaceflight-associated challenges to systemic proteostasis and underscore the need to carefully assess the cellular consequences of long-duration spaceflight as strategies to maintain health are developed."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nis a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of\nC. elegans\n(Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in\nC. elegans\n.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAmong the many pathophysiological changes that occur during human spaceflight, muscle atrophy is significant and remains a major impediment to deep space exploration1,2. The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions. Even a weeklong stay at the International Space Station (ISS) can lead to degradation in muscle mass and peak power; this loss could be fatal in off-nominal landing scenarios where assistance might be unavailable. Loss of muscle strength can pose an even more serious problem for interplanetary travel, such as with a venture to Mars, which could take 200 to 300 days.Generally, reduced workload in a microgravity environment is considered to be a primary cause of muscle loss in response to spaceflight3–5. However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role6,7. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles8–10. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day. Even with these current countermeasures, the loss in muscle mass is up to 20% during a 5-day to 2-week-long flight, whereas for a long-duration space mission (3 to 6 months), a loss of 30% is noted3,11. In most cases, muscle mass and strength can be regained within a few months to years after returning to Earth by a combination of adapted exercise and rehabilitation11,12. Nevertheless, muscle maintenance in space is still a major concern, and no effective preventive measures exist beyond the limited benefit obtained through exercise. Thus, it is important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle strength in spaceflight and develop appropriate countermeasures.In previous studies, it was shown that alteration in gene expression (e.g., in genes encoding myosin heavy chain kinase and other cytoskeletal proteins) in response to microgravity is similar in cultured embryonic muscle cells1, animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate), and humans10,13. These similarities provide strong motivation for investigating the effect of spaceflight conditions on muscles using invertebrate animal models, thus avoiding the cost and time expense associated with experiments using vertebrates. Indeed, the invertebrate model organism,Caenorhabditis elegans(C. elegans), has been recognized as an excellent model system for space biology research and has been flown in several spaceflight investigations14–19.TheC. elegansmodel presents several advantages for spaceflight studies. Up to 40% of its genes are homologous to human genes20,21, and a large library of genetic mutants22and strains with fluorescent reporters are available. The body wall muscles ofC. elegansare functionally analogous to vertebrate muscle, as they include dense bodies and M-lines, the former being functionally equivalent to vertebrate Z-lines. In addition, the nematode is small (≈1 mm), weight is miniscule (≈1 μg), has a short lifespan (≈20 days), fast generation time (∼1 week), and is easy to grow. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations,C. elegansexperimental payloads offer a small form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and existing strain resources makeC. elegansa leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies.On Earth, adultC. eleganscultured in liquid media tend to sediment, indicating that animals experience gravitational stresses23,24. In microgravity, gravitational effects are significantly weaker, which altersC. elegansphysiology13. In prior spaceflight experiments withC. elegans, it was found that approximately 150 muscle genes were downregulated inC. elegansduring 10 days of culture in microgravity13,25. Among the detected downregulated muscle genes were key motor protein genes such as MyoD and myosin heavy chain, and two genes (unc-97andunc-112) that encode members of a muscle attachment complex13. Members of the attachment complex (called the costamere in humans) have been shown in humans to increase expression and activity with increased mechanical load and decrease expression and activity in response to immobilization. Thus, muscle attachment genes play an important role in processes leading to muscle loss. InC. eleganson Earth, decreased expression of these genes via acute RNAi treatments results in movement defects and various subcellular defects within the muscle (e.g., disorganization and collapse of arrayed sarcomeres)26.A key open question is if and how the changes in muscle gene expression observed in spaceflight result in decreased muscle strength. While decreased force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated forC. eleganscultured in microgravity. Several studies have used elastomeric micropillars to measure muscle forces inC. elegans27–29, and we have recently standardized a microfluidic device and approach for obtaining the maximum exertable force, providing a measure of nematode muscle strength. This strength measurement apparatus is called NemaFlex30,31and consists of a microfluidic chamber with microfabricated deformable pillars. The force produced by a nematode moving between the pillars is evaluated from the pillar deflections observed under a microscope. The NemaFlex device and the force measurement protocol have been optimized such that muscle strength is independent of behavior and gait. The device is also capable of detecting strength differences in mutants with defects in muscle genes31,32. The NemaFlex device is miniaturized and simple to use, and thus has potential forC. elegansspaceflight experiments.In this study, we address technical challenges for conducting multi-generationalC. elegansstrength measurements in microgravity. These technical challenges include culturing of animals across several generations, obtaining nearly age-synchronized animals of a given size for strength measurements, establishment of an imaging protocol for recording pillar deflections, and development of an on-orbit protocol for experimentation that minimizes crew time and ensures astronaut safety on the ISS. Addressing these technical challenges, we report a reconfigured spaceflight ready NemaFlex device (referred to as NemaFlex-S), new protocols for experimentation withC. elegans, and a custom-designed hardware for on-orbit operation of NemaFlex-S on the ISS. This integrated technology and protocols enabled its successful operation by astronauts on the ISS producing significant visual data ofC. elegansacross multiple generations."

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWhole-organism phenotypic assays are a foundational tool for basic biology investigations, drug screening and disease-focused studies [1,2,3,4]. The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis particularly relevant for phenotypic screening due to its small size (≈1 mm), fast reproductive cycle (≈3 days), short lifespan (≈3 weeks), amenability to genetic manipulation and significant translational relevance [5,6,7]. Its small size and ease of culture offer the ability to phenotype large populations offering statistical power, which can be a challenge with vertebrate models. Whole-organism phenotypic readouts inC. eleganstypically involve examining animal behavior, locomotory prowess and survival in response to changes in environment [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15].The numerous advantages that underscore the use ofC. elegansas a genetic model on Earth also translate to its use in spaceflight as a cost-effective organism to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure on astronaut health. Indeed,C. eleganshave been flown several times to the International Space Station (ISS) [16,17,18,19,20]. The conducting of animal experiments on the ISS is associated with stringent operational requirements on payload size, weight, crew time and safety [21,22].C. elegansoffers a facile means to address these requirements, making it an efficient model for space-biology investigations.Standard microscopes have been the workhorse for image-based whole-organism phenotyping inC. elegans. The need to increase assay throughout and reduce costs has led to the development of a variety of bespoke imaging solutions. Approaches range from the use of scanners for parallel imaging of nematodes on agar plates [23,24] to compact do-it-yourself (DIY) systems based on Raspberry Pi cameras [25,26,27] and smartphones [10,28,29]. Scanners offer a convenient means to increaseC. elegansassay throughout, but are bulky and generate heat that requires significant customization to maintain temperature during the assay [23]. The Raspberry Pi camera approach offers on-board computation, making it attractive; however, it requires an external display for viewing and keyboard, which can be cumbersome, especially for ISS experiments.The smartphone microscopy approach has promise to create compact, portableC. elegansimaging systems with high-resolution displays and on-board computation. Current methods focus on high-magnification and multi-contrast imaging ofC. elegans, lending to the inclusion of optical and mechanical elements [10,26,28,29]. These elements increase the complexity of the optical configuration and system size/weight. Considerations on power requirements, parallel experimentation and assay temperature control have received less attention, which are essential for spaceflight studies. SinceC. elegansassays are conducted in a variety of substrates, compatibility with these substrates will broaden the utility of such compact systems. Finally, thorough validation and mutant phenotypic data needs to be generated from smartphone microscopy studies that will lower barriers for adoption in research and educational settings.In this study, we report a small foot-print smart-device imaging system called Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) that can acquire videos ofC. elegansin agar plates, liquid droplets on a glass slide and microfluidic devices. The system has no external optical or mechanical elements, thereby reducing the complexity for imaging. The CIP is powered by USB and can be housed in standard incubators offering a plug-and-play approach for science investigations on Earth and in space. We conducted validation and mutant studies on Earth to show the promise of CIP forC. elegansphenotypic assays."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nLiving longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H\n2\nS) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H\n2\nS concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH\n2\nS) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using a\nCaenorhabditis elegans\naging model, we compared untargeted H\n2\nS (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH\n2\nS (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H\n2\nS donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH\n2\nS donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH\n2\nS (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H\n2\nS doses. mtH\n2\nS preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H\n2\nS metabolism enzymes and FoxO/\ndaf-16\nprevented the positive health span effects of mtH\n2\nS, whereas DCAF11/\nwdr-23\n– Nrf2/\nskn-1\noxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH\n2\nS treatments. Adult mtH\n2\nS treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the\nelt-6\n/\nelt-3\ntranscription factor circuit. H\n2\nS health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings.

Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.\nMethods\nUsing\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nas a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP‐tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAge‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations1and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity.2Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions3and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality,4efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited.Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia.5However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub‐optimal,6and certain older individuals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to exercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physically inactive,7meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side‐effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long‐term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease8but is a potent immunosuppressant9unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery.Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle.10Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation,11while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions.12Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle‐bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health,13with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together.14Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular first‐line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display significant increases in muscle strength15and total muscle mass.16Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia,17Duchenne muscular dystrophy18and denervation‐induced muscle atrophy.19Retrospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit significant increases in total lean muscle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated controls.20In the ageing context, ZA‐treated fruit flies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular ageing.21However, the direct anti‐sarcopenic efficacy of ZA has not been established.The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age‐related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle.22C. elegansmuscle is also highly morphologically and metabolically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60–85%) of sub‐muscular systems with people.23As with fruit flies,C. elegansare invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (‘osteokines’).24C. elegansare, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle‐specific mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone‐derived confounders. We thus employedC. elegansas a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone‐independent effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near‐term applicability in the clinic."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground:\nUnderstanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionAs a species, we have been working and living in space for more than 60 years, with continuous occupation for the last 23 years via the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. During this time, we have discovered that spaceflight induces numerous physiologic alterations, including but not limited to muscle and bone loss, structural changes in the eyes and brain, altered cardiovascular function, and altered cognitive function [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In some cases, we have developed effective countermeasures for these undesirable outcomes, but in other cases, understanding and countering the causes of these outcomes remain active areas of investigation. For example, adequate exercise and nutrition are sufficient to limit bone and muscle loss in astronauts onboard the ISS [10]. In contrast, causes of and countermeasures for alterations in the brain remain active areas of research [11]. As research advances, it has become increasingly clear that there are some molecular hallmarks of spaceflight [12], which include mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and epigenetic changes. Current challenges of space life sciences research include linking these molecular alterations to the physiologic ones as well as to the known spaceflight hazards. These hazards include distance from Earth, confinement, being in a hostile and closed environment, altered gravity, and increased and altered radiation exposure [12,13,14].With our increased presence in space, our ability to conduct space medicine continues to improve. For example, we now understand that improved skin care is needed in flight due to the frequency of skin rashes [15]. Currently, there is an increased interest in personalized approaches for optimizing astronaut health [16,17,18,19,20]. For example, exercise and nutrition can be individually tailored to prevent muscle loss in flight [10,21]. The success of these approaches on Earth, combined with the increased use of -omics data in terrestrial medicine, has also led to using -omics approaches in astronauts [17,21,22,23]. While still in its infancy [24,25,26], it seems clear that combining -omics data from space-flown model organisms, such asC. elegans,Drosophila, and rodents, with astronaut data can accelerate the discovery process, in part by compensating for the current rarity of human space -omics datasets [22,27]. For example,C. elegans, rodents, and humans all display alterations in insulin-linked gene expression in response to spaceflight [28]. Given the central role of insulin in human health and longevity on Earth [29], it is highly likely this system is equally important to maintain in space. Indeed, recent data from space-flown rodents confirm that the liver–muscle axis is central to regulating both global metabolic health and muscle health functions the same in space as on Earth and that its perturbation may contribute to both liver and muscle pathology in flight [30].While our advances in fundamental space life sciences and space medicine have been substantial, these are largely limited to habitation in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With planned government and commercial missions beyond LEO (BLEO), understanding fundamental changes to biological systems and countermeasures to detrimental alterations at new destinations, such as the Moon and Mars, are emerging challenges [31]. For example, current exercise countermeasures for maintaining muscle on the ISS are not feasible on currently planned spacecraft due to size constraints [32]. Similarly, storing adequate nutrition further away from Earth is operationally challenging [33,34,35]. Thus, despite not being a current priority for research on the ISS, understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy in space remains important for these new exploration class missions.Currently, designing space biology experiments for BLEO means that the experiments must be small and autonomous [36,37,38]. For example, using a CubeSat, such as Biosentinel [39], as a passive or mostly passive payload on Artemis [40], or an autonomous instrument on a Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission [41]. Thus, using standard flight genomic model organisms [27] that are small, such as bacteria, yeast,C. elegans, orDrosophila,is feasible. In terms of muscle strength, a microfluidic device has been developed for assessing strength inC. elegans[42], and this has been successfully used to both demonstrate decreased strength in mutants with defective muscle structure [43,44,45] and to identify drugs to improve strength both in muscle mutants [46] and with age [47]. Thus, the use ofC. elegansfor studying and countering muscle strength decline on the Moon is technically feasible, albeit challenging.The use ofC. elegansin space biology has recently been reviewed [48,49,50]. Notably, past studies have demonstrated conserved gene expression changes in response to spaceflight betweenC. elegans, rodents, and humans. These include declines in muscle contractile genes [51], mitochondrial genes [12,52], and insulin signaling [28,53]. The knockdown of these genes on Earth is sufficient to induce strength decline [45,46]. Therefore, we hypothesized that worms would be weaker in space and aimed to directly test this on the micro-16 ISS payload, flown starting in February 2021 (NG-15 launch). The results from our experiment pave the way for testing pharmaceutical and nutrient countermeasures for strength decline in spaceflownC. elegans,as well as for testingC. elegansmuscle strength at various BLEO destinations."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThroughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions.As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17.In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionMuscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 inC. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions.Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegansgeneunc-89result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9.unc-89is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11(WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared.The Drosophila genome contains a singleunc-89gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies.Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19.Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924.Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26.Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1.PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231.So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability ofC. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.\nKeywords:\nviability, microarray, 454 pyrosequencing, PMA, PhyloChip,\n16S rRNA\ngene",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMicrobial cells are traditionally classified as either viable (maintaining active metabolism and membrane integrity), viable but dormant (because of external pressures) or non-viable (dead) (Kaprelyantset al., 1993;Keer and Birch, 2003). The vast majority of microorganisms cannot be cultivated and many that can require long cultivation times (Amannet al., 1995). To minimize the time spent in determining viability and bias associated with such analyses, advanced molecular approaches for assessing cellular viability have been recently developed, including live–dead staining (Bouloset al., 1999) and flow cytometry-based techniques (Ben-Amoret al., 2005). In such cases, however, there is inherent risk of overestimating the total number of viable cells in samples because of variation in binding affinities of the dyes used. Methods probing RNA as an alternative to DNA have also been developed for assessing viability (DeAngeliset al., 2011), but these too come with complications as RNA is difficult to purify, less stable, prone to degradation and often isolated in quantities insufficient for analysis (Hierroet al., 2006;Andorraet al., 2010).The development of high-throughput pyrosequencing and phylogenetic microarray techniques has dramatically increased the resolution and detectable spectrum of diverse microbial lineages from environmental samples (Soginet al., 2006;La Ducet al., 2009;Mendeset al., 2011). However, DNA-based molecular technologies alone have yet to be validated for assessing the differential viability of cells across varying phylogenetic lineages in a complex microbial assemblage. DNA-derived signals, which originate from both living and dead cell types, often lead to interpretations that overestimate the viable microbial population present (Rogerset al., 2008;Pointinget al., 2009). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based analyses increase the speed, sensitivity and specificity of quantitative microbial detection (Hierroet al., 2006;Yanezet al., 2011). Unfortunately, qPCR techniques alone cannot differentiate live from dead cells, as the latter contribute template DNA to the overall PCR amplification (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008). The persistence of nucleic acids post-cell death renders cogent estimations of live–dead cellular ratios in a given sample practically impossible, as naked DNA will ultimately result in the overestimation of total cells (Nockeret al., 2006).The treatment of microbial cell suspensions with propidium monoazide (PMA), which first intercalates and on photo-activation, covalently binds DNA, before DNA extraction followed by downstream PCR and related molecular analyses has become an increasingly popular technique for the selective detection and enumeration of viable microbes (Heinet al., 2006;Nockeret al., 2006;Wagneret al., 2008;Bae and Wuertz, 2009). The use of PMA for discriminating live from dead cells has been studied across various applications and research testbeds, including food (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008), biosolids (van Frankenhuyzenet al., 2011), infectious enteric viruses in water samples (Parshionikaret al., 2010), fungi (Vesperet al., 2008), bacteriophage T4 (Fittipaldiet al., 2010), infectious parasitic protozoa (Bresciaet al., 2009) and wastewater treatment plants (Linet al., 2011). Recently, PMA treatment has been used in combination with crude microarray analysis for assessing cell viability (Nockeret al., 2009). In addition, pyrosequencing profiles of water samples exposed to high temperature and treated with and without PMA have been comparatively analyzed (Nockeret al., 2010).The development and validation of molecular methods to selectively detect and enumerate the living fraction of the microbial population resident on critical surfaces (for example, hospital operating rooms, pharmaceutical manufacturing and packaging facilities, semiconductor fabrication, and spacecraft assembly cleanrooms) is of immense importance to good manufacturing practices aimed at minimizing contaminant bioburden levels. Reported here for the first time are the results of pioneering efforts coupling PMA-based viability discrimination with innovative PhyloChip DNA microarray and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) methodologies to assess the viable bacterial population present in a typical low-biomass environmental sample."

        "Title": "Microbial existence in controlled habitats and their resistance to space conditions",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to global public health and years of progress made towards ending TB have been reversed by the COVID19 pandemic [1]. Predictive preclinical models for testing novel drugs and vaccine candidates are required to achieve the targets set forth in the End TB Strategy.Laboratory mice have played a critical role in TB preclinical therapy development and studies ofMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) immunopathology. However, they do not always align closely with clinical observations [2,3]. Most of the common mouse strains used in research have been inbred for many decades under specific pathogen-free conditions in a controlled environment without dietary variations that led to a loss in microbiota diversity and richness [4]. Moreover, laboratory animals are not exposed to microbes that wild-living mice constantly encounter. Several studies have highlighted that exposure to microbes and pathogens, including mites and pinworms, and the presence of the wild mouse microbiota may improve the translational value of murine models and better reflect human immune responses [4–8]. However, introduction of murine pathogens to research poses significant challenges for laboratory animal facilities and is often prohibitive because such pathogens are notoriously difficult to contain [9]. Rosshartet al. have defined the wild mouse gut microbiota, which was significantly more diverse and various species were differentially represented as compared to conventional laboratory mice [4]. Reconstitution of germ-free laboratory mice with the wild-mouse gut microbiota enabled their offspring, termed “WildR” by vertical transfer, to experience microbiota-mediated effects before and after birth [10,11]. The gut microbiota of WildR mice was stable over several generations, promoted host fitness and improved disease resistance to influenza virus infection and mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis [4]. A recent study showed that previous intestinal infections in WildR mice increase the gut microbiota’s resistance to subsequent infections by inhibiting pathogen respiration [12]. Taken altogether, WildR mice have demonstrated translational value in several research fields owing to their wild mouse gut microbiota.The onset and recurrence of active TB infection in humans are characterized by a decline in the diversity of the gut microbiota [13,14]. Similarly, mice experience a rapid loss of fecal microbiota diversity upon Mtb infection [15]. Depletion of the microbiome by broad-spectrum antibiotics rendered mice more susceptible to TB and restoring the gut microbiota by fecal transfer reduced the bacterial load of Mtb [16]. Chemotherapy with first-line antimycobacterials led to dysbiosis that persisted beyond the end of drug treatment for at least 3 months in Mtb-infected mice and at least 1.2 years in TB patients [17,18]. Taken altogether, the crosstalk through the gut-lung axis is bidirectional and impacts both Mtb in the lung and the microbial community of the gut. Because there are striking differences between the microbiota of laboratory mice and wild-living mice, we examine whether laboratory mice reconstituted with the wild-mouse gut microbiome may better resemble the hallmarks of clinical TB than conventional laboratory mice. We chose the BALB/c mouse as the host organism for our studies as this strain is widely used in TB preclinical development. Here we investigate the impact of the wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB infection in the BALB/c model using organ bacterial burden, lung histopathology, microbiome changes, cytokine profiles, and T cell responses as readouts."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment.\nResults\nSamples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example,\nCorynebacterium\nand\nPropionibacterium\n(Actinobacteria) but not\nStaphylococcus\n(Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-015-0116-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nKeywords:\nInternational Space Station, Air, Surface, Microbiome, Closed habitat, Cleanroom, Propidium monoazide",

The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat.\nResults\nSuccession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time.

The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.\nSubject terms:\nMicrobiome, Biofilms",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionTechnological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6.Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11.The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example,Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, andRhizobialesrecovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40.Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observedBurkholderiaspecies subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth."

KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF;\nn\n= 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU;\nn\n= 388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (\nn\n= 192, 123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with four (\nAcinetobacter lwoffii\n,\nParacoccus marcusii\n,\nMycobacterium\nsp., and\nNovosphingobium\n) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant,\nA. lwoffii\n, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq protocol.\nIMPORTANCE\nVarious indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months.\nMethods\nEight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.\nResults\nStaphylococcus\nsp. and\nMalassezia\nsp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10\n5\ncfu/m\n2\nConclusions\nUtilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe microbiome of the built environment has been increasingly linked to human health and disease. The composition of built environments is largely influenced by its occupants [1–4] but can also be affected by external features such as seasonal variations [5,6], architectural design [7], and level of urbanization [8]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health.For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [9]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [10]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [11–13]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [14]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [15,16].Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [17]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [18–20], surfaces [21,22], and water [23]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [24] and pathogens [25] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members.The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [26] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionFilamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo (Pierson, 2001;Novikova et al., 2006;Van Houdt et al., 2012). Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system (Pierson, 2001;Sonnenfeld et al., 2003). Additionally, several studies have indicated that spacecraft environments increase microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance (Tixador et al., 1985;Wilson et al., 2007,2008). As we make strides toward human interplanetary exploration, investigations into the characteristics of filamentous fungi that reside in spacecraft environments are critical for crew health. Additionally, such studies present diverse industrial and therapeutic opportunities, as fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to external stressors. These small molecules often kill or inhibit growth of other organisms, enabling fungi to successfully compete within the complex ecosystem they reside in. While some SMs are toxic to humans, others have diverse industrial and therapeutic applications, including antibiotic, anticancer, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and cholesterol-lowering activities (Newman and Cragg, 2012). The remarkable structural and functional diversity of fungal SMs arise from the combinatorial and modular nature of their biosynthesis, in which the SM core backbone is biosynthesized by a core synthase enzyme, such as a polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), or a hybrid PKS-NRPS, and further diversified by a number of tailoring enzymes that are clustered together within the genome (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006).In order to understand the characteristics of microbes residing in the International Space Station (ISS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has implemented a robust microbial monitoring system (Pierson et al., 2013). The filamentous fungusAspergillus nigerhas been reported to be a predominant ISS isolate (Checinska et al., 2015), and is frequently detected in other built environments (Haleem Khan and Mohan Karuppayil, 2012;Varga et al., 2014).A. nigeris a melanized fungal species commonly used in the biotech industry as a production host for citric acid and enzymes (Schuster et al., 2002). Melanized fungi are commonly isolated from highly irradiated environments (Singaravelan et al., 2008;Selbmann et al., 2015), and it has been reported that the electronic properties of melanin change following exposure to ionizing radiation (Dadachova et al., 2007). Additionally, several studies have reported the association of melanin production with fungal virulence (Kwon-Chung et al., 1982;Wang et al., 1995;Nosanchuk et al., 1998). Together, these findings demonstrate the need for studies that assess the characteristics of melanized fungi inhabiting spacecraft environments.Naphtho-γ-pyrones are the predominant class of SMs produced byA. niger, and they possess a diverse array of reported biological properties, including anti-HIV, anti-hyperuricemia, anti-tubercular, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant activities (Choque et al., 2015). Advances in genome sequencing ofA. nigerhave revealed its capacity to produce many other SMs in addition to the naphtho-γ-pyrones, as its genome harbors 46 PKSs, 35 NRPSs, and 9 NRPS-PKS hybrid genes (Romsdahl and Wang, 2019). Many of these SM biosynthesis genes are silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions, which has resulted in a lack of studies on SMs that may have useful industrial and therapeutic properties. Given that fungi produce SMs in response to environmental stress, investigations into SM production ofA. nigerstrains isolated from space environments may reveal enhanced production levels of bioactive molecules and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such adaptations.Here, we report the SM production of JSC-093350089, a previously described strain ofA. nigerisolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Our analysis revealed that the ISS isolate produces high levels of the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), along with other bioactive SMs, such as kotanin, pestalamide B, and naphtho-γ-pyrones, when compared to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. To investigate differences between the strains that may explain the increased production of some SMs in JSC-093350089, we conducted a comparative genetic analysis of biosynthesis clusters and regulators of differentially produced SMs. Finally, the UV resistance potential of pyranonigrin A was assessed."

Comparative genomic analyses of all eight\nE. bungandensis\nstrains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in\nEscherichia coli\nK12, was also observed in the ISS strains.\nConclusion\nGiven the MDR results for these ISS\nEnterobacter\ngenomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions.

To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.\nResults\nThe cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10\n4\nto 10\n9\nCFU/m\n2\ndepending on location and consisted of various bacterial (\nActinobacteria\n,\nFirmicutes\n, and\nProteobacteria\n) and fungal (\nAscomycota\nand\nBasidiomycota\n) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.\nConclusions\nThe results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human space platform in low Earth orbit (~ 400 km above Earth’s surface) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, subjected to microgravity, radiation, elevated carbon dioxide, and the recirculation of air through HEPA filters and is considered an “extreme environment” [1,2]. Microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the ISS may have existed since the inception of the ISS while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive.Since the beginning of the ISS, routine microbial monitoring of surfaces, air, and water has occurred using culture-based techniques as per the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) operations and maintenance requirement procedures [3]. However, culture-based analysis limits our understanding of the diversity of microbes that grow and thrive on the ISS because only a small fraction of organisms in a given environment can be cultured under standard laboratory conditions [4]. Molecular methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted amplicon sequencing, which can identify and quantify both culturable and unculturable organisms provide a more thorough assessment of what is actually present and in what amounts [5]. However, while it has been recently shown as a proof of concept that PCR [6] and amplicon sequencing can be performed on the ISS [7,8], microbial monitoring of the ISS with molecular-based methods is not routinely used because of the lack of simple, compact, and reliable sample processing instruments onboard the ISS. Once such devices are available, rapid, real-time microbial detection, functional analysis are possible for the long duration missions, but baseline information about the ISS environmental microbiome is still needed.The importance of cataloging the ISS microbiome, which consists of both culturable and unculturable microbes, parallels the surge in research into the “built microbiome” here on Earth. Emerging studies on the microbiome of homes [9–11], offices, classrooms, museums [12,13], and hospitals [5,14,15] have revealed an assemblage of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa unique to that indoor environment that are influenced by a variety of factors such as building design, ventilation, humidity, air pressure and flow, occupant numbers, or activities performed [16,17]. Specific microbes in these indoor spaces have been shown to impact human health by influencing our susceptibility to allergies, infectious diseases, or sick building syndrome [18]. The influence of the indoor microbiome on human health becomes more important for astronauts during flights due to altered immunity associated with space flight [19,20] and the lack of sophisticated medical interventions that are available on Earth.In light of an upcoming new era of human expansion in the universe, such as future space travel to Mars, the microbiome of the closed space environment needs to be examined thoroughly to identify the types of microorganisms that can accumulate in this unique environment, how long they persist and survive, and their impact on human health and spacecraft infrastructure. For this reason, the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended that NASA establish a coordinated, large-scale Microbial Observatory program within the ISS platform [21]. As part of this NASA initiative, the microbial communities on ISS surfaces from eight defined locations over three flight missions, spanning 14 months, were characterized using culture-based techniques, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps [22]. Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate into cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) [22,23]. It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells [2,24–26].This comprehensive analysis of the ISS microbiome was used to assess how microbial communities change over time (temporal distribution) and throughout the ISS (spatial distribution). In addition, the ISS environmental microbiome data were compared with other Earth built environmental microbiome data such as the Earth Microbiome Project [27], Hospital ([28], Qiita study 10,172), and Office microbiome ([28], Qiita study 10,423). The implementation of novel molecular techniques to monitor intact microbial populations in this unique environment opens a possibility for broadening the current surveillance practices to maintain the health of the crew and to promote advances in deep space human habitation in the future."

Bacteria, fungi, and archaea have been shown to thrive in habitats characterized by low nutrient availability (Onofri et al., 2004), desiccation (Barnard et al., 2013), high and low temperatures (McKay et al., 2003;Onofri et al., 2007), acidic and alkaline pH (Gonzalez-Toril et al., 2003;Gonsalves, 2012), or radiation (Zhdanova et al., 2004;Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008;Fendrihan et al., 2009;Stan-Lotter and Fendrihan, 2013). There is a need for studies that focus on elucidating microbial survival mechanisms in extreme habitats, as a primary goal of the planetary protection policy is to prevent forward and backward contamination of any celestial bodies and the Earth (Rummel et al., 2002). So far, the majority of such studies have focused on investigating extremophilic bacteria, mainly spore-formers (Nicholson et al., 2012;Tirumalai et al., 2013), and rocks containing fungi (Onofri et al., 2012;Zakharova et al., 2014) however, monolayers of fungal conidia have not been studied.One investigation revealed that the survival of spacecraft-associated bacteria under simulated Mars UV irradiation, is strain-specific and depends on the isolation site (Newcombe et al., 2005). Spacecraft-associated bacteria were more resistant thanBacillus subtillis168, used as a dosimetric control (Newcombe et al., 2005). Additionally, exposure ofB. subtilis168 spores to dark space conditions (no UV) outside the International Space Station (ISS) and SMC for 559 days induced the expression of genes involved in DNA and protein damage responses, and oxidative and envelope stress (Nicholson et al., 2012). Further, the first-generation of spores of another bacterium,Bacillus pumillusSAFR-032, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) was more UV-C resistant than the ground control counterparts following exposure to space UV conditions for 18 months. Extensive studies into the whole genome of SAFR-032 revealed the presence of several DNA repair-associated genes that may have facilitated its survival and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Further, proteome analysis showed that stress response proteins, like superoxide dismutase, were increased in abundance when compared to the control (Vaishampayan et al., 2012).Fungi produce conidia or spores as part of their life cycle. Some of these structures can be more resistant to environmental impact than the typical fungal coenocytic cell. Therefore, molecular characterization and further understanding of fungal resistance to UV-C and SMC are of high importance. Additionally, fungi possess a wide variety of mechanisms to protect against solar radiation, which include enzymes removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation (PR), and the production of pigments such as melanins and melanin-like compounds, and UV-absorbing metabolites that act as sunscreens (Braga et al., 2015). The hardy nature, adaptability and plasticity of fungi enable their persistence in extreme conditions, making them potential contaminants of cleanrooms and, therefore, a forward contamination source.On April 25, 1986 one of the most significant nuclear accidents in history took place. Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) exploded and high levels of released radioactivity turned the surrounding area into a hostile environment. Within the following 18 years over 2,000 fungal isolates were collected from the nuclear power plant, its 30-km Exclusion Zone and beyond, representing some 200 species in over 90 genera (Zhdanova et al., 2004). The observed fungal communities were of low complexity and dominated by melanin-containing strains. Approximately 20% of the isolates displayed a previously unknown phenomenon of growing toward the radiation source referred to as positive radiotropism (Zhdanova et al., 2004;Dighton et al., 2008). Therefore, this unique characteristic of Chernobyl fungi makes them an ideal fungal model for studying adaptation to SMC. Further, the fungal species isolated from Chernobyl have also been detected in built environments, including JPL clean rooms (La Duc et al., 2012;Weinmaier et al., 2015), simulated closed habitats (Blachowicz et al., 2017), and on board of the ISS (Checinska et al., 2015), which further emphasizes the need to study their potential for forward contamination.The ISS is another type of environment that may be considered hostile for microorganisms, featuring constant temperature and humidity, controlled airflow, enhanced irradiation, and microgravity (Mora et al., 2016). Several reports examining microbial burden aboard the ISS have shown that fungal populations thrive in this environment (Checinska et al., 2015;Be et al., 2017). Other studies have investigated molecular adaptations of selected species to space conditions, revealing changes in metabolome, and proteome of ISS-isolated strains (Knox et al., 2016;Romsdahl et al., 2018;Blachowicz et al., 2019). In other investigations, several multilayered or embedded cryptoendolithic fungal communities were exposed to space conditions (Billi et al., 2011;Onofri et al., 2012,2015;Scalzi et al., 2012;Pacelli et al., 2018). Tested isolates that adapted to environmental extremes of their habitats survived SMC for extended periods and revealed high stability of the DNA in the surviving cells (Billi et al., 2011;Onofri et al., 2015;Pacelli et al., 2018). Despite these studies, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate survival of filamentous fungi under SMC and their potential to adapt and survive in outer space.This is the first report that evaluated the survival of Chernobyl-associated and ISS-isolated fungal conidia exposed in monolayers to SMC. Dried monolayers of conidia of four filamentous fungi were exposed to SMC and two strains,Aspergillus fumigatusandCladosporium cladosporoides, which survived exposure to SMC for 30 min, were further analyzed for phenotypic, proteomic and metabolomic changes."

        "Title": "MetaMiner: A Scalable Peptidogenomics Approach for Discovery of Ribosomal Peptide Natural Products with Blind Modifications from Microbial Communities",
        "Abstract": "Graphical Abstract",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionNatural products are back at the center of attention as pharmaceutical leads, as exemplified by the recent discoveries of bioactive natural product drugs (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009;Harvey et al., 2015;Li and Vederas, 2009;Ling et al., 2015). Recent advances in metagenomics are transforming the field of natural product discovery by enabling the recovery of microbial genomes directly from the environmental samples. This has revolutionized our understanding about the microbial composition of various communities and their biosynthetic gene clusters. Biosynthetic gene cluster are sets of genes that synthesize microbial small molecules from simple building blocks. The metagenomes of microbial communities contain thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with unknown small molecule products, making them an untapped resource for the future antimicrobial drug discovery (Charlop-Powers et al., 2016;Donia et al., 2014;Hadjithomas et al., 2015).The biosynthetic gene clusters of natural products in microbial genomes can be identified by sequence similarity searches (Li et al., 2009). Moreover, in the case of peptide natural products (PNPs), it is possible to predict the corresponding putative structures based on the genes present in their biosynthetic gene clusters (Oman and van der Donk, 2010; Stachelhaus et al., 1999). However, the structure of PNPs usually differs from these predictions due to post-translational modifications applied by the enzymes in the biosynthetic gene cluster. For example, in the case of polytheonamides, the PNP has 49 residues, with 21 post-translational modifications, making it nearly impossible to predict the PNP structure solely based on the genomic data. Therefore, in addition to genome mining, metabolomics methods including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance are routinely used for determining the structure of the molecular product of biosynthetic gene cluster (Doroghazi et al., 2014;Medema et al., 2014;Mohimani et al., 2014a;Mohimani et al., 2014b).The recent launch of the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure (Wang et al., 2016) brought together over a thousand laboratories worldwide that have already generated an unprecedented amount of tandem mass spectra of natural products. Computational mass spectrometry methods have revealed thousands of known small molecules and their unknown variants in various microbiome datasets from the GNPS molecular networking (Gurevich et al., 2018;Mohimani et al., 2017;Mohimani et al., 2018). However, the majority of the spectra in these datasets remains unannotated, which is often referred as the ‘dark matter of metabolomics’. A portion of these spectra represent unknown small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters encoded in the microbial genomes, and computational algorithms are needed for illuminating this dark matter (Donia and Fischbach, 2015;Medema and Fischbach, 2015;Mohimani and Pevzner, 2016;Vaniya and Fiehn, 2015;Walsh, 2015).This paper focuses on the integration of computational mass spectrometry and genome mining for discovering unknown Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs). RiPPs are a rapidly expanding group of natural products with applications in pharmaceutical and food industries (Arnison et al., 2013). RiPPs are produced through the Post Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis (PRPS) pathway (Arnison et al., 2013). Initially, RiPPs are synthesized as precursor peptides encoded by RiPP structural genes. The RiPP structural genes are often short, making their annotations difficult (Mohimani et al., 2014a). The precursor peptide consists of a prefix leader peptide appended to a suffix core peptide. The leader peptide is important for the recognition by the RiPP post-translational modification enzymes and for exporting the RiPP out of the cell. The core peptide is post-translationally modified by the RiPP biosynthetic machinery, proteolytically cleaved from the leader peptide to yield the mature RiPP, and exported out of the cell by transporters. The precursor peptide and the enzymes responsible for its post-translational modifications (PTMs), proteolytic cleavage, and transportation are usually located within a contiguous biosynthetic gene cluster of the RiPP. The length of a microbial RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster typically varies from 1,000 to 40,000 bp (average length 10,000 bp). Since RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters are much longer than the current length of short reads generated by next generation sequencing, DNA assembly is a critical part of any RiPP discovery approach based on short reads.Genome mining refers to the interpretation of a natural product biosynthetic gene cluster to infer information about the natural product itself. The discoveries of coelichelin inStreptomyces coelicolor(Challis and Ravel, 2000;Lautru et al., 2005) and orfamide inPseudomonas fluorescensPf-5 (Gross et al., 2007;Paulsen et al., 2005) were the first examples of genome mining that were followed by discoveries of various bioactive RiPPs in microbial samples. Donia et al. discovered lactocillin, a thiopeptide antibiotic from the human vaginal isolates that showed activity against vaginal pathogens (Donia et al., 2014). Zhao et al. discovered eight novel lanthipeptides with antibiotic activity from a ruminant bacterium (Zhao and van der Donk, 2016). Freeman et al. and Wilson et al. used metagenome mining of a sponge to assign a biosynthetic gene cluster to the known RiPP polytheonamide, with post-translational modifications distributed across 49 residues (Freeman et al., 2012;Wilson et al., 2014). Thus, large-scale metagenomics projects, such as Earth Microbiome Project (Gilbert et al., 2014;Thompson et al., 2017), American Gut Project (McDonald et al., 2018), and Human Microbiome Project (Human Microbiome Project, 2012a,b;Lloyd-Price et al., 2017), have the potential to contribute to RiPP discovery, provided that improved bioinformatics tools for the enhanced identification of novel RiPPs are available. However, discovery of lactocillin and other recently identified RiPPs were not achieved by an automated process, but rather used time-consuming manual analysis that required the isolation of microbes, and the purification of microbial metabolites. Our goal is to discover the RiPPs directly from the mass spectrometry and metagenomics information using a fully automated approach.While recent analysis of thousands of bacterial and fungal genomes has already resulted in the discovery of many putative biosynthetic gene clusters, including 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in the Integrated Microbial Genome Atlas of biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC), connecting these biosynthetic gene clusters to their metabolites has not kept pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing (Hadjithomas et al., 2015). Currently, only 35 out of these roughly 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in IMG-ABC have been experimentally connected to their RiPPs (Hadjithomas et al., 2015;Medema et al., 2015). Linking RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters to unknown RiPPs requires the development of computational tools.Kersten et al. introduced the peptidogenomics approach to RiPP discovery, which refers to finding sequential amino acid tags from the tandem mass spectra (peptidomics) and mining them in the assembled DNA reads obtained from the same sample (Kersten et al., 2011). Mohimani et al. introduced RiPPquest, the first automated approach to RiPP discovery by combining mass spectrometry and genome mining (Mohimani et al., 2014a). This tool is based onPeptide-Spectrum Matches, which are generated by aligning predicted spectra of putative RiPPs annotated by genome mining. If apeptide-spectrum matchbetween a candidate RiPP predicted from the assembled genome and a spectrum is statistically significant, then RiPPquest reports it as a putative annotation of the spectrum. RiPPquest resulted in the identification of the lanthipeptide ‘informatipeptin’, the first natural product discovered in a fully automatic fashion by a computer. However, RiPPquest has a number of limitations: (a) it is limited to lanthipeptides which constitutes only one of 19 classes of RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013), (b) it is designed for small genomes and small spectral datasets, making it rather slow in the case of large metagenomic datasets and the entire GNPS infrastructure, (c) it does not report the statistical significance of the identified RiPPs, a key requirement for any high-throughput peptide identification tool, and (d) it is limited to searches for a predefined set of post-translational modification (PTMs) and does not enable blind searches for unknown PTMs. Since RiPPquest, other tools have been developed that combine genomics with mass spectrometry based discovery (Medema et al., 2014;Skinnider et al., 2015). However, these tools are limited to the analysis of a single or few spectra from isolated genomes and cannot scale to search billions of spectra from GNPS against metagenomics datasets.This paper describes MetaMiner, a tool that enables searching mass spectrometry databases against metagenomics short reads sequenced from microbiome samples for rapid discovery of RiPPs. Application of MetaMiner to mass spectrometry and metagenomics data from the human microbiome resulted in the identification of known and unknown peptides from the human microbiota, including autoinducer peptide (AIP), Mec-PSM, delta-toxin, and their unknown variants."

        "Title": "Assessing the risk of transfer of microorganisms at the International Space Station due to cargo delivery by commercial resupply vehicles",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nWith increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions.\nResults\nSamples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of\nActinobacteria\n,\nProteobacteria\n,\nFirmicutes\n, and\nBacteroidetes\nand members of\nAscomycota\nand\nBasidiomycota\n. As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g.,\nBacillus firmus\n) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome.\nConclusions\nThe metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.\nKeywords:\nforward contamination, microbial diversity, commercial resupply vehicle, viability, International Space Station",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionSpacefaring nations carrying out interplanetary missions are subject to rules and regulations that were designed and instigated by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1967 (COSPAR, 2011). Protocols for cleaning and sterilization are of the highest priority and are regularly practiced and meticulously followed during spacecraft assembly for various missions (Benardini et al., 2014). Cleanrooms are where various spacecraft subsystems, including commercial resupply vehicles (CRV) transporting cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), are assembled. These cleanrooms undergo daily cleaning procedures, including vacuuming and mopping of floors with 70% Isopropanol, high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) air filtration, regular replacement of sticky mats at the entrance, and strict gowning procedures. Utmost care is taken by personal entering these facilities, as they are required to put on face masks, gloves, bodysuits, shoe covers, cleanroom boots, and cover hair and beards with nets (Benardini et al., 2014). These precautionary measures are a part of routine exercises, because humans are the primary source of microbial contamination (Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2015;Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019;Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). On average, humans shed 1.5 million skin cells an hour which carry approximately 15 million bacterial cells, thus becoming a significant source of the indoor microbiome (Jaffal et al., 1997;Lax et al., 2014). Many reports showed transfer of microorganisms via direct contact to indoor surfaces like keyboards (Fierer et al., 2010), restrooms (Flores et al., 2011), offices (Hewitt et al., 2012), kitchens (Flores et al., 2013), airplanes (McManus and Kelley, 2005;Korves et al., 2013), and hospitals (Kembel et al., 2012;Lax et al., 2017). Because of the human presence in these cleanrooms, their surfaces are not expected to be free of microbial burden.The ISS and CRV assembly cleanrooms, including spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) environments, are strictly controlled and monitored for airflow, water circulation, temperature, and humidity; however, individual differences do exist between the two systems (Checinska et al., 2015). The ISS is a closed system where the air is recirculated after purification, while cleanrooms get a constant supply of fresh air from the outside environment. Additionally, astronauts live and work on the ISS as humans do in a typical household on Earth, while SAF cleanrooms have strict requirements that avoid activities like eating or sleeping. At a given point in time, the ISS harbors around six astronauts with a maximum of around 13 crew, while approximately 50 people can work in a cleanroom every day in a highly regulated manner. Despite high human traffic in SAF, the microbial burden was minimal and ranged between 102and 104cells per m2(Hendrickson et al., 2017). It has also been shown that the cleaning procedures followed at SAF significantly decreased the number of microorganisms, but these procedures led to the selection of hardy, robust microorganisms capable of surviving extreme oligotrophic conditions (Gioia et al., 2007;Vaishampayan et al., 2012;Mahnert et al., 2015). Cargos such as food and equipment for scientific experiments are assembled in clean conditions and delivered to the ISS via CRV. All spacefaring nations impose cleanroom requirements when packaging their cargos that are resupplying the ISS.The objective of this study is to decipher the role of CRV systems in potentially transporting microorganisms to the ISS to understand if CRV could be a source of microbial contamination of the ISS. Sampling of various surfaces of CRV systems (CRV1, CRV2, and CRV3) was carried out prior to launch (∼1 month) and corresponding in-flight sampling of the ISS (Flight 1, Flight 2, and Flight 3) was designed to be within 25–51 days after docking of the respective CRV systems (seeFigure 1for a timeline). This sampling scheme was implemented to help understand whether CRV1 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 1, whether CRV2 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 2, or whether CRV3 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 3. Microbial burden associated with CRV environmental surface samples were estimated using traditional techniques (e.g., colony counts), and molecular techniques like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay and 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (fungi) quantification using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. In addition to characterizing cultivable microbial diversity using the Sanger sequencing method, the CRV samples were more thoroughly analyzed using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. Subsequently, the microbial diversity of the CRV samples was compared with the ISS environmental microbiome (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019) to understand the potential transfer of biological materials from Earth to the ISS.FIGURE 1.Open in a new tab(A)Sampling time line for the CRV and the ISS samples.

        "Title": "Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., isolated from the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nFour strains belonging to the family of\nMethylobacteriaceae\nwere isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2\nT\n, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as\nMethylorubrum rhodesianum\n. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2\nT\n, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for\ngyrB\ngene, with the closest being\nMethylobacterium indicum\nSE2.11\nT\n. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of\nM. indicum.\nThe average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described\nMethylobacterium\nspecies. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus\nMethylobacterium.\nThe three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble\nM. aquaticum\nand\nM. terrae\nsince they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other\nMethylobacterium\nspecies. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C\n18\n:\n1\n−ω7\nc\nand C\n18\n:\n1\n−ω6\nc\n. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2\nT\n, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus\nMethylobacterium\n, and the name\nMethylobacterium ajmalii\nsp. nov. is proposed.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe genusMethylobacteriumcontains more species than any other genera within the familyMethylobacteriaceae, orderRhizobiales, and classAlphaproteobacteria(Kelly et al., 2014).Methylobacteriumspecies are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The genus was first proposed byPatt et al. (1976)withMethylobacterium organophilumas the type species. The genusMethylobacteriumwas first emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (Patt et al., 1976). Another taxonomic study classified all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genusMethylobacterium(Green and Bousfield, 1982). Thereafter, 11 species from the genusMethylobacteriumwere redefined into a new genus proposed asMethylorubrum, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (Green and Ardley, 2018).The genusMethylobacteriumconsists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (Gallego et al.,2005a,b;Kang et al., 2007;Veyisoglu et al., 2013;Kelly et al., 2014;Kwak et al., 2014;Chaudhry et al., 2016;Green and Ardley, 2018;Park et al., 2018).Methylobacteriumspecies are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (Madhaiyan et al., 2006;Kumar M. et al., 2016;Parasuraman et al., 2019;Grossi et al., 2020;Krug et al., 2020). For instance, a novelMethylobacteriumsp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (Grossi et al., 2020). Furthermore, genomic analysis ofMethylobacteriumsp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (Grossi et al., 2020).In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceaewere isolated (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Some of theMethylobacteriumspecies that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (Kang et al., 2007;Chaudhry et al., 2016), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and define the phylogenetic novelty of the ISSMethylobacteriumstrains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMost natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.\nKeywords:\nclimate change, evolutionary processes, genetic diversity, host–parasite interactions, MHC",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionWe are facing a severe biodiversity crisis attributable to human activities (Allentoft and O'Brien2010). Habitat loss and climate change are leading to population declines, loss of genetic diversity and increased extinction risk. Genetic diversity is considered one of the vital pillars of biodiversity and is essential for the capacity of a population to adapt to new environments (Alberto et al.2013; Frankham2010; Pauls et al.2013). The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have garnered wide interest for their role in parasite recognition and immune defense at the individual and population level (Sommer2005). The MHC is typically highly polymorphic, but genetic erosion of the MHC may severely compromise a population's capacity to adapt to changing parasitic environments or the emergence of novel parasites.In this review, we summarize the key features of the MHC and discuss the dynamics influencing MHC diversity across spatial and temporal scales. We also explore these dynamics in the context of future climate change. Finally, we present how to integrate immunogenetic, environmental, and parasite data across taxa to test hypotheses and uncover the spatial and temporal patterns. Understanding overarching geographical and long‐term temporal patterns has exceptional merit for conservation biology, informing appropriate actions to limit parasite spread within and across populations (Ekroth et al.2021; Langwig et al.2015; Smith et al.2009).1.1. \nMHC Diversity and the Processes Maintaining VariationMHC is a multi‐gene family found in all jawed vertebrates, which is considered the most variable set of genes in the genome (Hood et al.1983; Hughes2002; Kaufman et al.1985; Klein1975; Rock et al.2016). The MHC plays a crucial role in parasite recognition and activation of the immune response. Each MHC class I and II protein binds to a specific set of peptides, with distinct MHC proteins recognizing and interacting with different antigenic peptides (Kaufman et al.1985). The high genetic diversity in the MHC region is concentrated in the domains that encode antigen‐binding sites of the classical MHC class I and class II molecules (Klein1975). MHC class I is predominately expressed on nucleated cells and is involved in the surveillance of intracellular parasites, such as viruses. MHC class II is expressed on specialized immune cells, such as B‐cells and dendritic cells, and is thus involved in the surveillance of extracellular parasites, such as bacteria and macro‐parasites (Klein1979). The high variation in MHC molecules is directly linked to their ability to bind a wide array of antigens from various pathogens—viruses, bacteria, and macro‐parasites—thereby enhancing recognition by the host immune system (Kaufman et al.1985). MHC diversity is further amplified by copy number variation within species, such that multiple gene copies can be found across individuals (Minias2024). This variation expands the repertoire of antigen presentation and parasite recognition of individuals (Bentkowski and Radwan2019). It also creates a challenge, however, to accurately characterize MHC diversity by for example, amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing by short‐read sequencing technologies, as sequences cannot be assigned to specific MHC loci (Babik2010; Lighten et al.2014; Peel et al.2022). Many studies on MHC diversity focus on the specific exon or exons involved in peptide binding and analyze MHC genotypes, supertypes, or heterozygosity in the context of for example, molecular evolution, population genetics, conservation biology, disease associations, and mate choice (reviewed in Cheng et al.2022). MHC diversity in the context of infection resistance has been studied in amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals (Kosch et al.2022; Nash and Ryan2023; Savage and Zamudio2011; Schmid et al.2023; Vinkler et al.2022).Host parasite resistance and fitness are closely related to the variability of MHC molecules (Vinkler et al.2022). Sedge warblers (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) with many MHC class I supertypes have higher resistance to avian malaria (Biedrzycka and Radwan2008). Associations between specific MHC alleles and avian malaria prevalence have also been reported in other Passeriformes (Bonneaud et al.2006; Westerdahl et al.2005). In amphibians, specific MHC class II exon 2 haplotypes in common toads (Bufo bufo) are associated with individual survival rates to infection by the deadly chytrid fungus,Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The survival of infected toads was dependent on MHC haplotype configuration (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al.2022). Across multiple amphibian species, resistance to chytrid fungus has been linked to the MHC class II pocket‐9 conformation, based on experimental infections and field observations of chytrid‐associated population declines (Bataille et al.2015).Parasite‐mediated balancing selection is the main evolutionary pressure maintaining genetic variation at the MHC across populations and between species, with the latter being referred to as trans‐species polymorphism (Charlesworth2006; Hedrick1998; Höglund2009; Sommer2005). Evidence of parasite‐mediated balancing selection has been found across host taxa, including amphibians (Trujillo et al.2021), birds (He et al.2021; Minias et al.2021), fish (Herdegen‐Radwan et al.2021), and mammals (Ebert and Fields2020; Gonzalez2021; Zhang et al.2018).There are three non‐mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining the parasite‐mediated maintenance of MHC polymorphism, namely ‘Heterozygosity Advantage’, ‘Rare Allele Advantage’ (negative frequency‐dependent selection) and ‘Fluctuating Selection’ across landscapes or time (Gibson2022; Spurgin and Richardson2010). The ‘Heterozygosity Advantage’ hypothesis posits that heterozygous individuals can recognize a larger variety of antigens than homozygous individuals, conferring greater resistance to infection in the former (Lo et al.2021; Savage et al.2011). Additionally, individuals with more divergent MHC alleles have been hypothesized to bind and recognize a wider array of antigens, further increasing parasite resistance (Divergent Allele Advantage) (Lau et al.2015; Lenz et al.2009; Wakeland et al.1990). The ‘Rare Allele Advantage’ hypothesis predicts that a rare or novel allele in a population will confer greater disease resistance, as there is strong selection on parasites from common MHC alleles to overcome resistance (also Bolnick and Stutz2017; Bourgeois et al.2021; Takahata and Nei1990). For example, Trinidadian guppies carrying novel MHC alleles and MHC supertypes experience a 37% reduction in infection intensity of the ectoparasite,Gyrodactylus turnbulli(Phillips et al.2018). Rare allele advantage may also favor old, rare alleles, resulting in a cyclical, co‐evolutionary dynamic in which MHC alleles fluctuate in frequency over time, maintaining diversity (Slade1992). Finally, the ‘Fluctuating Selection’ hypothesis states that spatial and temporal variation in parasite prevalence, diversity and infection intensity generates a heterogenous selective environment, leading to different MHC alleles being favored at different times and/or different places. Overall, this heterogeneity will maintain MHC diversity in host meta‐populations (Hedrick2002; Spurgin and Richardson2010). Parasite‐mediated selection under ‘Fluctuating Selection’ on the MHC is thus directional, but also variable due to changes in biotic or abiotic environment, as well as chance dispersal and extinction events. Determining the relative roles of these modes of selection is a challenge, as they are not mutually exclusive. All three modes may act to shape overall MHC diversity (Spurgin and Richardson2010). For example, a role for fluctuating selection has been reported in several species (Osborne et al.2017; Teacher et al.2009; Trujillo et al.2021), and occasionally in combination with either divergent allele advantage (Osborne et al.2017) or negative frequency‐dependent selection (Teacher et al.2009; Trujillo et al.2021). Additionally, geographical variation in modes of selection has been observed, for example in moor frogs (Rana arvalis). In this species, MHC class II variation was found to decrease in northern populations due to directional selection, and variation was maintained at southern latitudes due to divergent and/or balancing selection (Cortazar‐Chinarro et al.2018).MHC diversity can also be shaped by other selective and neutral forces (Wakelin and Apanius1997). Genetic drift resulting from demographic processes (i.e., post‐glacial recolonization, migration) impacts genetic variation genome‐wide, and has been shown to affect MHC diversity in fragmented and small populations, or at the edge of species distributions (Belasen et al.2022,2019; Herdegen et al.2014; Höglund et al.2022). MHC‐based mate choice (disassortative mating) may also help to maintain MHC diversity in excess of what is expected under parasite‐mediated selection alone (Ejsmond and Radwan2015). It has been argued that the combined effects of natural and sexual selection on MHC variants explain how diverse communities of hosts and parasites can be maintained over evolutionary time. That is, even in the face of strong frequency‐dependent selection favoring particular MHC genotypes (Milinski2006). Models combining the effects of natural selection and MHC‐based disassortative mating in small populations have indicated that while parasite‐mediated selection can accelerate loss of MHC diversity, the stabilizing effects of sexual selection can moderate major fluctuations in allele frequencies and protect functional variants against drift (Jan Ejsmond et al.2014). Appropriately, the interaction between multiple evolutionary forces contributes to shaping and potentially maintaining important genetic variation in at‐risk populations. Critically, understanding how eco‐evolutionary processes (neutral vs. adaptive) shape genetic variation in wildlife populations is a key challenge. Expanding our study systems to encompass spatial and temporal patterns shows potential to help disentangle the evolutionary dynamics underlying these processes."

        "Title": "Effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus Knufia chersonesos.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBlack fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus\nKnufia chersonesos\n(Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between\nK. chersonesos\nWt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, black fungi, extremophiles, secretomics, proteomics, astrobiology,\nKnufia chersonesos\n(syn.\nK. petricola\n)",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionBased on their nature as settlers in extreme environments, microbial extremophiles are of great interest to studies aiming to elucidate stress adaptation and survival mechanisms. Successful examples of extremophiles can be found in the fungal domain, alongside bacteria, and archaea, which for a long time were considered to be the sole colonizers of habitats previously considered uninhabitable. Some of these fungal extremophiles show even higher resistance than that of prokaryotes (Shtarkman et al., 2013;Aguilera and González-Toril, 2019). Black fungi in particular represent a group of highly melanized microfungi, whose ability to survive in a variety of extreme environments has in recent decades attracted increasing attention (Selbmann et al., 2005;Sterflinger, 2006;Gorbushina, 2007;Onofri et al., 2007). Desiccation, low nutrient availability, excessive radiation, extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH are some of the multiple sources of stress characterizing the habitats where these organisms have been shown to thrive (Gunde-Cimerman et al., 2000,2003;Selbmann et al., 2008). The highest diversity of black fungi has especially been observed in rocky environments, ranging from mountain summits to the Atacama Desert and the Antarctic cold regions (Gonçalves et al., 2016;Ametrano et al., 2019). Rock represents a harsh habitat and a quite ancient niche for life, believed to reflect early Earth conditions, and thus considered to be a model for extraterrestrial life (Selbmann et al., 2014).The discovery of melanized fungi in extreme environments has prompted researchers to investigate microbial physiology at the absolute edges of adaptability, aiming at a deeper understanding of the limits for life (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008;Tesei et al., 2012;Zakharova et al., 2013). Other studies have focused on testing fungal survival in space conditions through simulations in ground-based facilities or in space missions that enabled the assessment of the habitability of extraterrestrial environments and, hence, the possibility of life beyond Earth (Scalzi et al., 2012;Onofri et al., 2019). Space and outer space conditions are by definition hostile, as they include enhanced irradiation, microgravity, and temperature extremes (Rabbow et al., 2012,2017;Senatore et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the isolation of melanized fungi from spacecraft and space stations—e.g., the International Space Station (ISS)—has been reported frequently (Checinska et al., 2015;Checinska-Sielaff et al., 2019). In this respect, a number of studies have examined the molecular adaptations of ISS-isolated strains to space conditions, showing alterations in metabolome and proteome (Knox et al., 2016;Blachowicz et al., 2019b;Romsdahl et al., 2019). Investigations of microbial survival in space are therefore relevant also in the context of space missions, to prevent contaminations and to develop strategies to reduce hazard, especially in the case of opportunistic species (Urbaniak et al., 2019).In black fungi, astrobiological studies have evaluated the potential effects of Mars or ISS conditions on fungal viability and metabolism. One investigation revealed that a rock isolate from Antarctica,Cryomyces minteri, could survive simulated Martian atmosphere and pressure, temperature fluctuations between −20 and 20°C, ultraviolet radiation, and vacuum (Onofri et al., 2008). Comparative 2D-PAGE proteomics was carried out for other rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) (i.e.,Cryomyces antarcticus,Knufia perforans, andExophiala jeanselmei) exposed to these conditions and showed a decrease in protein complexity, followed by recovery of the metabolic activity after 1 week of exposure (Zakharova et al., 2014). Further, survivability ofC.antarcticusin outer space was shown via colony counts following a 1.5-year-long exposure on board the EXPOSE-E facility of the ISS (Onofri et al., 2012). A more recent experiment ofC.antarcticusexposure on rock analogs under space and simulated Martian conditions revealed only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage and pointed out the high stability of DNA within melanized cells (Pacelli et al., 2016). In other investigations, the resistance to acute ionizing radiations was demonstrated in RIF (Pacelli et al., 2017,2018). Together, these studies have revealed the ability of rock-colonizing black fungi to endure space conditions; however, to date, reports that specifically evaluate the response to microgravity have not been produced.Microgravity is an important factor influencing microbial life in space environments, a condition in which the gravity level is almost zero but not neutralized. Due to the technological and logistical hurdles linked to studies of microgravity in space, different methods have been developed to simulate microgravity and analyze microbial responses (Herranz et al., 2013). Accordingly, the term low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) is used to describe the environmental condition created by these devices, resembling the low-shear effects of the fluid on the cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2014). Spaceflight and ground-based microgravity analog experiments have suggested that microgravity can affect microbial gene expression, cell morphology, physiology, and metabolism, also triggering increased virulence in pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Altenburg et al., 2008;Taylor, 2015;Sathishkumar et al., 2016;Huang et al., 2018). Although the effects of microgravity on microbes have been studied for several years, only the responses of a few typical prokaryotic and eukaryotic model organisms—e.g.,Escherichia coli,Candida albicans,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp.—have hitherto been investigated (Huang et al., 2018). Hence, studying the reaction of black fungi to microgravity holds potential for the elucidation of the molecular basis of tolerance in extremotolerant and extremophilic fungi, and can also contribute to unearthing the biological uniqueness of these species and their adaptability to space conditions.In the present study, the qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to LSSMG was carried out for the first time. The rock-associatedKnufia chersonesos(syn.Knufia petricola) was selected as the model organism due to its reported poikilo-tolerance, e.g., the ability to endure xeric conditions, desiccation, high UV-radiation and temperatures (Sterflinger et al., 2012) and to feed on alternative carbon sources like monoaromatic compounds (Nai et al., 2013) and synthetic polyesters (Tesei et al., 2020).K. chersonesosaptitude to withstand levels of gaseous ozone up to 11 ppm was also shown (Tesei et al., unpublished). Furthermore, being the only black fungus known to have a melanin-deficient spontaneous mutant (Tesei et al., 2017),K. chersonesosallows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the stress-protective role of melanin. Cultures ofK. chersonesoswild type and mutant were grown in HARVs and analyzed for changes at the proteome—whole-cell proteome (mycelia) and secretome (culture supernatant)—and at the morphological level, with an eye toward the impact of cell-wall melanization on the physiological response to the stress."

The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned missions to the Moon andcis-lunar orbit, it has become evident that growing plants for food and other life support systems is essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4. To ensure that these future missions are successful, it is necessary to investigate all aspects of the basic physiological and molecular responses of food crops and their microbiomes to the spaceflight environment, so that any issues faced on these missions can be efficiently managed and mitigated on-orbit.Plants have complex and dynamic relationships with their microorganisms, which are influenced by various stresses and environmental factors, including spaceflight5–9. The novel environments of spaceflight and microgravity analogs have been shown to alter the plant–microbe interactions at both the genetic and physiological levels, oftentimes resulting in increased susceptibility to diseases10–14. For example, soybean seedlings grown in spaceflight are more susceptible to the colonization of fungal pathogen,Phytophthora sojae, when compared to ground controls10. In addition, simulated microgravity experiments have demonstrated that clinorotation reduces the growth and development of the legumeMedicargo truncatulaand significantly affects its symbiotic relationship with the rhizobiumSinorhizobium melilotiand arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiRhizophagus irregularis15. Specifically, nodule size and number were reduced under clinorotation when compared to static controls15. Moreover, in another simulated microgravity experiment performed on random positioning machines, the endophytic bacterial diversity in wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings behaves differently under simulated microgravity when compared to normal gravity controls14. Specifically, some bacterial genera (e.g.,Pseudomonas,Paenibacillus, andBacillus) that can produce plant growth-promoting and antimicrobial substances, exhibit clear differences in relative abundance between microgravity and Earth gravity treatments14. However, research on how microgravity impacts plant–microbe interactions is still in its infancy. It is, therefore, critical to develop efficient methods for investigating plant–microbe interactions to expand our current knowledge base for future space exploration. The dynamic nature of plant–microbial interactions requires regular monitoring of a crop’s microbiome and its metabolic activities to assess plant health. These measures together with other surveillance techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) will ensure that successful cultivation of crops on long-duration missions in space can be accomplished.To date, plants have been successfully grown in space in multiple hardware systems, such as the Vegetable Production System (Veggie), Advanced Plant Habitat, and the LADA greenhouse16. For example, edible leafy crops have been safely produced in the Veggie hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumed by crew members17. There have been, however, sporadic instances of contamination with opportunistic fungal pathogens. In a Veggie experiment (VEG-01C),Zinnia hybridaplants were infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen,Fusarium oxysporum18,19.F. oxysporumis a ubiquitous group of soilborne fungi that are highly adaptable to different habitats and include non-pathogenic strains, plant pathogens, and even opportunistic human pathogens20. Pathogenic strains ofF. oxysporumcan cause Fusarium wilt in nearly every agriculturally important crop21. Some multi-host isolates in plants also have the potential to cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised mammals22–25. Even though the fungal infection on theZinniaplants was likely due to a malfunction of a fan in the Veggie hardware26, it demonstrated the importance of characterizing the healthy basal microbiome of all plants cultivated in space.To achieve this goal, methodologies are needed to regularly monitor changes in the microbial community during flight to potentially mitigate the rise of pathogenic taxa. Currently, the standard protocol for the investigation of plant–pathogen interactions aboard the ISS is to harvest the plant material, freeze it, and return it to Earth for analysis27. However, with future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit likely taking up to 6 months between resupply missions, it will be critical to develop faster, on-side methodologies to regularly monitor and assess plant–microbe health.Here we present a method for using metatranscriptomics coupled with nanopore sequencing to characterize the plant microbiome and their functional activity from plant–microbe total RNA samples that could be feasibly completed on-orbit. Metatranscriptomics has emerged as an effective methodology to characterize the plant microbiome and evaluate its transcriptional activity28. Transcriptional surveys, among many others, enable the identification and assessment of the main drivers of changes in plant health29–32. However, to date, metatranscriptomic studies of plant microbiomes have all utilized Illumina sequencing platforms, which are not feasible for spaceflight applications due to their large up-mass, weight, and footprint. The pocket-sized, USB-powered nanopore MinION, sequencing platform, which weighs <100 g and is capable of single-molecule sequencing of native full-length DNA and RNA molecules33, has emerged as a viable sequence platform for spaceflight. In 2016, the nanopore-sequencing system was successfully used aboard the ISS for DNA analysis and compared to next-generation sequencing platforms, such as Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII34. Although the nanopore system has been successfully used for DNA applications, its use for metatranscriptomic analyses is only now emerging35–38and has not yet been used to analyze the metatranscriptome of microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA samples.As a proof-of-concept, we have characterized the microbiome of red romaine lettuce grown under a baseline condition (i.e., ISS-like ground controls) using MinION-based metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that plants can be rapidly and effectively screened using this molecular approach. By developing reliable methodologies to regularly monitor and compare changes in the functional activity of the plant microorganisms over time, early detection of opportunistic pathogens can help inform mitigation strategies and provide important insight into agricultural practices aboard spacecraft to maximize crop production and ensure crew safety on long-duration missions."

        "Title": "Investigation of Spaceflight Induced Changes to Astronaut Microbiomes",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.\nKeywords:\nmicrogravity, gut microbiota, metabolic dysfunction, liver, brain, 3D-Clinostat",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe space environment is extremely complex, characterized by strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity, as well as other environmental factors [1,2]. These factors are collectively referred to as space composite stress, which can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [3,4]. Microgravity, in particular, is a significant factor affecting the health of astronauts aboard a spacecraft and has therefore received considerable attention from researchers [5]. This is primarily because weightlessness not only leads to the redistribution of body fluids towards the head but also deprives the human body of gravitational load. Prolonged stays in space can increase the risks of decreased cardiovascular capacity, impaired immune system, reduced bone density, neurological disorders, and muscle atrophy [6,7,8]. When a spacecraft carrying astronauts rotates around the Earth, the interior is theoretically a zero-gravity environment. However, due to the influence of residual atmospheric drag and the spacecraft’s rotation, the interior actually exhibits a microgravity environment [9]. Nevertheless, true space flight experiments are rarely conducted due to their scarcity of opportunities, high costs, and operational complexity. As a result, most research on the effects of microgravity on the human body is conducted through ground-based simulation experiments, with actual flight tests providing supplementary validation [10]. Ground-based simulation studies of microgravity effects can provide referable data and experimental methods for actual space flight experiments. These simulations are crucial for understanding the physiological impacts of microgravity and developing countermeasures to protect astronaut health during space missions.Exploring the role of microgravity in the damage caused by space composite stress has become an important topic in ground-based experiments in recent years [11,12]. Various damages or abnormalities caused by microgravity in the body are collectively referred to as microgravity effects. The microgravity effects are mainly manifested as changes in multiple physiological systems such as the cardiovascular, liver, bone, muscle, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [13,14,15]. In recent years, researchers have conducted studies on multiple physiological systems related to microgravity, either independently or focusing on some of their interactive effects. However, these studies mainly concentrate on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, while there are relatively few studies on the liver–brain system, especially on its mechanisms. The liver, as the largest internal organ involved in detoxification and metabolism to maintain the body’s homeostasis, experiences significant gravitational changes. Comparisons between flight specimens and ground controls have shown that among ten types of mouse tissues including muscle, eyes, and kidneys, the liver has the largest number of differentially expressed genes and proteins [16]. As an important detoxification organ for preventing physical injuries caused by space risks, the liver also has a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs taken during spaceflight [17,18]. In addition, microgravity exposure can lead to liver dysfunction, resulting in liver injuries and inflammation related to apoptosis and oxidative stress, impaired metabolism, changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism, and lipid deposition [14]. Obviously, these dysfunctions are related to changes in liver metabolism or morphological structure caused by microgravity. Specifically, the major pathophysiological steps involved in these processes are summarized as follows: (1) apoptosis and oxidative stress: microgravity can disrupt the intracellular redox balance, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [19,20]. Excessive ROS can attack biomacromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA within liver cells, causing oxidative damage. Microgravity also activates apoptotic signaling pathways in liver cells, such as the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, microgravity induces changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing cytochrome c to be released into the cytoplasm. This activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3, triggering cell apoptosis; (2) inflammatory response: microgravity can induce or exacerbate liver injury by stimulating the release of inflammatory factors and the infiltration of inflammatory cells [21]; (3) metabolic impairment: microgravity affects pathways or enzymes related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein metabolism [22], leading to metabolic abnormalities of glucose, lipids, and proteins; (4) changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism: microgravity can influence the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (such as the CYP450 enzyme system) in the liver, as well as alter the expression levels of drug transporters (such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting polypeptides) [23,24]; and (5) lipid deposition: microgravity disrupts the activity of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism in the liver [25,26], leading to increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased oxidation. Additionally, microgravity affects the expression of genes related to lipoprotein synthesis in the liver, reducing the synthesis and secretion of lipoproteins. Long-term Space Composite Stress in Rats (LSCS) can also trigger depression and cognitive impairments in the body in multiple ways. The possible pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive and poorly understood, involving multiple aspects, including the dysregulation of neural plasticity in astronauts’ brains, decreased levels of neurotransmitters, dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, oxidative stress, and abnormal inflammatory responses [27]. Among them, the volume of brain regions, neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus, and antioxidant capacity are greatly affected by spaceflight. These physiological indicators with abnormal changes have become the targets for studying the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments [28,29,30]. Besides other factors such as space radiation, isolation and confinement, and circadian rhythm disorders, increasing evidence suggests that microgravity itself can affect the brain through multiple mechanisms, including vestibular deprivation, weightlessness, and cerebrospinal fluid shift [31].In addition, gut microbiota, as a research hotspot involved in the regulation of multiple physiological systems of the body in recent years, has also been reported to undergo abnormal changes after spaceflight. Although changes in gut microbiota during spaceflight have attracted the attention of relevant scholars, there are few reports on its role in the process of liver and brain abnormalities in the body after flight. Ground-based studies have found that gut microbiota can interact with the body through pathways such as the liver–gut axis and the brain–gut axis. The key pathway among them refers to the neurohumoral network through which intestinal functions communicate with the liver and brain. This pathway integrates multiple elements such as nerves, hormones, and metabolism [32]. In order to study microgravity effects at different levels, ground-based experiments often need to establish different models, including cell models, Caenorhabditis elegans models, and mouse models. For the mouse model, weight loss and bone loss are extremely important changes, and this characteristic is often used as a sign of the successful simulation of microgravity in ground-based mouse models [33,34]. Traditional ground-based microgravity mouse models mainly simulate microgravity by completely unloading or inducing limb disuse [35]. However, tail suspension still causes certain mechanical injuries to mice, which may have an impact on the simulation results of microgravity [36]. The 3D-Clinostat, independently developed by the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is often used to study the microgravity effects on model plants and the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans. Its principle is to continuously and randomly adjust the experimental samples in the center of the frame in the biaxial direction, averaging the gravity vector close to zero [37].This study is based on the principle of the 3D-Clinostat causing bone loss in mice to establish a new microgravity model in mice, and explores the effects of microgravity on the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in mice. Combined with the functional prediction of PICRUST 2, behavioral experiments, and a series of physiological and biochemical tests of liver and brain tissues, it has been verified that microgravity changes the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profile, with abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues. Furthermore, through fecal microbiota transplantation technology, we have also explored the important role of the imbalance of gut microbiota in the abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues caused by microgravity."

        "Title": "Genomic Characterization of Potential Plant Growth-Promoting Features of Sphingomonas Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIn an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several\nSphingomonas\nstrains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as\nSphingomonas sanguinis\n(\nn\n= 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as\nSphingomonas paucimobilis\n. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23\nSphingomonas\nspecies. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for\nS. sanguinis\nin the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS\nS. sanguinis\nisolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these\nSphingomonas\nstrains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized\nSphingomonas\nsp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the\nS. sanguinis\nand\nS. paucimobilis\nstrains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related\nS. sanguinis\nand\nS. paucimobilis\nstrains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.\nIMPORTANCE\nSphingomonas\nis ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the\nSphingomonas\ngenus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of\nSphingomonas\nmembers from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future\nin situ\nstudies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS\nSphingomonas\nisolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.\nKEYWORDS:\nSphingomonas\n, International Space Station, phytohormones, plant growth promotion",

        "Title": "Genomic Characterization of the Titan-like Cell Producing Naganishia tulchinskyi, the First Novel Eukaryote Isolated from the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMultiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus\nNaganishia\nwere isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO\n2\nconditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus\nNaganishia\nand were clustered with\nNaganishia diffluens\n. The name\nNaganishia tulchinskyi\nis proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1\nT\nas the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.\nKeywords:\nNaganisha tulchinskyi\n, yeast, International Space Station, phylogenetic analyses, Titan-like cells, simulated microgravity",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe genusNaganishia[1] was resurrected fromCryptococcusand emended to accommodate thealbidusclade ofFilobasidiales, Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota [2,3,4]. The genusNaganishiacontains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank:N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. diffluens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae, andN. vishniacii[2,3,4]. However, the addition ofN. floricolamade the list a total of 20Naganishiaspecies, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the familyTremellomyceteswere isolated [5], and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated [6]. Some of theNaganishiaspecies that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica [4,7,8,9,10,11], also reported that the ISSNaganishiaspecies might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition,Naganishiaspecies were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water [12], soil [13], tree trunk [14], air [12], Alpine glaciers [15], cheese, cereals [16], and human specimens [12].Members of theCryptococcusspecies, from whichNaganishiaspecies have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis [17,18]. The morphological transformation of normalCryptococcuscells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection) [19,20,21]. It was also reported that titanization was unique to theCryptococcus neoformans/C. gattiispecies complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under similar growth conditions [21]. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported inCryptococcus terreus. The ISSNaganishiastrains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to theC. neoformans/C. gattiispecies complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions.One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novelNaganishiaspecies isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology whenNaganishiaspecies were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5% CO2and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identification of genetic determinants related to cold adaptation and radiation resistance inN. tulchinskyi. The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISSNaganishiastrains (n= 4) using microscopy and taxonomic affiliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU,CYTB,RPB1,RPB2,TEF1) phylogeny [2]."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nRecent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization.\nResults\nThrough a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome.

        "Title": "Microbial Burden Estimation of Food Items, Built Environments, and the International Space Station Using Film Media",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R\n2\nvalues of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R\n2\nvalues of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 10\n3\nCFU per 100 cm\n2\n, had R\n2\nvalues of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.\nKeywords:\nCFU, International Space Station, environmental microbiome, agar media, film media, Easy Plate, Petrifilm",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionCounts of cultivable bacteria and fungi from food items, water samples, and surfaces are a traditional mainstay for public health standards and assessment, as well as the core method that NASA uses to ensure that any craft or robot launched into space meets planetary protection regulations [1]. Preparing, plating, incubating, and counting samples using traditional agar plates, however, generates a great deal of plastic and organic waste and can be prohibitive in terms of the time and space required. Obtaining cultivable microbial counts from low-biomass arenas, including pure water samples, hospitals, clean rooms, and space habitats such as the International Space Station (ISS), presents additional challenges. The samples from these environments are often below detection limits when using standard plating methodology and dilutions [2,3,4], requiring larger numbers and volumes of samples to characterize microbial bioburden [5]. During a survey of multiple NASA clean rooms, for example, more than 30% of samples were below the detection limit for measuring the number of cultivable microbes [6]. In addition, the whole-genome sequencing of isolated fungi and bacteria from cultivable approaches is often necessary for further phenotypic and genomic characterization, which can be used to understand the functional and physiological traits of cultivable microorganisms. For example, isolates from hospitals and human habitats are often assessed for changes or increases in virulence and antibiotic resistance, e.g., [7,8,9]. Similarly, the NASA community is in need of understanding the yet-to-be cultured microorganisms for their possible survival or proliferation in extraterrestrial conditions [10,11,12,13]. Therefore, any improvements or changes in plating methods must not only produce cultivable microbial counts comparable to traditional methods but must also not change the ratios or types of the isolated species.For the last 50 years, miniaturized stackable media called “film” media have been available as alternatives to traditional agar [14]. Petrifilm was developed by 3M in the 1980s as an alternative to agar spread and pour plates. It consists of a thin wafer of nutrient/gelling agent between two plastic films. Petrifilm was designed to plate 1 mL of a sample on a surface with the approximate size and volume of a playing card, using dyes such as tetrazolium to indicate colony growth [15]. This greatly reduces both the volume of incubator space needed to grow a large number of samples and the time and materials needed to prepare agar plates. According to 3M, Petrifilm media “take up 85% less space, reduce waste 66%, greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, and water waste by 79%” compared with agar plates [15]. Recently, Kikkoman/Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) has developed another brand of film media, Easy Plates, which are similar to Petrifilm in many respects but which have the advantage of a hydrophobic resin ring surrounding the medium which negates the use of a spreader tool, reducing preparation time even further. In addition, the Easy Plate design purportedly increases the ease of counting by its reduced liquefaction of the gel compared with Petrifilm [16].Previous reports on Petrifilm media found that they produced statistically similar results for cultivable microbial counts to those of agar plate methods for food and environmental safety testing, including aerobic bacteria in raw milk [17], poultry [18], fungal counts on dairy products [19], food items spiked with a variety of common molds [20], and aerobic or coliform bacteria in wastewater [21]. More recent studies showed that film media obtained equivalent counts to agar for soil samples inoculated with varying concentrations ofE. coli[22], steel and porcelain surfaces inoculated with ubiquitous built-environment bacteria [23], biofilm samples using drop plating [24], and bacterial counts on a variety of food items [25]. There has also been extensive testing of film media in the dairy industry which is leading to the adoption of Petrifilm as a standard method for the enumeration of aerobic and coliform bacteria [26,27,28,29]. Petrifilm is now becoming a widely used method of bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counting and isolation in place of agar media [29,30].Most studies testing film vs. agar media performance for cultivable microbial counts have focused on high-bioburden environments and samples such as dairy products and food, or samples/surfaces that are pre-inoculated with a known microbial consortium. Film media are only recently being assessed for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms and hospitals [31,32,33]. Recently, researchers from NASA compared Petrifilm Rapid Aerobic Count (RAC) plates with tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates for measuring the bioburden of an extremely low-biomass clean room environment and found that Petrifilm was equal to TSA plates in aerobic bacterial estimation [31]. In addition, Petrifilm was found to be superior to TSA in containing colonies that could spread and grow to cover 25% or more area of agar plate [31].Kikkoman’s Easy Plates have not yet been compared in the scientific literature for their performance relative to both agar plates and Petrifilm. While film media have been previously used in place of agar plating to assess cultivable microbial counts for built environments and hospitals [30], they have not been tested in extremely low-biomass environments, particularly those with high fiber counts. Additionally, because Easy Plates entirely rely on water adhesion/cohesion forces for inoculation rather than manual spreading, it is likely that they could be viable options for environmental monitoring in micro- or low-gravity settings in future space installations.Therefore, our objectives for this study were to (1) test the bacterial enumeration performance among agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates for a variety of food items; (2) compare the cultivable microbial counts in an Earth-built-environment setting for agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates using bacterial- and fungal-specific media; and (3) test the efficacy of Easy Plates as an alternative method for bacterial and fungal bioburden estimation and the isolation of bacterial and fungal strains for surface samples from the ISS, for both cultivable microbial counts and species composition of isolates."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionAny bacterial species introduced into space will inevitably face the extreme pressures inherent therein (e.g., microgravity and solar radiation). While humans also encounter these challenges during space flight and, indeed, our physiology is impacted by prolonged exposure—microbes possess the unique ability to adapt quickly due to rapid cell division (thereby mutation) and the acquisition of external DNA elements through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1]. Given the pivotal roles microbes play in human health and physiology (e.g., ranging from pathogens to arbiters of a healthy gut), understanding how we can expect specific microbes to adapt to space-based ecosystems is essential for ensuring crew safety and health during longer space missions.The International Space Station (ISS) is perhaps the paradigm of experimental “built environments” to observe such microbial adaptation in action. After all, all life on the ISS had to originate on Earth, and this makes it the ideal place to study, in a contained environment, how life changes in orbit. To date, there have been numerous other examples of microbes changing after being exposed to space. These include fungal adaptation to the ISS as a function of microgravity and changes inAgrobacteriumgenome composition, among others [2–4].Recently, the microbeAcinetobacter pittiiwas isolated from surfaces within the ISS during two microbial-monitoring missions (referred to as microbial tracking-1 [MT1] and microbial tracking-2 [MT2]) [2,5].A. pittiiis an opportunistic, Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 pathogen capable of causing potentially fatal infection, most commonly in immunocompromised patients in clinical settings [6,7]. Bacteremia deriving fromA. pittiihas been observed as having a 17% 28-day mortality rate [8], though healthy individuals are usually not at risk of infection. Members of the genusAcinetobactertend to be multi-drug-resistant and more commonly isolated from hospital settings as a result of their ability to resist environmental disinfectants and their potential for aerosolization [9]. In addition,A. pittiihas been observed in various built environment settings other than hospitals (e.g., household objects) [10]. Many diverseA. pittiigenomes are available from a variety of settings, making it an excellent model for comparative genomics.The presence of a nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen in space warrants investigation in and of itself as the potential for human infection in this extreme environment raises concern; additionally,A. pittiiis particularly adept at HGT in a simulated microgravity [1]. This indicates a propensity for rapid adaptation to conditions aboard the ISS and acquiring additional genes that could contribute to antibiotic resistance. As a result, monitoring the biology ofA. pittii, and how strains are changing in space, is of high priority. Finally, understanding how an organism, especially a pathogen, is changing and whether it is propagating is critical to our ability to design effective infection prevention strategies. In other words, is it colonizing and spreading via the human body, or is it limited to the environment? Answering this metapangenomic [11] question requires both longitudinal sampling of human (e.g., the oral microbiome) and environmental (e.g., the space station viewports) metagenomes to identify the presence or absence of specific strains in complex microbial communities over time.Here, we jointly used longitudinally collected isolates and metagenomic sequencing to measure changes toA. pittiigenomes across time in space. We compared clinical strains isolated on Earth to cultured organisms from the space station and those de novo assembled into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We described the specific gene and phenotype changes possibly occurring as a function of exposure to space, and we identified whereA. pittiiis most prevalent across the ISS."

However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics.\nResults\nIn total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (\nKalamiella piersonii\n) and one novel bacterial species (\nMethylobacterium ajmalii\n). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space.

Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the\nEnterobacter bugandensis\nMAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.\nConclusions\nComparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionSince the publication of the first metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) in 2004 [1], MAGs have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host-microbe relationships [2]. When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms likeCandidatus Amarolinea aalborgensisgen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera likeSpiribacter[6] andKalamiella[7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12].Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13].Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species,Kalamiella piersonii[7]. We have retrieved fourK. piersoniiMAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related generaPantoeafromKalamiellaand facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n= 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species,Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14].The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy."

        "Title": "Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA single strain from the family\nPaenibacillaceae\nwas isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus\nCohnella\n, designated as F6_2S_P_1\nT\n. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1\nT\nstrain places it in a clade with\nC. rhizosphaerae\nand\nC. ginsengisoli\n, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1\nT\nare to\nC. rhizosphaerae\nwith 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available\nCohnella\ngenomes places it as more closely related to\nC. ginsengisoli\n. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described\nCohnella\nspecies are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1\nT\nare anteiso-C\n15:0\n(51.7%), iso-C\n16:0\n(23.1%), and iso-C\n15:0\n(10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus\nCohnella\nfor which we propose the name\nCohnella hashimotonis\n, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1\nT\n(=NRRL B-65657\nT\nand DSMZ 115098\nT\n). Because no closely related\nCohnella\ngenomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for\nC. rhizosphaerae\nand\nC. ginsengisoli\n. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1\nT\n,\nC. rhizosphaerae\n, and\nC. ginsengisoli\n, along with two uncharacterized\nCohnella\nstrains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of\nCohnella\nspecies, and form a distinct clade branching off from\nC. nanjingensis\n.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al.,2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019; Urbaniak et al.,2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al.,2004; Checinska et al.,2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al.,2016; Venkateswaran et al.,2017; Urbaniak et al.,2018; Bijlani et al.,2020; Daudu et al.,2020; Solomon et al.,2020; Blachowicz et al.,2021; Simpson et al.,2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al.,2018; Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019; Urbaniak et al.,2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the generaBacillusandPaenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genusCohnellahas been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al.,2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1Twas isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1Tin the genusCohnella.The genusCohnella(familyPaenibacillaceae, orderBacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genusPaenibacillus, with the description ofCohnella thermotolerans(type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification ofPaenibacillus hongkongensisasCohnella hongkongensis(Teng et al.,2003).Cohnellaspecies are differentiated fromPaenibacillusdue to high iso-C16:0content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al.,2006). Members ofCohnellaare rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive.Cohnellaspecies have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al.,2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Flores-Felix et al.,2014) and compost heaps (He et al.,2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al.,2020; Hero et al.,2021; Chen et al.,2022; Mohammadi et al.,2022). As with the genusPaenibacillus, many members of the genusCohnellaare strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al.,2018). Multiple novelCohnellaspecies have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Wang et al.,2012,2015; Flores-Felix et al.,2014; Takada et al.,2019).Cohnellaspecies are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al.,2010; Hameed et al.,2013; Hero et al.,2021; Johnson et al.,2021). Overall, whileCohnellaspecies have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al.,2003; Abou Abdallah et al.,2019; Kim et al.,2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals.In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1Tand describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establishCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tas a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1Tshowed that it was most closely related to fourCohnellaspecies without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al.,2010; Kampfer et al.,2014). Thus, the strainsCohnella ginsengisoliDSM 18997TandCohnella rhizosphaeraeDSM 28161Twere acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species.The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1Twithin the genusCohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genusCohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1Tis part of a branch of the genusCohnellawhich is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1Tis a member were characterized."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nKlebsiella\nspecies, such as\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n,\nKlebsiella aerogenes\n, and\nKlebsiella quasipneumoniae\n, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n(hvKP) is a subgroup of\nK. pneumoniae,\nwhich has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of\nKlebsiella\nisolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of\nK. pneumoniae\n,\nK. aerogenes\n, and\nK. quasipneumoniae\noffered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with\nK. quasipneumoniae\nST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding\nK. pneumoniae,\nbelonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some\nKlebsiella\ngenomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health.\nIMPORTANCE\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10\nKlebsiella\nisolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that\nKlebsiella quasipneumoniae\nST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from\nKlebsiella\nspecies of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nisolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of\nKlebsiella\nspecies during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.\nKEYWORDS:\nhypervirulence,\nKlebsiella\n, microgravity, International Space Station",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows:\nArthrobacter burdickii\nIIF3SC-B10\nT\n(= NRRL B-65660\nT\n= DSM 115933\nT\n),\nLeifsonia virtsii\nF6_8S_P_1A\nT\n(= NRRL B-65661\nT\n= DSM 115931\nT\n),\nLeifsonia williamsii\nF6_8S_P_1B\nT\n(= NRRL B-65662\nT\n= DSM 115932\nT\n),\nPaenibacillus vandeheii\nF6_3S_P_1C\nT\n(= NRRL B-65663\nT\n= DSM 115940\nT\n), and\nSporosarcina highlanderae\nF6_3S_P_2\nT\n(= NRRL B-65664\nT\n= DSM 115943\nT\n). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.\nSubject terms:\nEnvironmental microbiology, Functional genomics, Genome, Prokaryote",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMultiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial entities as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station (ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces of the crew resupply vehicles1and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104CFU/100 cm2bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2fungi)3.Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains ofAcinetobacter pittiifrom ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research.Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results.In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial generaStaphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, andAcinetobacter, yeast genusRhodotorula, and fungal generaPenicillium,Aureobasidium, andAspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, PaenibacillusandSporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species.One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionMicroorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO2levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [6]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [3,7], identifying novel microorganisms [8–11], studying antibiotic resistance [12] to unveiling microbial interactions [13].Enterobacter bugandensis, a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within theEnterobactergenus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [14,15]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [16]. In addition, someEnterobacterspecies act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [17]. Moreover, with time,Enterobacterisolates have been shown to manifest multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-spectrumβ-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [18], and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE pathogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistantE. bugandensisstrains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [1,19]. Motivated by the presence ofE. bugandensison the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derivedE. bugandensisgenomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly driven by the unique stresses of space.Expanding our investigations, we further examined metagenomic reads to map the prevalence ofE. bugandensisacross diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting microbial communities ofE. bugandensisin ISS across multiple flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate microbial interactions ofE. bugandensiswithin the ISS were unveiled using a combination of robust computational approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig.1) not only sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial diversity and contribute to the potential succession ofE. bugandensiswithin the unique ISS habitat but also aids in designing strategic preventive measures against infections caused by pathogens.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabIllustrative workflow showcasing the process of comparative genomics analysis ofE. bugandensis, evaluating its prevalence and metabolic interactions within the microbial community, and its successful adaptation within the ISS habitat"

As a result, ISS surfaces are required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< 104CFU/100 cm2bacteria and < 100 CFU/100 cm2fungi)3.Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bacterial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during further sampling campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains ofAcinetobacter pittiifrom ISS surfaces during different years and sampling campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desiccation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile grounds for biotechnology applications research.Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results.In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 microbial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Dominant microbial species include bacterial generaStaphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, andAcinetobacter, yeast genusRhodotorula, and fungal generaPenicillium,Aureobasidium, andAspergillus9–25. In this communication, six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constituting four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, PaenibacillusandSporosarcina) are described. Since recent bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species.One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quantify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and interact in ISS conditions."

        "Title": "Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.\nResults\nIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.\nConclusion\nOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe environment of outer space, characterized by intense radiation and high vacuum, presents harsh conditions for any form of life. Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g.,Bacillus,Deinococcusspecies) [1,2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6,7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13].The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure,Bacillus pumilusSAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, driedDeinococcuscell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover,D. radioduransafter being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival ofD. radioduransexposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis ofB. pumilusSAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores ofB. pumilusSAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1].The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10,15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes.Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10,12,18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17,20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species,Bacillus safensisJPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24].This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig.1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabOverview of the project.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionFilamentous fungi, such as species found within the genusAspergillus, are well known producers of secondary metabolites (SMs) with interesting biological activities. The genome sequencing ofAspergillusspecies revealed that the number of putative SM genes greatly exceeds the number of identified SMs, suggesting many novel types of SMs still remain to be discovered.1In general, these SM genes are clustered in the genome.2A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton. These genes usually encode large multidomain enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) class.3Other adjacent genes encode enzymes that are involved in tailoring modifications, transport of the product, or co-regulation of the cluster genes.4In a given fungal species, the SM arsenal is usually governed by the number of key synthetic genes in the genome, and this diversity is multiplied by various tailoring enzymes that give rise to a considerable number of different natural products.5For instance, the fungusA. nidulanshas 27 PKS genes, 12 NRPS genes, 14 NRPS-like genes and one PKS/NRPS hybrid gene.6In a previous study, Ahujaet al.systematically characterized the polyketide products of eight non reducing PKSs (NR-PKSs) inA. nidulans.5In combination with the six previously characterized NR-PKS genes, the study demonstrated that the 14 NR-PKS genes inA. nidulanscould be divided into seven groups based on phylogenetic analysis. More importantly, each of these NR-PKSs produces a unique product which can be modified by other tailoring enzymes and incorporate into various SM biosynthetic pathways, indicating the potential ofA. nidulansfor biosynthesizing a large variety of different PKS-derived SMs.5Recently, application of an efficient gene targeting system enabled us to link two NRPS-like genesapvAandbtyAto their corresponding SMs, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, respectively, inA. terreusstrain NIH 2624.7In this study, we demonstrated that one NRPS-like gene,atmelA, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus.7Compared to typical NRPSs, NRPS-like genes encode single module (A-T-TE) proteins missing the condensation (C) domain.3,8The adenylation (A) domain is responsible for aryl acid substrate recognition and activation. The activated substrate is loaded onto the thiolation (T) domain. The thioesterase (TE) domain is suggested to be involved in the condensation and releasing of the final product.8Therefore, the diversity of NRPS-like products is expanded by a combination of different A domains (substrate selection and activation) and TE domains (various cyclization and release mechanisms). TheA. terreusgenome contains 14 NRPS-like genes with predicted A-T-TE or similar domain architecture and the SM products for the majority of these are unknown.Here we report our efforts to systematically characterize the products of these 14 NRPS-like genes. We heterologously expressed each gene inA. nidulansunder the control of the induciblealcApromoter. Surprisingly, our study reveals that two NRPS-like genes,apvAandatmelA, are responsible for the formation of the same intermediate, aspulvinone E (1,Fig. 1A). The aspulvinone E produced by AtmelA is further modified by a tyrosinase, AtmelB, and is incorporated into the brown melanin biosynthesis pathway inA. terreus(Fig. 1A). In parallel, the aspulvinone E synthesized by ApvA is further prenylated by atrans-prenyltransferase (AbpB) to produce aspulvinones (Fig. 1B). AbpB also prenylates butyrolactones, and this reveals that modifying genes outside of specific clusters can be responsible for modifying compounds from more than one SM gene cluster, thus expanding the diversity of SMs produced by an organism (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1. (A) AtmelA and ApvA may synthesize the identical natural product1accumulated in different fungal tissues. (B) Atrans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones.Open in a new tabOur results suggest that the promoter ofapvAdrives expression in hyphae resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1), which is modified to produce aspulvinone variants. TheatmelApromoter drives expression in conidia, also resulting in the production of aspulvinone E (1) but in this cell type it is converted to melanin. Further genetic analysis ofapvAandatmelAindicates that these two genes may share a common ancestral gene. The geneapvA, which may result from duplication of the ancestral gene, is inserted in a genomic region consisting of genes that codes for life-essential proteins. Our study suggests an unprecedented pathway for conidial pigment biosynthesis inA. terreusthat incorporates an NRPS-like product aspulvinone E (1) as its substrate (Fig. 1). Our data also demonstrated how the SM diversity can be expanded by (1) allocating the same natural product in different fungal compartments to produce molecules with different functions; (2) encoding tailoring enzyme that is capable of chemically modifying more than one type of SMs."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSecondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionFilamentous fungi, including those within theAspergillusgenus, are known to produce a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs) that exhibit a broad range of biological activities. SMs are organic small molecules that confer selective advantage to the organism despite not being directly required for survival. In nature, SMs function as weapons to eliminate neighboring competition, chemical signals in microbial cell communication, agents of symbiosis and transportation, sexual hormones, or differentiation effectors.1However, SMs also possess various characteristics that make them great drug candidates, which has resulted in their extensive use in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, they exhibit enormous structural and chemical diversity due to the enzymatic nature of their biosynthesis, in which the core backbone of the SM is often biosynthesized by either a polyketide synthase (PKS), which can be either non-reducing (NR-PKS) or highly-reducing (HR-PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a PKS–NRPS hybrid, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), or a terpene cyclase (TC). The carbon skeleton is then further diversified by various tailoring enzymes encoded by genes that are usually clustered in the genome with the SM core backbone gene.2Tailoring enzymes may include oxidoreductases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases, reductases, and transferases. This process facilitates many reactions that are not possible synthetically and therefore SMs often feature more chiral centers and increased steric complexity than synthetic molecules. Further, because SMs have evolved within a biological setting, they usually possess many favorable drug-like properties. SMs currently represent a significant source of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-infective, anticancer, and antidiabetic drugs.3Notable examples include the antibiotic penicillin, the cholesterol-lowering statin lovastatin, the antitumor agent paclitaxel,4and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine.5Additionally, the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore, and approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs.3Genome sequencing ofAspergillusspecies has greatly illuminated the potential for further drug discovery within theAspergillusgenus, revealing that the number of predicted SM biosynthetic genes or gene clusters considerably exceeds the number of identified SMs. A primary reason for this is that the majority of genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions.6This is a logical phenomenon given the natural functions of SMs, as laboratory culture conditions lack the life-threatening or competitive circumstances likely to trigger SM production. Expression of these genes sometimes requires exposure to a specific condition or stressful environment, and therefore culturing fungi in various conditions can result in the production of different SMs.7Other times, genetic engineering techniques, such as heterologous expression or the use of inducible promoters, are required. Since the sequencing of the firstAspergillusgenome in 2005,8researchers have used bioinformatics to identify and characterize the SM biosynthetic gene clusters present in various species ofAspergillus.9There have been considerable efforts to activate silent clusters and link them to their downstream products, as genome mining these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery.10Further, linking known therapeutically-relevant SMs to their biosynthesis genes facilitates genetic manipulation efforts to optimize product yields of first-generation compounds and engineer second-generation compounds.In 2012, a comprehensive review depicting the statusAspergillusSM research was published by J. F. Sanchezet al.11Building on this previous work, this review examines advances made inAspergillusSM genome mining efforts since 2012. Specifically, it focuses on progress made within the species ofAspergillus nidulans,Aspergillus fumigatus,Aspergillus niger, andAspergillus terreus, which are distinguished for their significant use in research, medicine, and biotechnology. The well-characterized fungusA. nidulanshas been extensively used as a model organism to study genetics and cell biology. Additionally, the development ofA. nidulans“clean background” strains, which are lacking production of common SMs, combined with the availability of regulatable promoters and several genetic selection markers have facilitated its wide use as a heterologous expression host.12The common airborne pathogenA. fumigatusthreatens immunocompromised individuals and is responsible for most invasive aspergillosis infections, although infections can also be caused byA. flavus,A. terreus,A. niger, andA. nidulans.13,14Nevertheless,A. fumigatusis known to produce biologically useful SMs, including fumitremorgin C, which exhibits potent activity against the breast cancer resistance protein.15MelanizedA. nigeris used extensively in the biotechnology industry for production of citric acid and enzymes.16Additionally, it produces an array of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antimicrobial aurasperone A,17the antioxidant and antifungal aurasperone B,18the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A,19and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A.20A. terreusis used for biotechnological production of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin21,22and the industrial polymer precursor itaconic acid.23,24"

        "Title": "Cortical thinning and structural bone changes in non-human primates after single-fraction whole-chest irradiation.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nStereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture (\n1\n–\n5\n). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT (\n6\n–\n11\n). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRadiation therapy (RT) is a risk factor for bone morbidity and fracture (12–15). Vertebral RT significantly increases the risk of post-treatment vertebral compression fracture (VCF) (1–5). Acute structural bone changes have been reported following pelvic (13), lumbar spine (16,17), and thoracic RT (6), however clinically relevant data on this topic is currently limited.Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) are two of the primary metrics used to quantitatively describe bone structural changes and predict for fracture risk (6,18,19). The severity of RT-induced structural changes appears be impacted by both dose and age at irradiation (17,20,21). Wei et al. showed that doses as low as 5 Gy correlated with significant BMD loss (>20%) within just 4 months of irradiation (IR), and this effect was persistent at 9 month follow-up (17). While data regarding acute changes in BMD post-RT from clinical studies is limited, literature describing the acute changes in Ct.Th post-RT that could predispose to fracture are nearly absent (13). This is due to limitations in conventional computed tomography (CT) resolution of follow-up scans. Both decreased Ct.Th and BMD may predispose those at highest risk of VCF towards progression and collapse with symptoms (22). Early identification of those at highest risk for RT induced bone changes could potentially allow for better selection for prophylactic interventions(15). The effects of RT are difficult to study using clinical data alone due to numerous confounding factors. These factors include chemotherapy,(23) steroids,(24) reduced mobility,(25) and direct bony infiltration by tumor,(26,27) which are all detrimental to bone health.Non-human primates are a good model for studying bone related changes that can be translated to expected responses in humans. These NHPs exhibit both changes of normal aging and response to fractionated RT that is well correlated with what has been shown in humans (28–31). In the present study, we assessed the subacute, longitudinal effects of IR on vertebral structural properties (e.g., Ct.Th and BMD) in rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) when irradiated prior to or after skeletal maturity. Our goal was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae of NHPs post-irradiation (IR) that we could assess using our cortical thickness and dose mapping approach for measuring longitudinal architectural and density changes."

Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading.\nRadiat. Res.\n191, 497–506 (2019).\nReduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.",

Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate. The review focuses on the skeletal, ocular, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cells responses.\nKeywords:\nHind limb unloading, tail suspension, radiation, spaceflight, cognition, cardiovascular, SANS, bone, stem cell",

        "Title": "Spaceflight and hind limb unloading induces an arthritic phenotype in knee articular cartilage and menisci of rodents",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nReduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.\nSubject terms:\nPhysiology, Structural biology, Anatomy, Pathogenesis",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionOsteoarthritis (OA) can lead to pain and disability resulting in decreased health-related quality of life, with associated loss of productivity and high treatment-related costs1,2. The reasons for knee OA are thought to be a complex interaction between patient risk factors (age, sex, race, genetic factors, obesity, diet, exercise) and abnormal mechanical loading of the joint (posttraumatic or malalignment)3. In particular, articular cartilage and menisci are sensitive to different loading conditions, and the meniscal degradation and loss of function that occurs in relation to risk factors may result in cartilage degradation and subsequent OA4,5. While excessive loading from patient obesity3or repetitive loading from high impact activities can contribute to OA development6,7, reduced weight-bearing both prescribed and due to a sedentary lifestyle without physical activity have also been associated with cartilage degradation8–15.Reduced weight-bearing studies have demonstrated deterioration of articular cartilage occurs similarly to excessive loading, resulting in cartilage degradation5,6,10,13–15. Cartilage degradation, thinning, and loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGS), which impart compressive properties to cartilage, have been measured in humans after post-surgical limb immobilization and spinal cord injury simulations10,11,15. Even partial loading leads to substantial cartilage loss, with 6–8% of cartilage thinning occurring after less than 2 months10,11. Reduced weight-bearing in rodent models of hind limb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension, or spinal cord injury, likewise results in cartilage degradation16–19. Short-term periods of HLU (13 days) in rats increases pro-arthritic biomarkers in knee cartilage, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and loss of GAG content19. These responses are similar to elevated MMP-3 expression and lower GAG content in rat knees after 21 days of limb immobilization20. Longer periods of HLU (30 days) in female mice results in articular cartilage loss at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point, increases MMP-13 concentration with associated decrease in collagen concentration16, and alters signaling pathways associated with joint degradation in femoral head articular cartilage16. Short-term exposure of chondrocytes to low weight-bearing conditions alters matrix metabolism, however collagen II and proteoglycan production is increased while collagen X is lowered, which could be considered a favorable metabolic response21. In general, short and long term periods of reduced weight-bearing alter chondrocyte metabolism and cartilage health, and is disadvantageous to joint health.Rodents exposed to microgravity in spaceflight experience reduced weight-bearing across joints without the full knee joint immobilization typical of preclinical studies22, representing a unique model to study joint tissue responses to unloading. Rapid bone loss and muscle wasting in both rodents and astronauts are well-documented consequences of the skeletal disuse that occurs during periods of microgravity23,24. Limited data exist regarding rodent joint responses to spaceflight. Of note, sulfated GAG reduction measured histologically from mouse knee articular cartilage was reported after 30 days in orbit aboard the satellite Bion25. Additionally, very few studies have examined the response of menisci to reduced loading in general. The meniscal response to reduced weight-bearing is unclear; preclinical studies identify both degenerative8,26and protective27,28effects of immobilization, but molecular mechanisms for either response are unknown. Further evaluation of microgravity on meniscus cells is necessary to understand the joint degradation that may occur during spaceflight, and the complex relationship these structures play in maintaining joint homeostasis.The purpose of this study was to evaluate how actual and simulated spaceflight conditions with reduced weight-bearing affect both the cartilage and the meniscus of the medial knee compartment, the most common site of knee OA29that experiences the highest loads across the joint30. We hypothesized that reduced-weight bearing would lead to degradation of these structures and a generalized arthritic response. Cartilage and meniscal degradation were measured in male mice after ~ 35 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Rodent Research 9 (RR9) mission31. As a comparative study for the ISS investigation, we examined gross phenotypic and histologic changes in cartilage and menisci from age-matched male mice that were exposed to 30 days of reduced weight-bearing via HLU, followed by a 49 day readaptation (return to weight-bearing) portion that examined if running or climbing exercises could recover any cartilage and meniscal degradation that occurred from 30 days of HLU. The ability of articular cartilage to recover upon a return to normal ambulation and weight-bearing is unclear, with conflicting reports18,19. Finally, meniscal responses in female mice were examined in a short-term mission of 13 days in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135)32. The findings of the current study will provide a characterization and quantification of the anatomic and molecular response of multiple knee soft tissues to reduced weight-bearing conditions, including microgravity. In combination with previous preclinical studies, these data further will elucidate how reduced weight-bearing serves as a hazard for whole knee joint health."

        "Title": "Œ±Klotho decreases after reduced weight-bearing from both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nAlpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney and is a potential systemic biomarker for bone-kidney health during spaceflight. We determined if: (1) plasma αKlotho was reduced after both spaceflight aboard the ISS and hindlimb unloading (HU); and (2) deficiency could be reversed with exercise. Both spaceflight and HU lowered circulating plasma αKlotho: plasma αKlotho recovered with exercise after HU.\nSubject terms:\nPredictive markers, Physiology",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAtrophy of skeletal elements has long been identified as a hazard for the success of long-duration missions and astronaut quality of life1. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) exhibit loss of bone density when comparing pre- and post-flight DXA scan measurements2,3. Bone density reduction for a Mars mission has been estimated of up to 36%4. Recovery from bone degradation appears to be incomplete5,6.The role of the kidneys in skeletal homeostasis is complex. Recent research interest includes the interplay between αKlotho and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)7. Alpha Klotho is secreted predominantly in the kidneys, whereas FGF23 is secreted by osteocytes8. FGF23 binds to αKlotho, and increases urine phosphorous excretion9. Both are required, as seen in mice that demonstrate phosphate retention if either component is deficient10. FGF23 also increases calcium reabsorption7. Through these mechanisms, FGF23 eliminates excess phosphorus and increases plasma calcium, with subsequent decreased calcitriol synthesis and parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. In non-weight-bearing climates with known bone density loss, αKlotho and FGF23 may play a role in skeletal homeostasis.The current spaceflight countermeasures aimed at preventing bone loss provide incomplete protection6,11. The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is utilized for exercise aboard the ISS12. Use of the ARED as a single countermeasure largely maintains preflight skeletal health over a 6-month mission in orbit11, but bone loss is observed by 1 year post-flight, indicating progressive atrophy despite a return to full weight-bearing and from astronauts also receiving bisphosphonate therapy11. Additionally, a device as large and complex as ARED is likely not feasible on an exploration class mission due to limitations in mass and habitable space. These findings add concerns for the current ability to preserve bone health outside low earth orbit.Currently, no reliable real-time analysis of biomarkers or skeletal imaging on orbit exists. Identification of novel circulating biomarkers for musculoskeletal health, such as αKlotho, could prove crucial to protective measures as the space community turns its eyes towards Mars.This pilot investigation measured circulating αKlotho levels in mice after exposure to two reduced weight-bearing conditions: microgravity aboard the ISS, and after hind limb unloading (HU)13. Importantly, musculoskeletal degradation has previously been described in hindlimbs from these same mice after 35 days in microgravity and HU14,15, observing recovery of joint health upon return to full weight-bearing with exercise15. Likewise, this study examined if deficits in circulating αKlotho after periods HU could be recovered after return to full-weight bearing, with/without performing exercise. Changes in α-Klotho after acute bouts of exercise are inconsistent when examining resistance vs aerobic exercise (ref.16), with long term exercise exhibiting elevated αKlotho in sedentary individuals (ref.17). This hypothesis-generating research aims to assess if αKlotho can serve as a circulating biomarker for bone status, both in-flight and upon return to weight-bearing.Data are presented mean(SD). Plasma αKlotho in pg/ml was ~50% lower (Fig.1) after 35 days in orbit aboard the ISS from the FLIGHT mice vs GROUND. No differences were observed between groups for FGF23 or inorganic phosphorus (Pi) concentration (Table1). Additionally, gastrocnemius muscle mass (g) was lower (p= 0.0035) in FLIGHT vs GROUND after time in orbit aboard the ISS (Table1). For the hind limb unloading study, plasma αKlotho after 30 days of tail suspension [HU-30day] was 36% lower vs plasma αKlotho from mice that remained full weight bearing [GROUND-30day;p< 0.01; Fig.2]. Likewise, αKlotho was lower in mice after the initial 30 days of HU vs all mice that were full-weight bearing throughout the entire 80 day study, with or without exercise [GROUND-No exercise; GROUND-Climbing; and GROUND-Running;p< 0.05 for all comparisons)]. In contrast, after returning to full weight-bearing from the 30 day period of HU, plasma αKlotho levels remained lower in the mice that performed no exercise [HU-No Exercise] vs plasma from the full weight bearing mice as measured on Day 30 (p< 0.05). Additionally, these mice that had not performed exercise after the 30 day period of HU were also significantly lower than all GROUND groups on Day 80, regardless of exercise (GROUND-No exercise; GROUND-Climbing; GROUND-Running). In contrast, running exercise for 49 days after the initial 30 day HU period [HU-Running] resulted in partial recovery of plasma Klotho, with no difference vs the full weight bearing group at Day 30 (GROUND-30 Day), but still having lower concentration (p< 0.05) vs GROUND-No Exercise. Climbing exercise [HU-Climbing] for 49 days provided full recovery of αKlotho (Fig.2), being similar to all GROUND groups. No differences were observed between any groups for FGF23 concentration (Fig.3). Moreover, Pi level between GROUND-30day and HU-30day was similar (Table1). Sample limitation prevented the assessment of other groups.Fig. 1. αKlotho concentration is reduced after spaceflight.Open in a new tabFLIGHT mice exhibited lower αKlotho vs GROUND.Pvalue from unpaired t test provided above bars.

Bars: Mean(SD).A reduction in plasma αKlotho levels was observed in both FLIGHT and HU mice vs controls. While a mechanistic/causal link between weight-bearing conditions and αKlotho are not determined, both reduced weight-bearing conditions did result in lowered αKlotho. For HU mice, levels of αKlotho increased following exercise, with partial recovery in the running group and full recovery in the climbing group, suggesting an important relationship between exercise/potentially elevated weight-bearing and αKlotho level improvement. These data are aligned with recovery of joint health upon a return to full weight-bearing with exercise15. Moreover, for FLIGHT mice, where muscle masses were collected, the decrease in αKlotho post-flight occurred with reduced gastrocnemius mass, which itself is not unexpected but αKlotho may also be affected by skeletal muscle activity18.When considering the importance αKlotho plays in maintaining musculoskeletal skeletal health, viewed within the context of the adverse effects of microgravity on bone, as well as muscle, these findings suggest an important link between this hormone level and skeletal health. Histologic changes of bone with altered kidney physiology in relation to these hormonal changes are needed to better understand this relationship. The similar changes in αKlotho found in both FLIGHT mice and HU mice suggest that HU mice may provide an appropriate terrestrial analog for examining the relationship between αKlotho and health along the musculoskeletal tissue-kidney axis."

        "Title": "Prolonged exposure to particulate chromate inhibits RAD51 nuclear import mediator proteins.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nParticulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.\nKeywords:\nNuclear import, Particulate chromium (VI), RAD51C, BRCA2, RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionParticulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is an established human lung carcinogen (IARC, 1990). Epidemiological studies of chromate workers published since 1891 have documented the occurrence of Cr(VI)-induced respiratory cancers (Davies et al., 1991;Newman, 1890;Rosenman and Stanbury, 1996). A wealth of data from animal and cell culture studies further supports the carcinogenic potential of this heavy metal (Balansky et al., 2000;Costa et al., 2010;Levy and Venitt, 1986;Xie et al., 2007). Due to its carcinogenicity and frequent occupational and environmental exposure, particulate Cr(VI) is human health concern (IARC, 1990;OSHA, 2015).A recent study showed Cr(VI) inhibits the high fidelity DNA repair pathway, homologous recombination (HR) in human lung cells (Browning et al., 2016). While HR repair is active after acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure, this repair pathway is inhibited by prolonged (120 h) exposure (Browning et al., 2016). Since HR repair is protective against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage (Stackpole et al., 2007), the inhibition of this repair pathway is an important component in the carcinogenetic mechanism of Cr(VI). This is exemplified by the fact that the Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of HR repair correlates with increased structural chromosome damage (Browning et al., 2016;Qin et al., 2014).We have previously shown prolonged Cr(VI) exposure specifically targets the central HR repair protein, RAD51, by inhibiting protein levels and its proper localization to the nucleus (Browning et al., 2016;Qin et al., 2014). Like many DNA repair proteins and tumor suppressors, RAD51 nuclear transport is crucial to its function (Essers et al., 2002;Fabbro and Henderson, 2003;Gildemeister et al., 2009). Nuclear RAD51 levels are tightly regulated to prevent random recombination events from occurring. Upon DNA damage, RAD51 is transported into the nucleus (Essers et al., 2002;Gildemeister et al., 2009). Thus, Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 subcellular mislocalization is an important component of the mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced HR repair inhibition.Previous studies show BRCA2 and RAD51C both import RAD51 into the nucleus independently of each other (Gildemeister et al., 2009;Jeyasekharan et al., 2013). We previously observed Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 mislocalization to the cytoplasm corresponded temporally with decreased RAD51C foci formation (Browning et al., 2016). This outcome suggests impaired RAD51 nuclear import may be a factor, for Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate the effect of prolonged Cr(VI) exposure on the RAD51 nuclear import mediator proteins, RAD51C and BRCA2, focusing on their interaction with RAD51 and their subcellular localization."

        "Title": "Transcriptomics, NF-Œ∫B Pathway, and Their Potential Spaceflight-Related Health Consequences.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-κB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-κB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.\nKeywords:\ntranscriptome, spaceflight, NF-κB pathway, human disease",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionDifferent from the surface of the Earth, humans in space experience a number of environmental stress factors. In orbits around the Earth or during transit to the Moon or Mars, the lack of gravity is one of the most significant environmental factors responsible for many physiological changes in humans. Gravity of a partial g value can also be experienced on the surface of the Moon or Mars, or artificially generated during transit to these destinations.Apart from microgravity, astronauts are exposed to cosmic radiation during space missions [1]. Although various forms for radiation exist in space, only three sources are of major concern for astronauts’ health. In low Earth orbits (LEO), the majority of radiation comes from protons trapped in the geomagnetic field. In free space, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) consists of high energy particles ranging from protons to extremely heavy ions [2]. Heavy ions are known to have a high linear energy transfer (LET) that can produce greater biological effects than low-LET radiation for the same absorbed dose. During transit to the Moon or Mars, or on the surface of these objects, astronauts are also in danger of exposure to protons released from large solar particle events (SPE). High energy GCR and SPE protons are able to penetrate through the geomagnetic field to reach LEO, especially in high inclination orbits [2].How these environmental factors affect human health has been a major concern for long-duration space missions. Among the reported effects of spaceflight are bone and muscle loss due to disuse of the organs [3,4], and suppression of immune functions [5,6]. Other health risks, such as cancer induced from exposure to space radiation, have been identified for long-duration missions, although no significantly elevated cancer death among the astronauts have been reported [7].Understanding these spaceflight-related health consequences at the molecular level is critical for accurately assessing the associated risks and for the development of effective countermeasures, especially considering the prospect that future medical treatment will be based on individual’s genetic background [8]. In recent years, a number of studies have been reported in which cultured human cells or rodents were flown to space in attempts to uncover any unique molecular pathways in response to the space environment. As opportunities for conducting experiments in space are rare, more studies have been reported using ground based analogs that simulate microgravity. The widely used microgravity analogs are rotating wall vessels (RWV, including 2D clinostats) and the random positioning machine (RPM) for cultured cells [9], and hindlimb unloading (HU) for rodents [10]. For humans, bed rest is used to simulate disuse of the bone and muscle [11]. Space radiation has been simulated on the ground using high energy particles of varying charges and energies generated using accelerators [12]. It has been known that simulated microgravity produces only some, but not all, of the biological effects of the true microgravity condition.Among the different pathways that have been investigated in response to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to be commonly affected in many different cell types and organs of animals. As a protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival, NF-κB is activated in response to external stimuli including infection, inflammation, radiation, and oxidative stress resulting in upregulation of a number of downstream stress response genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) [13,14,15]. The NF-κB family of transcription factors comprises p65 (RELA), RELB, c-REL, NF-κB1 (p50), and NF-κB2 (p52). IκB kinase (IKK) complex controls the activation of NF-κB through the canonical (classical) pathway by degrading the IκB inhibitor and releasing p65/p50 dimers to the nucleus, or through the nuclear translocation of RELB/p52 via a noncanonical (alternative) pathway [16]. Activation of NF-κB/REL protein involves phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB, which in turn results in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/REL proteins [17]. The c-REL subunit is involved in NF-κB heterodimer formation, which forms essential transcription factor complexes involved in all types of cellular processes, including cellular metabolism, and chemotaxis. Previous studies have indicated thatc-RELgene is exclusively expressed in immune cells and plays a role in the regulation of proliferation, adhesion, survival, and immune and inflammatory responses [18]. However, more recent studies demonstrated thatc-RELalso plays a role in non-immune cells. For instance,c-RELdeficient mice are protected from developing cardiac and skin fibrosis indicating a new role ofc-RELin regulating cardiac remodeling and epidermal proliferation and homeostasis [19]. Phosphorylation and acetylation of RELA are crucial post-translational modifications required for NF-κB activation [20].It has been well documented that alterations of the NF-κB pathway are associated with diseases, many of which are of concern for spaceflight [21]. For instance, NF-κB plays a role in osteoclastogenesis [22] and changes in osteoblast activities [23,24]. NF-κB is also suggested to play a role in muscle atrophy due to its increased expression in cardiac cell unloading [25].This review focuses on the NF-κB pathway in response to the space environment. First, we survey omics studies that identified NF-κB as one of the major pathways in response to altered gravity conditions. Then we review the studies specifically targeting NF-κB in the organs or cell types that are associated with the known spaceflight related health risks, including immune dysfunction, bone or muscle loss, CNS dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation exposure. Both studies conducted in space and under simulated spaceflight conditions are considered, and are summarized inTable 1. InTable 2, we summarize the studies using high energy charged particles on the ground.Table 1.Summary of studies on NF-κB in cells or animals conducted in space or using simulated microgravity on the ground.

        "Title": "Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIn space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to address this critical question.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionAs humans on Earth, we are well protected from insults originated in deep space. However, during space travel, all living organisms are exposed to a number of unique environmental stress factors, such as space radiation and microgravity. These two factors in particular have been topics of active investigation as their potential to compromise human health has not yet been fully elucidated.Typically encountered beyond the reach of the Earth’s magnetosphere, space radiation refers to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and protons released from large solar particle events (SPEs). GCRs consist of approximately 87% hydrogen ions (protons) and 12% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1–2% of particles being high atomic number and energy nuclei.1In low Earth orbit (LEO), astronauts are exposed mostly to protons trapped in Earth’s geomagnetic field, and some high energy GCR and SPE particles that are able to penetrate to LEO. In fact, the energy of some GCR particles is so high that it is difficult to shield from them at all using conventional materials,2making exposure inside spacecraft inevitable. Notable effects of this space radiation in humans include, for instance, light flashes from retinal exposure to charged particles,3reported during astronauts’ trips to the Moon4and in Skylab missions,5and the early onset of cataracts.6Apart from direct space radiation effects, indirect damage through bystander effects, adaptive responses, and genomic instability may also occur.7In addition to radiation, in LEO or during transit to the Moon or Mars, astronauts are exposed to microgravity. As many have noted before, exposure to the microgravity environment causes a range of detrimental health effects, including bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, and neurovestibular changes.8,9Furthermore, some of these health effects have been observed in studies using ground-based analogs that simulate the microgravity condition.10At the molecular level, radiation and/or microgravity are known to negatively impact DNA integrity. To counteract DNA damage, cells have developed specific mechanisms that locate and repair DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of a network of cellular proteins involved in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Generally, cells are able to accommodate moderate DNA damage through these different repair processes; however, space conditions, especially the lack of gravity may adversely affect the DNA repair process leading to accumulation of DNA injuries.Although space radiation and microgravity are two major environmental stressors encountered in space travel, other space-related factors can present challenges to DNA integrity as well. Specifically, partial gravity experienced on the surface of the Moon or Mars, psychological stress due to confined space or loneliness in long duration missions, possible toxic chemical compounds in the spacecraft, and lunar or Martian regolith inhaled into the lung might also negatively impact astronauts’ health.Given the importance of understanding the consequences of the space environment on human physiology, this review focuses on the interplay of space radiation and microgravity in the DDR. Relevant studies addressing the question of potential synergies between radiation and microgravity are also discussed. Additionally, investigations of DNA damage induced in space are reviewed. Recent evidence for such effects (Tables1and2) is summarized below.Table 1.Summary of results related to residual DNA damage and DDR from experiments conducted in simulated microgravityRef.EnvironmentExperimental conditions animal/cellular modelDDRR, μG, R + μGResidual damage/DNA repair activitySynergy*Risin and Pellis18Simulated microgravity RWV + radiationPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to137Cs γ rays at a dose rate of 15 Gy/min.Inhibition of radiation-induced apoptosisYesMosesso et al.23Clinostat + radiationHuman lymphocytes were exposed to 1.5 Gy X-ray.Increased yield of chromosome aberrationsYesManti et al.24Simulated microgravity RWV + radiationHuman peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to 60 MeV protons or 250 kVp X-rays in the dose range 0–6 Gy, and allowed to repair DNA damage for 24 h.No differences in radiation-induced chromosome aberrationsNoCanova et al.25Simulated microgravit γ RWV + radiationLymphoblastoid TK6 cells were irradiated with γ rays and incubated for 24 h.

        "Title": "Synergistic Effects of Weightlessness, Isoproterenol, and Radiation on DNA Damage Response and Cytokine Production in Immune Cells",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.\nKeywords:\nradiation, simulated microgravity, DNA damage response, adrenergic receptor, cytokines",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionThe rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor is a suspension culture system that provides the necessary oxygen and nutrients for cells to develop and polarize while they grow under low fluid-shear conditions. The low fluid-shear environment also promotes the colocalization of particles (e.g., cells and/or beads) that allows cells to interact and form aggregates [1]. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) engineers developed the RWV bioreactor system to model space-like microgravity conditions [2,3,4], however researchers are also using this technology in the fields of cancer [5], tissue engineering [6,7], and regenerative medicine [8,9]. When cells are exposed to simulated microgravity several biological processes become dysregulated, including T cell regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration [10,11,12,13,14]. Although many investigators have studied the effects of microgravity and radiation on genes and proteins involved in DNA damage response (DDR), the mechanisms are not well understood. During stress situations, endogenous release of stress hormones affects cellular responses to exogenous factors such us microgravity, radiation, and pathogens. Therefore, we investigated how activated adrenergic receptors and microgravity affect DNA damage response and cytokine production in irradiated cells.1.1. Exogenous Factors Affecting DNA Damage Response (DDR)DDR includes mechanisms for detection, processing, and repair of DNA lesions [15]. Thus, impaired DDR leads to the accumulation of DNA lesions, which increase the risk of genomic instability. Simulated microgravity was found to decrease the expression of DNA repair genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR), base excision repair (BER), and nucleotide excision repair (NER), resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage [16] and an increase in PARP-1 activity [17]. DNA damage can signal repair processes, but it can also trigger apoptosis [18], a secondary response that removes damaged cells to protect tissue function [19]. Immune cells undergo apoptosis during pathological conditions (excessive DNA damage) or physiological processes (deletion of immune cells recognizing self-antigens). In both cases, dysregulation of apoptotic pathways might be detrimental to the integrity of the immune system and could lead to autoimmune disease and immunodeficiency. Genes involved in cell proliferation (CyclinD1 and PCNA) and apoptosis (BAX are downregulated in lymphocytes that are grown in simulated microgravity [16]. Moreover, simulated microgravity has been shown to inhibit radiation-induced apoptosis and activation-induced cell death in stimulated lymphocytes [20]. In stimulated primary CD4+ T cells, p21 mRNA levels increased 4.1-fold after 20s in microgravity during parabolic flight compared to levels in 1gcontrols [21]. These results suggest that T lymphocyte proliferation requires Earth gravity and that the increased expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins contributes to immune depression in space [21].In general, radiation induces apoptosis but the specific response depends on the radiation dose. For example, when mouse splenocytes were exposed to 5 doses of γ-radiation ranging from 0.01 to 2 Gy, the low doses decreased apoptosis prominently in natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) whereas 2 Gy increased apoptosis in all splenocyte subpopulations; B cells were the most sensitive to radiation whereas NK cells and DCs were the least sensitive [22]. Recent studies suggest that a combination of microgravity and low-dose radiation may decrease apoptosis but may potentially increase oxidative stress [23]. Furthermore, a decreased apoptosis rate has been observed in fetal fibroblasts 24 h after exposure to either moderate (0.5 and 1 Gy) or high (4 Gy) doses of X-rays under simulated microgravity [24]. Lymphoblastoid TK6 cells irradiated with γ-rays and incubated for 24 h in a simulated microgravity environment showed significantly less apoptosis, an increased number of cells in G1 cell cycle phase, and a higher frequency of mutations and micronucleated cells than cells maintained in 1g[25]. These results suggest that a combination of microgravity and radiation (at least γ-rays) reduces the rate of apoptosis induced with radiation alone, and, therefore, microgravity increases the frequency of damaged cells that survive after irradiation.1.2. Endogenous Factors Affecting DNA Damage ResponseBoth exogenous factors, such as radiation or absence of gravity, and endogenous factors, such as release of stress hormones or the presence of inflammatory processes, might affect, either directly or indirectly, the integrity of DNA in immune cells, thereby compromising immune function. Lymphocytes are exposed to genotoxic stresses during immune responses (accidental DNA damage) and during development and maturation (programmed DNA damage). Immune cells also incur DNA damage during infectious and inflammatory processes and this triggers the activation of DNA repair pathways. Interestingly, Fontes and colleagues reported recently that DNA repair can affect host immune responses and inflammation [26].Furthermore, exposure to stress affects the immune system’s ability to produce antibodies, making organisms more vulnerable to infections [27]. An immune dysfunction under stress can be due to imbalances in the release of stress hormones, which subsequently activate the receptor-mediated signal. There is considerable evidence that adrenergic pathways are involved in immune system regulation. Although adrenergic modulation of immune cells has been investigated [28], the mechanisms that convert psychological stress into cellular dysfunction are still poorly understood. Researchers have shown that exposure to stress activates NF-B, which coincides with a rapid increase in levels of catecholamines and cortisol in humans [29]. Adrenalin and noradrenalin bind to β-adrenergic receptors leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP, a second messenger involved in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). In immune cells, cAMP acts as signal transducer in several physiological and pathological responses [30]. Both, cAMP and PKA have been associated with apoptosis. In the immune system, activation of cAMP signaling increases apoptosis in human B-precursor cells [31] and delays apoptosis in human neutrophils [32]. Furthermore, stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor or addition of exogenous cAMP can induce apoptosis in thymocytes [33]. Interestingly, activation of cAMP signaling inhibits DNA radiation-induced apoptosis in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) [34]. Moreover, cAMP plays an important role in several immunological processes such as cytolytic activity, antibody production, and cell proliferation. Activated adrenergic receptors trigger the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), inducing the transcription of genes encoding for a variety of cytokines [35]. The adenylyl cyclase-cAMP system inhibits IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha-stimulated production of T Cell-Directed CC Chemokine (TARC), and Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 22 (CCL22) through the NF-B and MAPK pathways [36]. Furthermore, macrophages and lymphocytes provide endogenous sources of catecholamines that regulate inflammatory responses [37].The effect of microgravity on adrenergic pathways is not fully understood. Early studies reported an increase in epinephrine-induced responsiveness in human subjects during head-down bed rest to simulate microgravity [38,39]. More recent studies have shown altered levels of salivary proteins that are associated with β-adrenergic signaling, including a study of cAMP and PKA in mice flown in space [40]. Also, simulated microgravity activates the β-adrenergic receptor leading to the formation of cAMP and activation of PKA and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) [41]. Neuroendocrine hormones such as cortisol and catecholamines are altered in astronauts during spaceflight [42,43], and levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the astronauts’ plasma increase after spaceflight [44]. Adrenergic receptors are present in many cell types including immune cells. The sympathetic nervous system regulates and modulates cell differentiation and function during the immune response. For example, norepinephrine-activated β2-AR increases gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and reduces cell proliferation related cytokines [45]. Adrenaline and cortisone suppress CD69 expression in natural killer cells and this affects the early stages of proliferation and differentiation of these cells [46]. T helper cells (CD4) are the most prolific cytokine producers. This subset of cells can be subdivided into Th1 and Th2, which produce cytokines known as type-1 and type-2 cytokines, respectively [47]. The density of β2-AR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) helps mediate the differential catecholamine effects on cytokine production favoring Th2 responses [48]. Consequently, β-adrenergic agonists shift the balance of human type-1/type-2 cytokine toward a type-2 response [49]. A Th2 response counteracts the Th1-mediated proinflammatory responses responsible for killing intracellular parasites [47]. Therefore, impaired β2-AR signaling due to radiation, microgravity, or the combination of both may also affect immune response. Crucian and colleagues monitored the concentrations of plasma cytokines in 28 astronauts during long-duration spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and found increased levels of the following: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), IL-8, IL-1 ra, thrombopoietin (Tpo), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine ligand 4/macrophage inhibitory protein 1b (CCL4), and C-X-C motif chemokine 5/epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78 (CXCL5) [50]. Cytokine response to radiation varies. For instance, expression of T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2)-type cytokines decreased after low doses of radiation and increased after high doses; IL-6 reacted at early times and IL-10 at later times after radiation exposure; and IL-5 levels were higher in mice after total-body irradiation [22].In the present study, we assessed whether activation of adrenergic response affects or changes how immune cells respond to radiation in simulated microgravity. We measured apoptosis, residual DNA damage and the expression of genes involved in DNA damage response, as well as cytokine production as a marker of immune cell activation."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nTissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in\nArabidopsis thaliana\ntissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionFor the success of transcriptomic and proteomic experiments sufficient quality and quantity of RNA or protein is essential. The ability to accurately preserve samples prior to extraction provides researchers flexibility with experimental design. Snap freezing in liquid nitrogen has been the standard technique for molecular and cell biologists and provides ideal preservation of proteins and nucleic acids for long periods when stored at -80°C. However, field experiments, remote regions of the world, and areas with insufficient infrastructure to allow for access to liquid nitrogen necessitate the use of fixatives [1,2].RNAlater contains high concentrations of quaternary ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates which denature RNases, DNases and proteases to prevent the degradation of RNA [3]. While RNAlater is ineffective in the preservation of fine anatomical and structural features [1], it has been shown to be effective in the preservation of nucleic acids [1,3,4]. RNAlater has been used to successfully preserve high quality DNA for up to 7 years from the date of sample collection and fixation in chimpanzee fecal material collected from remote habitats [1]. Parallel studies of RNAlater and formalin fixation on these fecal samples demonstrated RNAlater to be the superior fixative for the preservation of nucleic acids. In the past decade, studies on human tissues [3,5] and microbes [4] have shown that, in addition to nucleic acids, RNAlater is effective at preserving proteins. Saito et al. [4] analyzed microbial proteins and showed that more proteins were detected in RNAlater preserved samples than in the snap frozen controls. Bennike et al. [3,5] demonstrated protein and RNA integrity, and detection of post-translational modifications are not significantly impacted by RNAlater in human tissue samples.RNAlater has been used for the preservation of plant material as well—especially space flown material grown aboard the international space station [2,6,7,8,9,10]. However, the structure of plant tissues present challenges for the use of fixatives, and how the cell wall impacts permeability of the fixative is unclear. Herein, we present, to our knowledge, the first full ‘omics level study performed to determine the ability of RNAlater to preserve tissue ofArabidopsis thaliana, the primary model organism for plants, for downstream ‘omics-level analyses."

To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated.\nResults\nProteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated\nArabidopsis thaliana\nseedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription.\nConclusions\nThe datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.\nKeywords:\nGravity, Spaceflight, Arabidopsis, Gravitropism, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Phosphorylation, Post-transcriptional gene regulation, Plastid",

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWith the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has pledged to return humans to the Moon in the next two years and land the first humans on Mars by 2033. The journey beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) will expand human civilization, enable future space settlements, provide scientific knowledge of the evolution of our planet and the solar system, and create global partnerships in the quest for further space exploration1,2. Under the Artemis plan, a crewed lunar flyby is scheduled for 2024 (Artemis II), followed by a lunar landing in 2025 (Artemis III)—the first since the end of the Apollo era in 1972, and eventually a sustainable lunar presence by the end of this decade3. Critical to the success of the Artemis program will be Gateway, an orbiting platform where astronauts will live and conduct research, while providing support for lengthy expeditions on the lunar surface. The Artemis program will establish a base camp at the lunar south pole that will serve as a steppingstone for human missions to Mars. Research and development at the lunar base will act as prototypes for these future Mars missions, where NASA can establish best practices for long-term human exploration in these adverse extraterrestrial environments4.Unlike the operation of the International Space Station (ISS), which is regularly resupplied from Earth within hours after launch, deep space missions will require self-sufficiency and sustainability independent of Earth. This will involve utilization of renewable resources, recycling of waste, power generation, and a continuous supply of food, water, and oxygen over a prolonged/indefinite period. The moon is the shortest distance beyond LEO with a deep space environment offering unique research opportunities to be conducted under the Artemis program. The lunar orbiter Gateway will function similarly to the ISS utilizing a Power and Propulsion Element that will use solar energy to propel and power the spacecraft, a Habitation and Logistics Outpost that will serve as the living quarters and research workspace, and docking ports for spacecraft such as Orion, that will be the first of its kind to transport astronauts to and from deep space5,6. The ISS and Earth-orbiting satellites capitalize on solar energy as a renewable resource for power, however in more distant outposts such as Mars, other factors like distance from the sun, angle, and weather (i.e., dust storms) affect the efficiency of energy provided by the solar arrays7. Such was the case with NASA’s Insight mission, where a recent Martian dust storm led to accumulated dust on the solar panels preventing adequate sunlight from reaching them, forcing the lander into battery-conserving “safe mode”8. Similar dust coverage issues were experienced during Apollo missions due to electrically charged lunar dust adhering to solar panels on the lunar lander9,10. Resupply cargo, like those that are frequently sent to the ISS, is costly, and may not be feasible for long-duration space missions (it takes ~7 months to get to Mars). Thus, self-sustainability in food and oxygen production on extraterrestrial outposts, such as on the Moon and Mars, is crucial11. In addition, communication delays between Earth and Mars can range from 5 to 20 min depending on the position of the planets12. Lack of cargo resupply missions and communication delays can be detrimental to human health-related emergencies making it imperative for crew members to be self-sufficient in health risk prevention and treatment. Therefore, solutions to address limited resources and human health risks that can be feasibly implemented in deep space must be established prior to the Artemis and Mars exploration missions. This could be achieved through the exploitation and engineering of microbes important to human health13–16, agriculture17, food production18–20, the ecosystem21–25, and the built environment26,27. Figure1provides an overview of the various roles microbes could play in deep space exploration.Fig. 1. Summary of microbial impact during long-duration space missions.Open in a new tabSpace exploration can benefit from the use of microbes in a variety of applications including incorporation into biological life support systems (BLSS), in situ resource utilization beyond LEO, and astronaut therapeutics. However, increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation during spaceflight could threaten astronaut health and spacecraft integrity so mitigation strategies will be needed to prevent such hazards. Microbial applications related to health (purple), renewable resources (green) or both (purple and green) are highlighted. Figure created with BioRender.com.In this review, we will examine some key considerations for planning crewed space missions that allow for self-sufficiency and sustainability and specifically the role that microbes can play in achieving these goals. We will also discuss the possible detrimental effects of microbes that could derail a mission, such as biofouling and increased pathogenicity, and suggest mitigation strategies to help alleviate some of these concerns."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nFinding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nSubject terms:\nBiotechnology, Applied microbiology, Scientific community, Element cycles",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionHumanity may be tempted to view the cosmos as a rich reservoir of infinite resources. However, the practical reality of space exploration tells a different story. The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefit now and in the long term\"1. Until now, it mainly referred to the need to control, regulate, and remove space debris from low Earth orbit (LEO)2,3and planetary protection (which promotes the implementation and development of the responsible exploration of the solar system, in order to protect the space environments and Earth)3. As humans aspire to venture into deep space, the definition of this concept shifts and expands, and the self-sustainability of mission operations becomes a critical aspect. Loop-closure, which indicates the recycling and the reuse of resources toward the establishment of a circular economy, could greatly enhance the sustainability of space exploration, and it is key not only to minimise the costs of resupply of resources from Earth but also for ethical considerations associated with space waste generation and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments4–10. The United Nations resolved that outer space activities should minimise impacts on the space environment, as well as on Earth, taking into account the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development11,12.The biggest impediment to progress on this frontier is the lack of deployable technologies enabling outposts, extended missions and, in the future, settlements, to sustain themselves through in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and maximised recycling of resources5. In addition to mechanical/physical/chemical approaches, biotechnologies broadly and microorganisms specifically will help enable long-term life-support and habitat systems’ performance (loop-closure), as well as ISRU, manufacturing and energy collection/storage6,7,13–17. Microbiological approaches can be self-sustaining with occasional monitoring and maintenance, owing to their resilience, and could overall require less energy than physicochemical approaches16.Here, we focus on the pivotal roles that microorganisms can play in the development of technologies for sustainable human exploration of deep space, considering two main aspects: (i) the requirement for mature biotechnologies and bioprocesses to allow near closed-loop operations of mission functions, such as life-support, to increase autonomy and sustainability; and (ii) the need to reduce supply chain dependency for the expansion of human presence in space. The approaches presented here are based on processes and technologies currently implemented on Earth at different technology readiness levels (TRL), which must be adapted to meet the specific requirements and challenges of the space environment. Selecting the most suitable bioprocess and most applicable microorganism for any given space application is non-trivial, as terrestrial technologies are rarely readily adaptable to the harsh conditions of space18. Therefore, extensive research and development are compulsory to increase TRL to the point where these technologies can be successfully implemented in space16. Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12."

        "Title": "Longitudinal characterization of multispecies microbial populations recovered from spaceflight potable water",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nWhile sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.\nSubject terms:\nMicrobiome, Biofilms",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionTechnological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6.Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11.The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example,Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, andRhizobialesrecovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40.Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observedBurkholderiaspecies subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth."

        "Title": "Designing a Novel Monitoring Approach for the Effects of Space Travel on Astronauts‚Äô Health",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.\nKeywords:\nspace biology, diagnostic assay, health, transcriptome, space flight",
        "Introduction": "1. Introduction“Space: the final frontier.” [1]. Every fan of the American science fiction TV series Star Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed, space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21stcentury, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space.Space travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under sustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of muscle mass [10,11], reduced bone density [12,13], compromised immune responses [14,15], impaired renal functions [16], neurological system irresponsiveness [17,18], and development of cardiovascular diseases [19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation can cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immunity [21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity affects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in one gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic studies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor, prevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel.Approximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) undertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month mission at the ISS [25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to confirm that space flight changed gene expression in astronauts [25]. Several genes, includingFGF18,ANGPTL7, andCOMP, were upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles. However, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes on the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in the current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that could monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential intervention options."

        "Title": "Overexpression of CupB5 activates alginate overproduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a novel AlgW-dependent mechanism",
        "Abstract": null,
        "Introduction": "IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosais an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production byP. aeruginosais a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection (Folkessonet al., 2012). Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations inmucAresults in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection (Ciofuet al., 2005;Hogardtet al., 2007;Menaet al., 2008). Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics (Govan and Deretic, 1996;Pieret al., 2001;Leidet al., 2005).The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways inP. aeruginosa,Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes (Albaet al., 2002;Kaneharaet al., 2002;Walshet al., 2003;Akiyamaet al., 2004;Flynnet al., 2004;Chabaet al., 2007). InP. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from thealgDpromoter (Martinet al., 1993;Woodet al., 2006).InP. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP (Akiyamaet al., 2004;Albaet al., 2002;Chabaet al., 2007;Flynnet al., 2004;Kaneharaet al., 2002;Qiuet al., 2007;Qiuet al., 2008b;Walshet al., 2003). Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA (Limaet al., 2013).Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of thechaperone/usherpathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Hullet al., 1981;Marklundet al., 1992;Soto and Hultgren, 1999;Valletet al., 2001;Giraudet al., 2011;Mikkelsenet al., 2009). These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria (Saueret al., 2000;Waksman and Hultgren, 2009), contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype inP. aeruginosaand provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling."

        "Title": "Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nIt is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII\n+\nimmune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.\nKeywords:\n:\nburn, lymphatic, macrophage, permeability",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe function ofthe lymphatic system is to maintain fluid and macromolecular homeostasis, regulate the trafficking of antigens and immune cells, and condition the immune response.1–3When these functions are interrupted, the result is often edema accompanied by inflammation and disruption of the immune response in the tissue served by those lymphatics. Examples of this include lymphedema and its association with cellulitis or lymphangiectasia with accompanying disturbances in gut immune responses.4–9Because the lymphatic system is a regulator of fluid physiological homeostasis and also immunological regulation, local disturbances in lymphatic function may have far-reaching systemic effects.10–12Burn injuries are a common traumatic injury and carry a substantial morbidity and mortality risk. According to the American Burn Association, almost 500,000 Americans sustained significant burns in 2016.13–15The mortality rate following burn (including all forms of burn) is 3.3%, whereas those burned by fire or flames have a higher mortality rate of 5.8%.14,15The risk of death associated with burn increases with the size of the burn sustained (% of surface area).16The average cost of hospital stay for burn victims in 2016 was over $250,000.17–19Burns can lead to substantial health consequences, including scarring, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ failure, and long-term fatigue.20–22The association of some of these sequelae with the immune system activation and dysregulation indicates that an exploration of the response of immune mediators warrants further exploration.Traumatic injuries, especially burn, are complex chains of pathologies and physiologic responses.23–25These pathologies often result in increases in circulating cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines, which cause immune activation and increased vascular permeability.26–28Additionally, most major trauma is accompanied by increased intestinal permeability and translocation of intestinal contents, including constituents of the microbiota, and associated development of cytotoxic lymph.29,30Cytotoxic lymph is so named because of its ability to cause dysfunction in a number of different cell types, including cardiomyocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.12,31–37Vascular endothelial dysfunction, and by extension vascular dysfunction, is a major concern after trauma and results in massively increased vascular permeability. This permeability can lead to reduced blood pressure, decreased perfusion, and massive edema, all of which have detrimental effects at sites distant from the injury. Historically, studies have focused on blood vasculature not the lymphatic vasculature in traumatic injury. More recently there have been studies examining the effect of trauma on lymphatic function. However, the techniques used could only demonstrate differential regulation of lymphatic flow after different forms of trauma.38–40During severe burn injuries, lymph flow is increased dramatically, likely due to increased blood vessel leakage and increased interstitial pressures, rapidly causing distal pathologies after insult.40,41The role of lymph as a major contributor to global pathologies after trauma has been supported by animal studies, primarily in models of burn injury and hemorrhagic shock. While the initiating injury for these forms of trauma is vastly different, the resulting pathologies are very similar.23,29,40,42,43Both burns and hemorrhage are associated with increased intestinal epithelial permeability and the development of cytotoxic lymph.27,43–45However, it is unclear what processes are mediating these effects. The first organs to be affected after burn injury and hemorrhagic shock are the heart and the lungs, which are the first organs to receive lymph returned to the great veins in the upper chest.29In hemorrhagic shock, ligation of major lymphatic conduit vessels, the cisterna chyli and the thoracic duct, reduced or eliminated heart and lung injury, confirming the involvement of lymph in these processes.29,31,46Our previous findings show that lymphatic vessels have a unique and larger immunological fingerprint compared with either arteries or veins.47This is due to the association of cells of the innate immune system lying in close proximity to and in some cases integrated into the lymphatic vessel wall. One particular population, MHCII+CD11c−cells, is extremely responsive to inflammatory stimuli. In a model of intestinal inflammation, we have shown that this population begins to increase around the lymphatic vessels in as little as 1 hour after insult.48More importantly, when this cell population increases, there is an immediate shift in the environment surrounding the lymphatic vessel, with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines,48which would affect lymph composition.4,10,49–51We hypothesize that burn injury induces leakage of lymph from lymphatic vessels and that this will cause an increase in the number of MHCII+immune cells to traffic to the perilymphatic space."

The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionMore than two decades of experiments on the ISS have had, and continue to have, a strong impact on research, science, and society as a whole1–3. The growing number of astrobiology and astrochemistry experiments onboard the ISS provides new insights and knowledge, which, via new products, techniques, and technology, have a long-lasting effect on our daily lives and culture4. Astrobiology and astrochemistry address some of the most exciting questions to be asked by humankind, including the origins of life on Earth, life elsewhere in the universe or the exploration and colonization of other planets. A major topic in astrobiology and astrochemistry is radiation and the influence of the space environment or planetary conditions on biological systems and molecules. While laboratory facilities can simulate some individual parameters, it is not currently possible to faithfully replicate the space environment on the ground. In this respect, the ISS provides an excellent platform to perform irradiation experiments beyond the protective atmosphere of the Earth. Beyond the ISS, the design and implementation of new platforms (such as small satellite platforms, CubeSats5–9or the Lunar Orbital Gateway10) offer new possibilities for experiments in space. The latter will rely heavily on machine learning and other advances in artificial intelligence, in particular for navigation11,12and on-the-fly repair of hardware13, a trend that will surely continue in the future.In 2020, the astrobiology and astrochemistry science community in Europe was tasked by ESA to provide an up-to-date scientific roadmap for the utilization of current and future space platforms (ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Papers:esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/HRE/SciSpacE_Roadmaps.pdf). This work was supported by ESA and builds upon work by previous ESA topical teams and experts in the field who extensively reviewed the scientific literature and the possibilities to advance our knowledge and understanding in astrobiology and astrochemistry research3,14,15. In addition to ground-based research, platforms, and concepts for experiments in space have been explored and discussed. To best utilize such space platforms, a number of top science objectives and related sub-objectives were identified. The interdisciplinary nature of this field prevents prioritization among these closely interwoven topics. Figure1shows the main themes and key areas that have been recognized and agreed upon. They consist of (A) Understanding the origins of life, (B) Understanding habitability and the limits of life, and (C) Understanding the signs of life. Each key topic and its sub-topics are described in more detail in the following sections:Fig. 1. Key astrobiology and astrochemistry topics.Open in a new tabAs identified in the 2021 ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper (esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/HRE/10_Biology_Astrobiology.pdf), key astrobiology and astrochemistry topics areAunderstanding the origins of life,Bunderstanding the habitability of life andCunderstanding the signs of life.The origins of life—topic ALife on Earth is currently our only accessible and scientific comprehensive reference for astrobiology studies. How life originated on Earth is a central question to inform and guide our search for life beyond our planet.While the Earth’s environment, with stable liquid water at the surface, is unique in the Solar System today, this was not always the case. When life emerged on Earth (maybe more than 4 billion years ago), the environment was more similar to that of the other early rocky planets in the Solar System, such as Mars or perhaps Venus. Similarly, subsurface liquid water is present on icy moons such as Europa or Enceladus. As these environments resemble subglacial Antarctic lakes found on Earth (which are known to harbor a diverse assemblage of microorganisms16), icy moons are highly interesting candidates in the search for life. Despite these similarities, beyond our solar system and among the expanding number of known exoplanets, an analog of either the early Earth or the Earth today has yet to be found. It is crucial to understand the composition and role of the primitive atmosphere and the lithosphere (e.g., organic synthesis in hydrothermal vents), as well as the role of solar radiation, taking into account a different atmospheric composition than today’s and a faint young sun. These are all critical factors to be addressed in assessing both the specific and general roles of the Earth’s environment.It is now commonly accepted that a significant part of the organic material in early Earth’s environment was provided via meteorites and micrometeorites, originating from carbonaceous asteroids and comets17–19. It is therefore important to understand the origin and formation of such material and how the journey through space influences organic material before it was delivered to Earth. With this in mind, various questions arise regarding the role of exogenous organic material delivery by small cosmic bodies, including but not limited to: where and how was the organic matter formed and how was it incorporated into small bodies or planetesimals; how radiation affects the formation of organic compounds; how much of this material was delivered to Earth; how might the mineral matrix of the small bodies change during space travel; how the physicochemical properties of inorganic and mineral surfaces may have affected the formation, nature, preservation, amount and local distribution of organic material; do these factors play a protective role against space radiation or atmospheric entry; and what is the significance of exogenously delivered organic material versus endogenous organics in the prebiotic chemistry leading to the origins of life20?A key point in studying the origin of life is to understand abiogenesis; the transition from purely chemical, to a molecular prebiotic phase, and finally to a living and replicative system. Defining life as an auto-replicative system that evolves by natural selection, we can state that chemistry naturally spawns biology. Major improvements have been achieved in this field in the past few years21. Organic chemistry and chemical evolution are clearly central to this integrated understanding.Habitability and the limits of life—topic BStudy of life on Earth has shown the astounding ability of living systems to adapt to the most extreme and improbable environments on Earth (withstanding extremes in temperature, pressure, pH, humidity, salinity, radiation dose, and oxidation)22,23. In fact, the majority of terrestrial environments are inhabited by multiple domains of life. The emergence of life on Earth under environmental conditions very different to those reigning today, and the tremendous capacity of life to adapt to and even prosper under conditions that we would consider “extreme”, provide perspective for the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System, and broaden the scope of what the term “habitable” can mean.Many inhabited extreme environments on Earth combine several parameters that are considered (from a human perspective) to be extreme in themselves. The resistance of a given organism to environmental extremes (either naturally occurring or artificial), and how these potential stress-inducing parameters influence its overall response, is an important avenue of research. Some studies of the effects of individual and combined extreme environments can be performed at appropriate field sites on Earth or using simulated environmental parameters in the laboratory24. However, to truly examine the combination of effects induced by the complex space environment, space experiments are a necessity. As such, ground and space-based approaches should be seen as complementary to maximize scientific return. Our improved understanding of characteristics, mechanisms of adaptation, and resistance of astrobiologically relevant and extremophilic organisms to space conditions is critical in understanding the biological effects of the space environment. Such studies are needed to define habitability (for life as we know it) and to support space exploration and the search for life beyond our planet. This includes continued protection of humans in space, as well as protecting the Earth, other planets and moons as human space exploration progresses.Despite the broad range of physically and chemically extreme environments naturally present on Earth, some extraterrestrial conditions are specific to space, planetary, or planetary satellite environments. These conditions include low pressure down to space vacuum, exceptionally low relative humidity, micro- and fractional gravities, or parameters that may mimic the early Earth environment (anoxic, high radiation, warmer temperatures). Moreover, the Earth’s present magnetic field and atmosphere attenuate the far higher doses of ionizing and short-wavelength solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that exist in space or on the surfaces of some other solar system bodies. It is possible to mimic single components of space radiation on Earth, but, due to its complexity, the radiation field in space can only partly be simulated25,26. Access to space environments is necessary in order to perform in situ exposure of organisms and their component macromolecules (nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, etc.). This allows for the measurement of space-radiation-induced metabolic, genetic, and phenotypic changes, as well as the survival of, or damage to, key biomolecules. When investigating the constraints of life beyond Earth, such space-based experiments are critical in identifying individual or combined physically extreme parameters, that cannot be found or simulated on Earth.Terrestrial organisms typically form groups and communities that provide advantages for survival and adaptation to environmental conditions. Single organisms may not be able to cope with extreme environmental parameters; however, biological interactions may provide collective protection, thus protecting many individuals. Adaptation to large environmental changes on a planetary scale (such as those that occurred on Mars27) may be mitigated on the micro-scale in environmental niches by associations of organisms of either the same or different species (dual/multi-species biofilms, symbionts, ecosystems23,28,29), and their interactions with abiotic material (rock/regolith layers, etc.). Investigating survival and adaptation strategies based on community formation and symbiotic relationships is important to understanding the limits of habitability.As there is an increasing number of organisms being discovered and described that show adaptations to extreme environments30,31, it is essential to determine if these novel extremophiles imply that life could be distributed (either naturally or artificially) through the Solar System. There is a possibility that organisms could travel to and survive within interplanetary meteorites (e.g., those ejected from Mars to Earth); the mineral protection and preservation of organisms or biomolecules under these relevant environments is important. In addition to the natural distribution of life in the Solar System, we must assume that space exploration could result in forward contamination of solar system bodies by terrestrial material. This further underlines the need for Earth orbit and space-based in situ experiments, focusing on the survival strategies of organisms and their means of adaptation to environmental parameters not found on Earth. Knowledge of these survival strategies and the limits of extremophilic organisms will lead to further developments and improvements of decontamination procedures in a context of planetary protection. Currently, such decontamination procedures are the only way to minimize the risk of contamination of other worlds with terrestrial life. This is of particular importance for destinations that are considered habitable and may have (developed) their own biota. The investigation of viable spacecraft microbiota (both external and internal) will support more targeted, destination-dependent planetary protection measures. The potential impact and likelihood of forward biocontamination by both robotic and human missions must be considered very carefully, both at the technical and operational level, particularly assessing their compatibility with life-detection missions.The signs of life—topic CTo understand the signs of life (biosignatures) in and beyond our solar system, we must focus on cells, their remnants, clearly cell-related biochemical molecules, as well as biomediated structures. In addition, studying environmental transformations (including potential bio-driven transformations of atmospheric composition) should be an important objective. This topic focuses on detecting signs of life using a suite of complementary instruments, on the characterization of distinct cellular components and the stability of these biomolecules, as well as any specific physical evidence of interaction of cells with their environment. This is particularly relevant for in situ missions searching for evidence of life, as well as for analysis of returned extraterrestrial samples.The search for signs of extinct life (either biomineralized or fossilized) relies on detecting organic, geochemical, isotopic or morphological remnants or other biomediated phenomena, such as biolaminae or stromatolitic bioconstructions32, at, or within planetary subsurfaces or ices. A better understanding of the process of fossilization and how extant biosignatures are preserved over geological time is required33. A relevant example of this is the search for past life on Mars. UV radiation interactions with organic remnants under different atmospheres, temperatures, pressures, and humidities needs to be investigated using references, such as terrestrial fossils from Earth. This can be performed under simulated conditions (planetary-simulation facilities34), however space-exposure facilities provide access to environmental parameters not available on Earth, such as microgravity, full-spectrum solar and cosmic radiation. Such experiments can provide insights into early-Earth conditions similar to those expected on rocky planets (such as Mars or Venus) or exoplanets.Looking beyond our solar system, the simulation of potential exoplanetary conditions is crucial to decoding spectral signatures and therefore to understanding and interpreting their formation and evolution. Space-based experiments are of particular importance when assessing the impact of the solar spectrum and cosmic rays on biological compounds and organisms as fully representative photon and particle spectra cannot be reproduced in the laboratory. As molecules produced by life forms might not be unambiguously identified, this is a particular challenge for remote detection in (exo)planetary atmospheres or surfaces. Therefore, it is paramount to understand transformational processes and biochemical pathways of biosignatures, especially those that can be detected as volatile organic compounds or gaseous biosignatures in a planetary atmosphere. Also, with the various types, ages and sizes of stars, different planets receive different stellar spectra of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, to identify signals of potential pigmented life forms on exoplanets, potential biochemical pathways of ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorbing complex organic molecules synthesized in response to spectra different than that of the Sun should be investigated.In the search for extant life, it is important to analyze biomolecules that can serve as cellular constituents. These include amino acids, peptides, lipids, pigments, and carbohydrates. Additional biomolecules of importance are those known from Earth organisms such as sterols, quinones, and porphyrins, as well as polymeric biomolecules that can store and transfer information, e.g., genetic material and proteins. With the assumption that non-Earth life is similar to life as we know it (i.e., based on carbon-bearing molecules with water as a solvent), it is possible to characterize cellular life cycles based on the presence, amount, or change over time of potential biomarker molecules on a planetary surface or atmosphere. In addition to environmental processes influencing biomarker molecules, the converse may also be true, with cellular processes having the potential to influence their surroundings. Such a reciprocal influence must be accounted for when classifying biosignatures or identifying extant life in a space or planetary environment.A systematic approach for the detection of microbial life forms can be based in part upon the collection of data from the known microbial world. Environmental parameters and the geological evolution of potential host planets or planetary bodies should determine their viability as search targets. For instance, life-detection missions to Mars and to the moons Europa and Enceladus will include means to seek signatures of microorganisms similar to terrestrial life forms with metabolisms that could have been present on early Earth (including chemotrophs/anoxygenic photosynthesizers/certain heterotrophs35). Similar evidence-based considerations are needed to tailor missions to other bodies in our solar system. Furthermore, studies are needed to understand the relationship between the signs of life and various environmental conditions present at planetary-analog field sites, during planetary-simulation experiments, as well as in space. Each of these environmental parameters could alter or hide biosignatures, or produce false positives, such a minerals or organomineral structures that imitate the relatively simple morphology of microorganisms. These approaches should not only account for biosignatures derived from “life as we know it” but should also include agnostic biosignatures, i.e., signs of chemical or geological disequilibrium. As such, a variety of detection instruments and analytical techniques should be utilized to systematically add to existing databases such as NASA’s Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database. The integration and synchronization of centralized spaceflight experimental data repositories is a necessity in the future."

Microbial-based biotechnologies and biomanufacturing approaches have demonstrated their high efficacy in several applications and may become a key component of future ISRU strategies (Brown et al.2008; Slenzka and Kempf2010; Montague et al.2012; Verseux et al.2016; Nangle et al.2020; Volponi and Lasseur2020; Berliner et al.2021; Castelein et al.2021; Keller et al.2021).

Water, oxygen, volatiles, essential nutrients for human nutrition and soil fertilization, are all elements which will be essential to establish self-sufficient settlements, and that could be obtained from extraterrestrial rocks (Cockell2011). Mining of these resources will therefore be a priority for an extraterrestrial settlement.Microorganisms can be applied to these needs, extracting useful elements by a technique called biomining or bioleaching. Currently on Earth around 20–25% of copper and 5% of gold are extracted using biomining (Johnson et al.2013). Bioleaching can provide economic and environmental advantages compared to other methods (Srichandan et al.2019) and can be used as a complementary technique to extract trace metals from mine waste, or recover low-grade ores which cannot be treated by conventional methods (Bosecker1997). Mining processes produce an enormous amount of waste low-grade rock material and mill tailings, which often still contain useful trace elements that cannot be further recovered by traditional methods. However, these can be accessible to small microbial cells, as an effect of specific types of metabolism (Blowes et al.2003; Schippers et al.2013; Johnson2014; Jerez2017a). With the same principle, bioleaching techniques can be applied to the recycling of useful metals from secondary solid waste (Schippers et al.2013; Johnson2014; Jerez2017b). A good example is provided by the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs, Reed et al.2016) or copper from electronic waste (Srichandan et al.2019).Many advantages of biomining over traditional techniques on Earth also apply to space. For instance, biomining generally requires lower energy compared to traditional mining (Schippers et al.2013), which will be an advantage in space, where resources are limited and many engineering constraints may be in place. Nevertheless, space conditions and available rock materials are different from those present on Earth and which are commonly used in terrestrial biomining. On one hand, traditional autotrophic and chemolithotrophic microbes used for terrestrial biomining do not need to rely on organic compounds as nutrients, which are very scarce in extraterrestrial environments, to grow (Johansson1992; Fahrion et al.2021). On the other hand, rocks present on celestial bodies of mining interest have very diverse compositions. In some cases (e.g., the Moon and some asteroids) sulphide-containing minerals are scarce compared to ore-grade sulphide minerals which are the focus of terrestrial biomining (Lewis1992; Anand et al.2012; Righter et al.2017; Steenstra et al.2018,2020; Brounce et al.2019,2020).

An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three\nEscherichia coli\nstrains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.\nKeywords:\nclinostat, minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, rpoS, cell size, aggregation, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, urinary tract infection, UTI, spaceflight",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionHumans carry roughly as many bacterial cells in and on our bodies as we have total mammalian cells [1]. By the nature of this, we will ubiquitously share space habitats with bacteria. Hence, it is important to understand how an altered gravitational environment may affect bacterial behavior and, in the context of human health concerns, the efficacy of antibiotics. Although no overarching definitive conclusions have yet been reached [2,3], many studies performed in space have shown altered bacterial behavior in microgravity with respect to 1 g on Earth [4], including modified cell and biofilm phenotype [5,6,7,8], increased virulence [9], and reduced bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics [7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].While these studies have interrogated bacterial behavior and its potential consequences for crew health in the microgravity environment of orbital flight, very little is known on these topics under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes, 1.62 m/s2(~⅙ g) and 3.72 m/s2(~⅜ g), respectively. Of particular interest are processes related to urinary tract infections (UTI) given that urosepsis (which can occur if a UTI is not treated properly) is the third most likely reason for emergent medical evacuation from the International Space Station (ISS) [23].Escherichia coliis the most commonly isolated UTI pathogen [24], and is also typically used as a bacterial model organism for spaceflight research [19]. As part of a NASA-funded study using ten microbes (results of other species to be published separately), this manuscript describes experiments focused on characterizing growth dynamics (lag phase duration, exponential growth rate, and final cell counts at stationary phase), phenotypic changes (cell diameter and length and aggregation), and the sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for threeE. colistrains cultured under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. Our methodology to simulate some aspects of these gravitational conditions—inclined clinostats and a code to determine an optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures—are also explained."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nwere grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.\nSubject terms:\nMicrobiology, Molecular biology, Aerospace engineering",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionIn previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial biofilms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018, 20201,2). On the ISS, biofilms are a concern for the water recovery system, particularly for the water processing assembly’s wastewater tank and its downstream filter3,4, as well as for the hoses linking the distillation assembly to the purge and fluid pumps, which have needed to be returned to Earth for unclogging and reprocessing before sent back to ISS (Y.A. Velez-Justiniano, personal communication, June 10, 2022).Biofilms are communities of microbes attached to each other and to surfaces which can cause damage to materials either directly by using it as food, or indirectly via their metabolic byproducts5,6. While pre-planned biofilms may enable useful processes in space7–9, uncontrolled growth—especially of opportunistic or pathogenic microbes—may have another deleterious effect for space missions: increased risk of infections to the crew. Microbial communities living as biofilms can have increased tolerance to disinfectants and antibiotics10, which may contribute to recurrent infections. On Earth, biofilms are associated with 65% and 80% of infectious and chronic diseases, respectively11.Materials can profoundly influence biofilm growth, and it is possible to design surfaces that either prevent microbial adhesion or that have antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial surfaces include those with metallic nanoparticles with biocidal effects12and strongly oxidizing materials that destroy cell membranes13. However, biocidal surfaces have a critical failure mechanism when a layer of destroyed cells forms on the initial surface. This layer can provide a safe harbor for new microbes to colonize. Preventing initial adhesion of microbes via engineering of surface properties addresses this limitation. Surface roughness provides initial colonizers with favorable positions to adhere to a surface, and therefore smooth surfaces tend to be more successful at preventing adhesion14. Hydrophobicity is another property that is particularly focused on in the context of creating adhesion-free surfaces; however, the influence is a complicated one. In general, hydrophobic surfaces may cause greater initial attachment due to hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the cell membranes, but also allow larger detachment rates14.The fast pace of microbial adaptation and changes in gene expression also presents a significant challenge for creation of anti-biofouling materials. Microorganism behavior is significantly altered by the presence of different surfaces. For example, biofilm morphologies differ strongly across steel and polypropylene surfaces15, and gene expression is altered for microbes exposed to less habitable surfaces16,17. Therefore, even surfaces engineered to resist biofilms may not be immune to bacteria colonization.Biofilm growth in space stations and surface habitat components can decrease the probability of mission success and increase that of medical risks to the crew. Crewed missions to the Lunar surface and Mars, the latter requiring several years in space, warrant understanding of how biofilms grow differently in microgravity, as system functionality is of even higher importance when receiving spare parts from Earth or returning crew to Earth promptly is not possible. To address this, the NASA-funded Space Biofilms project was designed as described in Zea et al. 20181, and prepared and performed on board the ISS as reported in Flores et al., 202218. In brief, samples ofPseudomonas aeruginosaUCBPP-PA14 (PA14) were sent to the ISS and biofilms were allowed to grow on different surfaces for either one, two, or three days at 37 °C. Equivalent biofilms grown on Earth at 1gwere used as controls. The six material surfaces tested were stainless steel 316 (SS316), passivated SS316 (pSS316), a silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil as a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS)19, cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone with a microtopography. Each condition tested had four replicates fixed in 4% PFA for morphology analysis, and other four preserved in RNAlater for gene expression analysis. Here, we report the morphological and transcriptomic results of SS316, pSS316, and LIS grown in nutrient-rich medium (to replicate wastewater); the rest are reported elsewhere20.SS316 and pSS316 were assessed given their common use for spacecraft components and for elements of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), respectively. LIS was tested as a potential alternative for future spacecraft parts most susceptible to biofilm formation.SS316 is an iron alloy containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum characteristic for its increased resistance to corrosion compared to iron21. The passivation of SS316 uses a nitric or citric acid treatment to eliminate iron from the surface and generate an oxide passive layer to prevent corrosion22. LISs are a class of textured surfaces that are stably impregnated with a lubricant (e.g., oils) to render the surface with super-slippery properties19,23(Fig.1). The lubricant is held within the texture by capillary and intermolecular forces. A drop on LIS can exist in one of twelve different thermodynamic states depending on the properties of the solid texture, lubricant, droplet, and environment. Stable impregnation of the lubricant requires the contact angle of the lubricant on solid surface to be below a critical value set by the texture parameters. For the case of stable LIS, the texture tops can remain exposed or covered by a thin van der Waals lubricant film depending on the spreading coefficient of the lubricant on the solid surface (in the presence of droplet phase). A detailed discussion of the thermodynamic states, stable impregnation criteria, and droplet mobility are provided in Smith et al. (2013)19. Because a significant portion of the surface texture can stay submerged in the lubricant (except for texture tops) for stable LIS, these surfaces can achieve significant reduction in adhesion and have been shown to have remarkable antifouling properties24–30.Fig. 1.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nA biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii\nin the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or\ncw15\nmutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.\nKeywords:\nalgae, space environment, genetic fitness, population genetics,\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMicroalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO2into biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support systems to recycle CO2and provide food either directly or indirectly to astronauts (Brechignac and Schiller, 1992;Ai et al., 2008;Niederwieser et al., 2018;Matula and Nabity, 2019). Many species of microalgae are photosynthetically efficient under the limiting light and low volume conditions necessary in space production (Kliphuis et al., 2012). As single cell organisms, microalgae are easy to cultivate with minimal requirements, and have great potential to yield value-added products.Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, such asChlorella vulgarisandArthrospira platensis, respectively, are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption (Caporgno and Mathys, 2018). Algae have nutritional benefits with high levels of antioxidants and protein with essential amino acids (Buono et al., 2014). Algae are also rich in ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Salem and Eggersdorfer, 2015). The red algal carotenoid, astaxanthin, has multiple uses including the ability to protect against retinal damage in animals (Wang et al., 2000;Katagiri et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2016;Otsuka et al., 2016;Shah et al., 2016). Algal oils may be used in future astronaut diets to help mitigate harmful effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation during spaceflight.Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiis a model organism for unicellular algae with a well-annotated genome sequence (Merchant et al., 2007). Although Chlamydomonas is not designated as a GRAS organism, feeding studies show no harmful effects of including significant amounts of algae biomass in animal feed (Baek et al., 2018;Murbach et al., 2018). Consequently, Chlamydomonas can be used as a model for other microalgae species, an animal feed for space food systems, or a feedstock for manufacturing.A few past studies exposed or grew algal species in space conditions (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989;Wang et al., 2006;Giardi et al., 2013;Niederwieser et al., 2018). A Space Shuttle mission in 1985 usedC. reinhardtiito examine phototaxic responses in microgravity (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989). Microgravity allowed cells to remain close to light sources in spaceflight suggesting that photosynthetic productivity could be higher in space. By contrast,Wang et al. (2006)grew cyanobacteria for 15 days in a satellite and found reduced growth relative to a ground control. However, the ground control temperature and light cycles were not adjusted to the space conditions. The satellite had two temperature drops and two missed day photoperiods preventing strong conclusions from being drawn about growth rates.Giardi et al. (2013)compared Chlamydomonas photosynthetic responses for wild-type and photosystem II (PSII) D1 mutants in stationary cultures. Spaceflight had a greater negative effect on PSII fluorescence in wild-type cells and negatively impacted cell growth upon return to Earth. Soviet and Russian spaceflight experiments indicate thatC. vulgarishas similar growth kinetics in space and on Earth, but the cells experience spaceflight as a stress (reviewed inNiederwieser et al., 2018).The impact of the spaceflight environment for larger scale production of algae is currently unknown. To test larger scale microalgae production, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed a photobioreactor that pumps liquid media through a meandering path, pipe-reactor (Bretschneider et al., 2016). Gas exchange is mediated by fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membranes that allow CO2and O2diffusion, while algae are continuously mixed with a peristaltic pump (Helisch et al., 2019). This photobioreactor is currently being tested on the International Space Station (ISS) for long-term growth ofC. vulgaris.A significant challenge of maintaining photosynthetic productivity is regular removal of stationary cells and addition of new media to maintain photoautotrophic growth without forming excessive biofilms within the raceway. In addition, this photobioreactor experiment is not focusing on understanding genes required for growth in spaceflight conditions (Helisch et al., 2019).In yeast, competitive growth experiments in liquid culture were used to identify genes needed for survival in spaceflight conditions (Nislow et al., 2015). We are completing spaceflight experiments to determine similar gene sets for Chlamydomonas via competitive growth of mutagenized cells. Here we report results from our development of methods and experiment verification test (EVT). We describe a simple batch culture protocol using commercial FEP tissue culture bags that is adapted to the Veggie plant growth chambers on the ISS. Shortwave ultraviolet (UVC) light mutagenesis and full genome sequencing enabled the detection of new mutations in two microalgae strains. The spectrum of mutations identified suggests that UVC primarily induces DNA damage in Chlamydomonas via errors in translesion synthesis and double strand break repair. In addition, a variety of cellular information processing functions may need to be modified to adapt Chlamydomonas to this batch culture system."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (\nLactuca sativa\ncv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (\nBrassica rapa\nvar\njaponica\n); and green leaf lettuce, (\nLactuca sativa\ncv.

Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick.

        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionFuture space missions and habitats will likely include crop production systems designed to provide a fresh, nutritious component to the crew diet. Understanding the complexities of plant growth systems designed with the unique challenges of space exploration missions and the associated plant microbiome is essential for sustaining the health of crop systems as well as the human consumer [1,2]. Molecular biology methods to characterize whole microbial communities through omics approaches have led to the understanding of organism and habitat-specific microbiomes. Plants and their associated microbiota exist in a complex association with important functions critical to plant growth and health. Microbes are recruited and assembled on or in plant tissues and organs from reservoirs such as the soil, rhizosphere, and phyllosphere [3,4,5,6]. Soil microbial communities are highly diverse and are horizontally transferred to the root where, at the rhizosphere, a dynamic and complex ecosystem develops [7,8,9,10,11,12]. Initial soil microbiome composition can influence plant pathogen interaction and disease resistance [13]. A plant’s phyllosphere hosts a diverse community of microbes that can also influence plant health and physiology [14,15,16,17]. Plant colonizing microorganisms are affected not only by abiotic environmental conditions such as CO2concentration, temperature, spectral radiation, and humidity, but specific host leaf surface characteristics [14,18,19]. Studies have shown inter-plant species variability in the phyllosphere microbiome [14,16,20] and microbial colonization of the phylloplane is dependent on transmission of organisms from the environment such as aerosols, soils or other plant growth medium, and animal contact [21,22,23,24]. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that plants can influence the microbiome of the indoor built environment significantly contributing to the bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity on the surrounding surfaces [23].The International Space Station (ISS) is an inimitable, closed environment that has been continuously inhabited by astronauts starting with Expedition 1 in November of 2000. Unlike terrestrial, built environments, the exchange of microbes from outside the ISS is infrequent and primarily limited to the exchange of international crews after months of residency on the space station, along with re-supply missions. Since 2014, plants, primarily leafy greens, have been grown in the NASA Veggie hardware which are small growth chambers on the ISS (ORBITEC now Sierra Space., Madison, WI, United States) [25,26]. Fifteen technology demonstrations directed by NASA to grow a variety of crops have been completed to date and currently there are two Veggie units (Serial number (SN) 001 and Serial number 002) in operation on ISS. The Veggie chambers (Figure 1) utilize a fan to circulate the air from outside of the chamber throughout the plant growth area facilitating an exchange of airborne microbes between the ISS atmosphere and the chamber interior. Air drawn from the ISS cabin flows from the bottom of the plant canopy to the top of the growth chamber volume. Air filtration is not present apart from screens to filter out large particles within the Veggie facility before entering the cabin [27]. Environmental conditions in which ISS grown crops have been cultivated are unlike terrestrial counterparts, in addition to an absence of gravity and natural convection. Carbon dioxide levels can reach approximately 7 to 10 times higher than ambient earth atmosphere in the closed atmosphere of the ISS, temperatures are typically between 18 °C and 23 °C and humidity is low (40–50%), however temperature and humidity can be higher inside the Veggie chamber. A collapsible, transparent bellows contains the plant growing area and any plant debris. During the on-orbit operation, the plant crops are tended, harvested, and consumed by the crew and are intended to provide a nutritional supplement to their diet. At the completion of a harvest, all plant growth containers, known as plant pillows, are discarded, or stored frozen for return to Earth and the bellows and other surfaces are cleaned with disinfectant wipes in preparation for the next crop.Figure 1.Open in a new tab(A) VEG-03D (SN 002) with ambient light and bellows down. (B) VEG-03E (SN 001) with bellows lowered and plant base plate raised to a more vertical position and VEG-03F (SN 002) partially visible on the right of VEG-03E with bellows raised.Microbial analyses using culture-based and culture-independent methods of Veggie-grown crops and growth chamber components have been completed to provide baseline data to ensure the microbiological safety for consumption by the astronauts. Subsequently, an in-depth characterization of bacterial and fungal communities associated with three crop grow-outs of red romaine lettuce that may impact astronaut and plant health has been reported [28].Plants grown in Veggie are susceptible to abiotic factors inherent in microgravity plant cultivation such as water stress and humidity control. Without careful control and monitoring, the environmental conditions within Veggie can promote undesirable levels of microbial growth.Zinnia hybrida, a flowering plant grown in Veggie in 2015–2016 became infected with the plant opportunistic pathogenFusarium oxysporumafter failure of the ventilation system led to an increase in humidity inside the chamber [29]. The source of the fungus was not determined definitively, howeverF. oxysporumhas been isolated on surfaces on the ISS [29,30,31,32,33]. Furthermore,F. oxysporumwas among the fungal isolates identified from leaves and roots from two out of three Veggie demonstrations growing red romaine lettuce [28]. The introduction of microbes from the air, water, or human interaction onto the plant surfaces of an edible crop potentially establishes a risk to the consumer. Crew safety and health is of paramount consideration when supplying a fresh food source through Veggie crop production and the characterization of the microbial communities in Veggie furthers the assurance that these crops are appropriate and safe for human consumption.The VEG-03D, E, and F series of technology demonstrations discussed in this work are the first mixed crop use of the Veggie facility with the growth of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativacv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapavarjaponica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativacv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’).In addition to the demonstration of a mixed cultivar approach and continuous harvest using two Veggie systems, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the bioburden and composition of the microbial communities within the Veggie plant growth units at different locations including above ground plant tissues, roots of 3 plant cultivars, Veggie facility surfaces, and plant pillow materials. We identified through culture- based and culture-independent methods dominant and shared genera of bacteria and fungi in plants, growth substrate, and Veggie facility surfaces. This study demonstrated simultaneous multi-species leafy green growth and the influence of the plant leaf and root associated microbial communities across plant species and Veggie growth chamber components."

        "Title": "Response of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard seeds to simulated space radiation exposures.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant\nArabidopsis thaliana\nand the crop plant Mizuna mustard [\nBrassica rapa var. japonica\n]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated\nArabidopsis\nseeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.\nKeywords:\nspace radiation, galactic cosmic rays, solar particle event,\nArabidopsis\n, mizuna mustard, seeds",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionA long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply. Consequently, food may have to be sent years ahead of the crew. Shelf-stable food systems may be five years old by the end of the mission. Under expected ambient storage conditions, critical nutrients and quality factors may degrade over this period of time [1,2]. This possibility creates a critical risk to the provision of adequate food and nutrition to support crew health and performance through such missions. Food crops grown in-mission have the potential to supplement crew nutritional requirements and to act as a psychological countermeasure for the crew by providing a familiar aspect of Earth in the isolation and confinement of deep space [3]. However, seeds and plant growth supplies may also have to be sent ahead of the crew and would need to remain viable for the length of the mission. Deep-space radiation is one of the major factors that could impact the viability of food crops.Deep-space radiation is composed primarily of protons released from large solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). GCR consists of approximately 85–90% protons, and 10–13% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1–2% consisting of high atomic number and energy (HZE) nuclei particles and electrons [4]. For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, astronauts and other organisms onboard these deep space missions will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to protons from SPEs. Life on Earth is well protected from these components of deep-space radiation for two reasons: (1) the Earth’s global magnetic field deflects energetic charged particles, and (2) Earth’s atmosphere interacts with them resulting in attenuated energy levels and secondary particles [5]. However, during a mission beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), living organisms will be exposed to more intense deep-space radiation, in addition to secondary particles generated by the shielding materials, the atmosphere, and regolith if near the Lunar or Martian surface.During a long-term deep space mission, it is expected that crew members in space will be exposed to 1–2 mSv/day dose equivalent rate of GCR and approximately half this amount on planetary surfaces [6,7,8]. Even though the flux levels of GCR particles are very low, GCR contains high linear energy transfer (LET) particles that produce intense ionization as they penetrate through matter. Compared to low LET radiation (e.g., gamma radiation), the estimated average biological effectiveness (or the quality factor) of radiation received on the Martian surface and during transit are 3.05 and 3.82, respectively, primarily due to the Martian atmosphere [6,7,8]. The effective Mars atmospheric shielding is about 21 g/cm2, which is much thicker than the spacecraft shielding of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)’s Curiosity Rover during its transportation from Earth to Mars [7,8]. For Lunar missions, there is no atmospheric shielding effect. Using data obtained during the MSL mission, it was estimated that a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 Sv would be experienced during a round trip Mars surface mission consisting of a 180-day transit (each way) and 500 days on the Martian surface with solar activity similar to that of 2011–2012 [7,8]. For plant seeds, these dose equivalent rates and quality factors may not be applicable because they refer to the biological effectiveness of a given absorbed dose of a specific type of radiation based on human tissue responses. Therefore, in this study, we designed the experiment based on the measurements of the absorbed dose during the MSL mission, which is 400–560 µGy/day during transit and 170–250 µGy/day on the Martian surface at the Gale crater region [7,8].At the cellular level, radiation induces DNA damage, which to some extent is successfully handled by cellular repair machinery. To counteract DNA damage, a network of cellular pathways, defined as the DNA damage response (DDR) network, mitigates DNA damage by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The basic DDR networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, but significant differences exist in the radiosensitivity among different species and the mechanisms that allow access to the lesions by repair enzymes [9]. Plants share many features of chromatin organization and DNA repair with fungi and animals [9,10].Numerous studies have shown that the effect of ionizing radiation on plants depends upon species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [11]. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and on other venues beyond LEO [12,13,14], however, the radiation environment reported in most of these published studies is not comparable to deep- space radiation, neither in quality nor quantity. Therefore, whether crop seeds, plant growth, and produce quality are significantly affected by long-term exposure to deep-space radiation has yet to be adequately investigated and characterized.Although current Earth-based radiation facilities can only approximately reproduce the space-radiation environment, recent improvements in technology can be utilized to improve our knowledge about the effect of space radiation on crop plants [15]. This information would in turn address the question of whether fresh food production could provide an important nutritional and psychological contribution on long-duration missions. In this study, two types of plant seeds were included. The first were seeds fromArabidopsis thaliana,a model organism that does not have properties that would contribute to a bioregenerative or food capability, but which is currently the most extensively studied plant in spaceflight [16] partially due to the availability of its whole genome sequence and a wide range of genetically modified strains. The second were seeds from an edible mustard plant, Mizuna,Brassica rapa var. japonica, which has been identified as a candidate space crop and grown for research and crew consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) [17,18,19,20]. Seeds from both species were irradiated, and subsequently planted and grown to seedlings to demonstrate the impact of the space radiation environment on seeds and their ability to germinate and develop. The range of outcomes betweenArabidopsisand Mizuna indicates the potential challenges with transferring model organism information to usable systems, and a need to focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions."

        "Introduction": "IntroductionHistorical background of the gowanus canalThe Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, NY, USA is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site (Miller2015) which contains significant amounts of chemicals of concern (Mandigo et al.2016). These include heavy metals like arsenic, copper, lead, and iron; halogenated compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB); chlorinated solvents and fungicides, including carbon tetrachloride and ethylene dibromide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); volatile organic compounds (VOC) and semivolatile organic compounds; petroleum products; and dissolved salts, including brine and other acids such as tartaric acid (U.S. EPA2011). Following the 2010 designation of the canal as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List, plans were announced to dredge and sub-aquatically cap the waterway over a decade (U.S. EPA2012) in a multiphase project expected to finish in mid-2025 (Krisel2015).Microbial response to anthropogenic contaminationThe Gowanus Canal is an extreme environment with both built and natural components in the most populated city in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau2025), and provides a testbed for studying the impact of engineered environments on resident ecosystems. Studies have shown that microorganisms, especially extremophiles, respond to the challenge of anthropogenic contaminants through adaptive degradation and biosorption (Xu et al.2010, Ghosh and Das2018, McCutcheon et al.2021, Sharma et al.2021). One such example includes the rapid shifts in marine microbial population observed after the DeepWater Horizon Spill both in open ocean (Mason et al.2012, Redmond and Valentine2012, Kimes et al.2014) and coastal wetlands (King et al.2015), where the relative abundance of petrochemical-degrading species increased significantly after the spill. In addition to natural adaptation of endogenous species, microbial remediation can occur by introducing target species to an environment. For example, introduction of a consortium consisting of probiotic bacteria efficient in degrading naturally occurring petroleum hydrocarbons to coral environments was shown to be effective in remediating oil spills without negatively impacting the coral holobiont, unlike using chemical dispersants (Fragoso ados Santos et al.2015). A two-stage fungal remediation study to tackle textile industry dye effluent utilizing both adsorption and accumulation illustrated the potential of integrated approaches in bioremediation (Mathur et al.2018). Microbial bioremediation, while presenting constraints of efficacy and scale, can be considered preferable over physico-chemical remediation as it does not leave further residues (Das and Dash2014).Superfund sites, with their high concentrations of toxic compounds, can be considered an extreme environment and extremophiles are known for their potential for bioremediation (Kaushik et al.2021). While every Superfund site is unique in its composition of contaminants, a growing body of literature has shown that microbial bioremediation often develops spontaneously. While microbial diversity can be decreased at a toxic site, the abundance of bioremediation-related species increases (Lowe et al.2002) with specific functions such as the microbial dechlorination of compounds, including PCBs (Rodenburg et al.2015). Microbial bioremediation is a long standing practice (Antizar-Ladislao2010), and more recently sequencing technologies and metagenomic analyses have enabled the identification of genes and species responsible for observed remediation-related metabolisms (Dangi et al.2019, Gupta et al.2020). These observations, in addition to the accelerated evolution of microbial communities in extreme environments (Li et al.2014), make Superfund sites candidates for metabolism mining—both with respect to contaminant-related functions, such as metal rare earth element binding, and also for discovery of novel functions or metabolites of potential biotechnological interest. Indeed, microorganisms in the environment can produce a wealth of secondary metabolites (SMs) which have been historically used for various biotechnological applications, including production of antibiotics, anticancer agents, and agrochemicals (Katz and Baltz2016). SMs synthesized through the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be hard to identify using bioactivity screens as BGCs are often silent, only activated under pleiotropic environmental triggers such as growth condition variation or introduction of competing species (Rutledge and Challis2015). Genome mining using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been used to identify BGCs responsible for encoding these SMs without the need for identifying the appropriate activation triggers (Udwary et al.2021). In particular, environmental microbiomes, even urban ones, can be a rich substrate for the discovery of such molecules (Charlop-Powers et al.2016). Given the Gowanus Canal’s unique—and extreme—environment, we hypothesize that its microbiome might be a source of novel BGCs.To provide a detailed molecular portrait of the microbial adaptations in the Canal, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and a suite of bioinformatic tools with the goals to (i) characterize species diversity, (ii) assess potential for bioremediation, and (iii) discover novel BGCs. As a community that has thrived in a highly contaminated environment for over a century and a half, this microbiome may hold keys for living and thriving under uniquely toxic selection pressures as particular to the putative Anthropocene era (Waters and Turner2022)."

Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOrgans-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4Although significant innovations have been made toward recreating organ-specific physiology on chip, the methods available to study the structure and function of the cell microenvironment are still limited.5–7Established analysis approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, often rely on laborious offline workflows that yield acute or terminal time-point data.8,9These complex techniques require substantial manual perturbations, frequently adding environmental and user-based variability to inherently inconsistent biological samples. As the OOC field continues to evolve, there is a unique opportunity to engineer improvedin situcharacterization methods into organ-chip devices. It is essential to develop novel approaches that address current limitations and enable real-time readout of relevant physiological parameters in OOCs to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems.Electrochemical and optical methods are the most common approaches for integrated sensing on-chip. Numerous demonstrations of electrochemical sensors have been integrated into OOC, showing high sensitivity and specificity for a range of analytes, including pH, oxygen concentration, glucose, and lactate.10–14Electrochemical methods have also been adapted for structural characterization of the microenvironment, tracking transient changes in barrier permeability, cell health, and differentiation state throughout culture on-chip.15–17Van der Helmet al.integrated plated electrodes on-chip for impedance spectroscopy measurements of Caco-2 monolayers differentiated on-chip.17Although electrochemical methods offer continuous, real-time data from the on-chip microenvironment, these approaches suffer from high costs resulting from complicated fabrication workflows for sensor integration and relatively rapid sensor fouling or site saturation.5,18Broad adoption of OOCs will require inexpensive consumable culture ware paired with reusable sensor technologies.Optical interrogation methods have been the standard for characterizing the on-chip microenvironment, enabling direct visualization of cell structure and quantitative outputs, including viability and protein expression.7,19,20Optical and fluorescence microscopy techniques offer non-invasive and non-destructive characterization of cellular dynamics on-chip, including oxygen consumption, calcium signalling, and barrier permeability.21–24In a multi-organ chip system, Novaket al.tracked the distribution of inulin-FITC tracer dye with an automated fluorescence microscopy platform, demonstrating repeatable concentration profiles for each of eight organ models over 3 weeks.21However, most experimental procedures are limited to single OOC setups and require human intervention for timepoint data collection. These requirements limit utility in drug development where high throughput is needed or requires expensive, high-content imaging systems.5,9Recent work has attempted to address this issue by automating organ-chip handling or miniaturizing optical components for direct integration.18,21Integrated sensing approaches are an attractive option for non-invasive characterization, combining the benefit of direct optical sensing with continuous, automated outputs.18,25,26Despite the advantages of fully integrated optical sensing, most approaches are not amenable to on-chip integration due to the bulky equipment required for directing beam paths or the complexity of the organ-chip system used.We sought to develop a fiber optic-based sensing system to enable fully integrated on-chip sensing, isolating optical components from the sample of interest by transmitting signals across fiber optic cables. Optical cables allowing for bidirectional light transmission are coupled to high-powered LEDs, simultaneously delivering excitation and recording emitted wavelengths to a CMOS camera or photomultiplier tube. The system collects signal as an aggregate sum of luminescence from the excited area, significantly increasing the signal-to-noise ratio but sacrificing single-cell resolution. Our technology presents the unique opportunity to integrate optical fibers on-chip forin situcharacterization of the cellular microenvironment using luminescent probes. We are the first to translate this technology to OOCs forin situoptical sensing. While other attempts have been made to enable real-time, fiber-optic-based fluorescence sensing in an organ chip, these approaches are limited to readout of oxygen concentration and pH only, using commercial systems with limited spectral range.25,26To our knowledge, our fiber-based system is the first to enable real-time, spatiotemporal sensing across the visible luminescence spectrum in OOCs.Physiological barriers, for example, the intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium, selectively regulate the flux of water, ions, and nutrients while preventing the passage of bacteria and pathogens.15,27Disruption of barrier functionin vivoleads to uninhibited, non-selective transport across the barrier and is associated with the pathophysiology of human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.28In OOC systems, barrier function is commonly assessed using trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values.29–31TEER is traditionally measured using an applied alternating current across a monolayer to determine the total ohmic resistance. Although TEER is a convenient method for characterizing barrier function on-chip, the current density applied across the barrier is dependent on electrode spatial configuration. Unequal distribution of current density across the barrier can lead to an over or underestimation of the actual TEER value. Further, with OOC platforms varying in size, shape, and orientation, it is difficult to translate measured values across systems without significant computational effort.17Here, we report a novel optical sensing platform for automated, non-invasive sensing of barrier function in OOCs under baseline and perturbed conditions. Specifically, we validated our photometry-based platform by monitoring epithelial and endothelial cell responses to induced inflammation on-chip. This is the first report on applying photometry-based technology to OOC, offering a novel approach to study the on-chip environment in real-time, expanding on the current capabilities of optical microscopy and end-point analyses."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nExposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1\ng\nground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionUnderstanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an important area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight activities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in future deep space exploration of the Moon and Mars. Our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. Rigorously investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control and replicate those experiments.As a result, reports of spaceflight effects on bone vary; findings range from increases in mandibular bone volume to both significant and nonsignificant changes in tibial trabeculae and various cortical sites [1–8]. Similarly, meta-analyses of spaceflight bone loss across species show variable site-specificity and magnitudes [9,10] of bone structural parameters. The NASA Rodent Research validation mission (RR-1) introduced the NASA RH as an ISS National Lab facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies (Fig 1A). Importantly for experiment design, animals can also be euthanized and dissected on orbit, avoiding potential concerns about hypergravity exposure during spacecraft reentry in live animal return experiments. The RR-1 experiment included ground-based controls in the RH, baseline controls to account for effects of aging over the 37-day study, and vivarium controls to reference results to standard vivarium cage mouse housing [11,12] (Fig 1B). In our investigation of RR-1 bone tissue samples, we focused on the hindlimb and the spine to compare sites of the skeleton predominantly loaded by weight-bearing and muscle activity, respectively (Fig 1C). The experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation, that occur between 16 and 21 weeks of age, prior to onset of femoral growth plate closure and secondary endochondral ossification (SEO) [13].Fig 1. (A) Image of the RH used in the ground control and spaceflight conditions (credit Dominic Hart, NASA).Open in a new tab(B) Each experimental condition of the NASA RR-1 study showing the biologically relevant independent variables examined. Adapted from Choi, et al. [11]. (C) Representative studied sites of μCT analysis with type of bone and the thickness of the selected VOI.A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight-bearing role in the mouse. Cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffolding during cortical bone growth [14], and are normally atrophied with aging [15,16] post skeletal maturation. Similarly to aging, spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of trabeculae in rodents and humans [17,18] and increases fracture risk in long bones [19]. As a primary weight-bearing center in the mouse skeleton [20], the femoral head is an important study site to understand the effects of disuse on skeletal health. Opposite the femoral head, the distal epiphysis of the femur is another site of SEO and direct loading [21] by the torsional stress of keeping the hip joint and ankle aligned [22,23]. Unlike cancellous bone, the comparably low surface area to volume ratio of cortical bone makes it more resilient to bone resorption during spaceflight [18]. Finally, the femoral neck is the thinnest cortical region in this bone, and as such, it is the site of most hip fractures in elderly patients [24], making it another important analysis site for our study. For contrast to the predominantly weight-bearing femur, we also analyzed the L2 vertebra in RR-1 mice. In bipedal humans, the spine is primarily loaded by the weight of the upper body. In quadrupedal rodents, however, the L2 vertebra is thought to be loaded mainly through the articulation of the thorax and abdomen via the lumbar and abdominal muscles, rather than serving a weight-bearing role.Thus, we hypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site-specific phenomenon associated with mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton, rather than other systemic factors. Using standard methodology for the quantification of bone parameters with histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) [25], within the regions of interest described inFig 1C, we conducted global and same-animal paired comparisons of bone parameters in the femur and L2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss in LEO is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites and not due to systemic effects."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.\nKeywords:\ninflammasome, inflammation, RR-1, space biology, International Space Station, innate immunity, inflammation",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpace flight exposes astronauts to a variety of stressors [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] ranging from psychological to physical that stem from the environment they experience [9]. These environmental factors include gravity changes, radiation exposure, altered nutrition or altered circadian rhythms, all of which affect the immune response [10,11,12,13,14]. Dysregulation of the immune response has two-fold consequences for astronauts. First, it has the potential to jeopardize the mission while in space, and it causes long-term detrimental consequences [8,15,16], not just while they are in space, but also once they return to Earth [8,17,18,19]. Therefore, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of how the immune response is altered by space flight.Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes comprising a sensor molecule such as NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and the cysteine aspartase caspase-1 [20]. The inflammasome plays a significant role in the regulation of the inflammatory response [21,22,23,24,25] by modulating the innate immune response through the activation of caspase-1, the processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, as well as the programmed cell death mechanism of pyroptosis [26]. The inflammasome has been shown to contribute to a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis [27,28,29,30,31], Parkinson’s disease [32,33], Alzheimer’s disease [34,35], inflammaging [36,37] and metabolic syndrome [38,39]. Several of these diseases, with an inflammasome etiology, have also been suggested to be relevant in the context of space flight such as the development of dementia [40], altered aging and inflammation [41] or diabetes [42]. Hence, it is important to understand the effects of space flight on inflammasome signaling to develop therapies against specific targets of the immune response to protect and improve the performance of astronauts not only during a mission, but also their health on Earth [43,44].It has been shown that space radiation affects hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks [45], spatial navigation and episodic memory formation [46,47], which is very important for the overall health of astronauts [43,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. In addition, it has been suggested that space radiation affects the cortex and causes altered cognitive flexibility and synaptic plasticity, which contribute to cognitive deficits [58]. A recent study used the anti-oxidant LGM2605 to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in an in vitro model of lung vascular networks that were exposed to γ-rays and mixed-field radiation sources to mimic some of the space flight conditions in vitro [59]. The study found that 3–4 keV/µm and 8–10 keV/µm linear energy transfer (LET) proton radiation elevated the levels of NLRP3, and that this increase can be targeted with anti-oxidant approaches [59]. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effect of space flight on the expression of inflammasome proteins and inflammatory cytokines in mice that were part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission (RR-1) on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft that spent 37 to 38 days at the International Space Station (ISS)."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpace travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12864-025-11426-y.\nKeywords:\nSpaceflight, Microgravity, International space station, Transcriptomics, NF-κB, Immunization, Myocarditis, Inflammation, Heart, Cardiovascular system",

        "Title": "Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.\nSubject terms:\nBiotechnology, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Biomarkers, Risk factors",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionRodent studies demonstrate that spaceflight negatively impacts liver function1–3. Astronaut studies including the seminal NASA Twins Study also reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation4,5. Despite these findings, there has been relatively little research studying the impact of microgravity or space radiation on the liver, with more research emphasis on central nervous system effects and carcinogenesis. This is a key knowledge gap considering the disruption of such a critical organ could impact astronaut health and jeopardize the success of future long-term space missions. Identifying the genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction is required as a first step in precisely mitigating those deleterious effects. Traditional statistical methods identify correlations which may or may not be spurious, especially in high-dimensional, high-throughput data analysis6. While randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for identifying non-spurious, causal relationships between dependent and independent variables7, such experiments can be very expensive and time consuming, or logistically infeasible, especially in a spaceflight environment where sample sizes are limited. Instead, we turn to new machine learning (ML) approaches to identify genes in transcriptomic data predictive of a lipid metabolic response from spaceflight and ground control rodent liver samples.Tools which are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional data, and ML algorithms in general, share an intrinsic flaw. They discover those patterns in data which minimize training error, but training data are often flawed by selection bias, label bias, capture bias, and negative set bias8. Algorithms which train on biased datasets inherit these data biases. Minimizing training error encourages algorithms to indiscriminately absorb all the correlations found in training data, real or spurious. Spurious correlations resulting from data biases are unrelated to the true underlying signal9. Recently, disambiguating true correlations from spurious ones has been studied in the context of causal inference. For this reason, we leverage tools from the causal inference domain to identify genes which are robustly correlated with a phenotype. While such genes are putatively causal, validating true causality is beyond the scope of this research. In this research, we use CRISP—an ensemble machine learning platform developed by the Frontier Development Laboratory (FDL) 2020 Astronaut Health team10to enhance biological and medical research with heterogeneous and high-dimensional observational data11. The FDL team used CRISP to identify genetic drivers that differentiate two subtypes of colorectal cancer and to implicate operational taxonomic units of the associated microbiome.The algorithms in the CRISP platform are based on the concept of invariance as a proxy for causal inference. Invariance is a property of a feature which reflects how well a classification algorithm performs using that feature to predict a response invariantly; that is, on data which were generated in different environments, under different circumstances, different conditions, or using different interventions12,13. An algorithm based on invariance can identify those features that predict the target label regardless of the background data generating processes that gave rise to the dataset. The classic example is a machine learning classifier built to distinguish images of cows from images of camels14. A machine learning classifier that is overfit to a particular environment may learn that a cow is an animal that lives in green pastures while a camel is an animal that lives in beige deserts. Given a cow on a sandy beach, this classifier would likely call it a camel. By contrast, a classifier based on invariance would be optimized to ignore the background environment and learn the salient features which truly distinguish a cow from a camel, such as the dimensions of the neck and legs and the shape of the face. Classification algorithms which exploit invariance promote learning correlations that are stable across training environments, as these are expected to persist on out-of-distribution data (i.e. data generated in environments not seen by the algorithm during training) and therefore be robustly correlated to and more likely causal of the response variable15.In this research, we leverage several data transformations for augmenting the dataset that additionally provide an environment in which to leverage the CRISP invariance strategy. We use CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a high lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice liver tissue. We establish a binary threshold of lipid density using scalar values associated with oil red O (ORO) stained tissue. To compare our method with traditional differential gene expression tools, we use EdgeR and DESeq2. We also compare our results with those derived from generic machine learning classifiers including random forest and empirical risk minimization. Overall, we find that CRISP identifies a biologically relevant set of genes which are uniquely predictive of a high lipid density response in space-flown mice. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses reveal that the dysfunctional regulation of the genes identified by CRISP is implicated in the spectrum of diseases caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mice in the experiment flight group were only in space for a maximum of 54 days, yet their gene expression profiles were altered significantly enough to manifest markers of NAFLD. NASA has gathered a significant amount of biomedical data on the effect of short-term spaceflight (< 6 months), from the astronauts of the Apollo missions to those who fly on the International Space Station (ISS). What matters now is not merely the impact of being in space, but rather the impact of living there. Surviving long-term spaceflight (> 6 months) is necessary for the success of the planned Artemis and Mars missions16. Our study provides the first machine learning analysis of gene expression predictive of a disease-related response to spaceflight in the liver."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMen and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (\nn\n= 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (\nn\n= 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (\nn\n= 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity.\nSubject terms:\nPhysiology, Translational research",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts both during and after spaceflight are variable in terms of sex, duration of exposure, and the model used for the studies. Men and women have different recovery mechanisms from stress factors, which can influence the response to the spaceflight environment1. Though women are known to be protected against heart disease prior to menopause, responses of the vascular system to spaceflight are complicated by additional stress factors including microgravity, space radiation, inactivity, or isolation. Few studies have focused on the sex differences in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceflight in spite of the fact that the proportion of women participating in space missions has reached about 10% and continues to increase2. The empirically reported effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are varied across people who have been in space3. Some common short-term physiological effects of spaceflight include changes in blood volume distribution and alterations in baroreflex function3. Prolonged exposure to spaceflight also impacts cardiovascular system including red blood cell count, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, and cardiac output4–7. Sex-based differences in cardiovascular responses have been reported with changes in both sexes occurring after several weeks in space1,8. Female astronauts experience a greater loss of plasma volume while male astronauts appear to be more prone to develop a spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)9–11. Furthermore, following a 6-month spaceflight, women tended to have greater increases in plasma renin and aldosterone versus men, while both men and women experienced increased carotid artery stiffness5. The observed sex differences underscore the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular changes and sex-specific adaptations to both terrestrial and space-induced stressors important for the development of personalized preventative countermeasures for astronauts. To better understand the changes in cardiovascular adaptations in response to spaceflight environment, terrestrial studies are focused on recapitulating microgravity in human subjects with head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest or in rodent models with hindlimb unloading (HLU)12,13. The mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular system responses and arterial stiffness are not well understood particularly in the female subjects. Furthermore, the majority of HLU studies use male rodent subjects, with even fewer examining differences between sexes. Therefore, the present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the development of central arterial stiffness in female and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats in response to HLU as an analog for spaceflight-induced microgravity."

Supporting distant and long-duration missions is our new paradigm that requires biological and health-related data to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) (5,6). Optimal data governance for public dissemination encompasses a spectrum from closed to mediated, embargoed and fully open access. Scientific reproducibility, knowledge discovery and data reuse is maximized when data are both FAIR and open (7).For the past decade, NASA GeneLab ‘omics database has played the leading role in collecting, curating, processing and organizing space biology data (8), catalyzing numerous biological discoveries. Noteworthy publications that have utilized GeneLab include studies on mitochondrial dysfunction across species (9), short duration spaceflight on human health (10), kidney dysfunction (11), endocrinology (12), carbon dioxide impact (13), skin health (14), liver lipid dysregulation (15) and changes in the gut microbiome (16). Such pioneering work highlighted the need for all space biomedical data beyond molecular ‘omics to also be maximally open access and FAIR.

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.\nKeywords:\nspaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), optic nerve, retina, RNA-seq, artificial gravity",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionPhysiological and pathological neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been observed in astronauts that have undergone prolonged spaceflight, a phenomenon known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1,2,3]. Our previous rodent flight studies have shown that spaceflight induces adverse effects on retinal structure, blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and retinal function [4,5]. More recent research also reports optic nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optic nerve disc [6]. These findings warrant research on the role of spaceflight conditions, including microgravity (MG), on the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN) in the development of SANS [7]. To date, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of SANS.Changes in gravity are critical aspects of spaceflight which may contribute to adverse responses. Artificial gravity (AG) by centrifugal force is a potential countermeasure to mitigate the effects of MG on board the International Space Station (ISS) [8]. Rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS provide opportunities to assess the effectiveness of AG in space. Prior work from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mouse habitat unit-1 (MHU-1) showed that exposure to 1 G of AG effectively reduced endothelial cell damage and increased cellular organization and function in the RTN compared to the MG group without centrifugation [9]. Results from the same flight study also showed that mice exposed to artificial 1 G had reduced musculoskeletal deterioration associated with spaceflight [10]. These studies provide evidence that AG may protect against or mitigate the effects of MG. However, it is currently not known what gravity level and duration of gravitational force must be maintained to prevent or reduce retinal damage.For the current study, AG was generated by onboard short-radius centrifuges installed in the Centrifuge-Equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS, created by JAXA [10]. Mice were exposed to either MG alone (0 G), or to 0.33 G, 0.67 G, or 1 G by centrifugation for the duration of a 30-day flight mission. Our in-depth transcriptomic analysis allowed us to robustly characterize and compare molecular responses in the ON and RTN. This study aims to evaluate whether AG could mitigate the deleterious effects of MG on the RTN and ON during spaceflight. Our study also aims to compare the effectiveness of different AG levels and define the relationship between gravitational dose and cellular response by assessing an oxidative stress biomarker and transcriptomic endpoints. This information is expected to provide valuable knowledge of the mechanisms that contribute to ON/RTN dysfunction and facilitate the development of an optimal AG protocol for eye protection during spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nHuman exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with\n137\nCs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.\nKeywords:\ncytomegalovirus, radiation, galactic cosmic radiation, spaceflight, herpes viral reactivation",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionInfection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities.Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p< 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49."

        "Title": "Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nUNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active.\nC. elegans\nexpressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.\nSubject terms:\nCytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria",
        "Introduction": "IntroductionMuscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 inC. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions.Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegansgeneunc-89result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9.unc-89is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11(WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared.The Drosophila genome contains a singleunc-89gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies.Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19.Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924.Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26.Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1.PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231.So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability ofC. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication."

        "Title": "Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.\nResults\nIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.\nConclusion\nOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe environment of outer space, characterized by intense radiation and high vacuum, presents harsh conditions for any form of life. Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g.,Bacillus,Deinococcusspecies) [1,2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6,7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13].The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure,Bacillus pumilusSAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, driedDeinococcuscell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover,D. radioduransafter being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival ofD. radioduransexposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis ofB. pumilusSAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores ofB. pumilusSAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1].The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10,15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes.Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10,12,18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17,20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species,Bacillus safensisJPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24].This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig.1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained.Fig. 1.Open in a new tabOverview of the project.

        "Title": "Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.\nResults\nHere, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10\n6\nspore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10\n10\nwhen exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (\nQ\n< 0.05) and beta (\nR\n2\n= 0.307,\nP\n= 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (\nR\n2\n= 0.22,\nP\n= 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (\nQ\n< 0.05).\nConclusion\nOur results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.\nYour browser is not supporting the HTML5 <video> element.\nYou may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice.\nDownload video stream\n.\nDownload video file\n(167.1MB, mp4)\nOpen in a new tab\nVideo Abstract\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-024-01864-3.\nKeywords:\nBuilt environment, Fungi, Spacecraft, Relative humidity, Microbiome, Space biology, Moisture, Mold",

Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like\nExtibacter muris\nand\nDysosmobacter welbionis\n. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionThe International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions.Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9.Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10and mesenchymal stem11cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown ofsbp-1andmdt-15reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids.The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza andPseudomonas aeruginosahave been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37.Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the generaStaphylococcusandTyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p<0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the generaClostridium,Romboutsia,Ruminiclostridium, andShuttleworthia, and decreases inHungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment ofDoreasp. and the speciesLactobacillus murinus.In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig.1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight.Fig. 1.

        "Introduction": "IntroductionOver the last two decades, there have been tremendous advancements in stem cell biology within regenerative medicine as well as innovations in space technologies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been increasingly supportive of academic and commercial groups using microgravity for research and product development with potential benefits for use on Earth1,2. There is a growing interest in evaluating the potential for stem cells and their derived tissues in space to model human disease mechanisms and treat diseases through cell therapy.At the start of human spaceflight, the primary focus of life science research conducted in space was to understand the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment including microgravity on humans to keep them alive and well in this extreme environment. Additionally, medical research in space has uncovered valuable evidence about the effects of microgravity on the human condition including biological processes and disease pathways. A great wealth of knowledge about cells and tissues has been known in biomedical space research. In recent years, there has been an emerging interest from scientists, governments, and commercial entities to investigate human health in space for the benefit of humans on Earth too. Studying stem cells in space has uncovered their behavior in an environment other than Earth, revealing mechanisms which would otherwise be undetected or unknown with the inevitable presence of normal gravity. This includes changes to stem cell proliferation rates, differentiation, and lineage phenotypes3–6. Stem cell research performed in space has shown potential ways microgravity can be leveraged to advance cellular therapeutics in space to benefit human life and commercial enterprise on Earth7. This paper reviews important discoveries that have occurred in real microgravity conditions on the ISS demonstrating the impact of microgravity on fundamental stem cell properties relevant to regenerative medicine practices and therapeutics on Earth3,8–14. We present here different areas of stem cell research conducted in space that have potential to translate to terrestrial applications within the context of developing cellular therapies while also highlighting the limitations and opposing evidence available. Prior to these spaceflight studies, little was known about the role of microgravity in influencing human stem cell growth and fate. We are just starting to understand the ways in which a microgravity environment influences stem cell function, division, and survival."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nNatural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.\nSubject terms:\nTumour immunology, Haematological cancer",

In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis. During future missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), such as those NASA and other space agencies are planning to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and Mars, astronauts will be exposed to a complex ionizing radiation (IR) environment, consisting of solar energetic particles (SEP) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) that contain high atomic number and energy (HZE) charged particles. The high linear energy transfer (LET) and correspondingly higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of HZE particles will expose astronauts on exploration missions to cumulative IR doses that could increase cancer risk4–7. This possibility led NASA to identify space radiation-induced carcinogenesis as one of the top “red” risks limiting long-duration missions in deep space8,9[https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/intro/]. While there are no documented cases of space radiation-induced cancer in astronauts who have flown in space, this is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of astronauts who have flown in space have done so aboard the ISS, which orbits at an altitude of only 254 miles above the surface of the Earth. Since the Earth’s magnetosphere, which provides a shield from space radiation8–10, extends out to a distance of roughly 37,000 miles from the Earth, astronauts board the ISS receive very minimal exposures to space radiation. While astronauts that flew the Apollo missions to the lunar surface traveled beyond this distance, these missions were very short in duration (days), and they were carefully timed to coincide with the period each month during which the Moon falls within the Earth’s 370,000 mile long magnetotail, thereby shielding these astronauts from any significant exposures. NASA and other space agencies are planning extended missions on the lunar surface, missions to near-Earth asteroids, and ultimately manned missions to Mars, all of which will place astronauts well beyond the protection of Earth’s magnetosphere for long periods of time (the current estimate for a roundtrip Mars mission is ~3 years). As such, astronauts will be exposed to significant doses11,12of solar energetic particles (“SEP”, high energy protons) and galactic cosmic rays (“GCR”, atomic nuclei stripped of their outer electron shells), the biological impact of which is currently not well understood. Highlighting the potential for carcinogenesis as a result of exposure to the types and doses of IR to which astronauts will be exposed, we previously reported13the induction of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mice that were repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses11,12of56Fe ions. This is the only report to-date of a human malignancy following exposure to space radiation. While these findings are concerning in their own right, the well documented dysregulation of multiple facets of the immune response that occurs during even short duration spaceflight14–17suggests that accurate cancer risk assessment during future multiple-year missions in deep space will require consideration of not just the incidence of carcinogenesis arising from IR exposure, but also the fitness of the astronauts’ anti-tumor immunity.Given their key role in anti-tumor immunity, several studies have begun addressing the effect of spaceflight on the functionality of human NK cells18–26. While these studies have collectively revealed that spaceflight stressors, in particular microgravity, negatively impact NK cells, it is important to note that these studies were all conducted on Earth under conditions of normal gravity. Specifically, in the studies utilizing NK cells from crew members, cells were isolated during or immediately following spaceflight, and they were then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Similarly, in all of the in vitro studies using ground-based analogs of microgravity such as the NASA-designed Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV - Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX, USA), cytotoxicity assays were performed after culture of NK cells for a period of time in simulated microgravity, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4 h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27–30, it is possible that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4 h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of NK function in “real-time” during spaceflight.To better model the ability of astronauts’ NK cells to continually monitor for and eliminate any transformed cells that emerge as a result of exposure to SEP/GCR radiation, and thereby be able to accurately estimate cancer risk, we performed studies, using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight. We utilized both standard K-562 cells and T-ALL cells as targets, given our prior work demonstrating the induction of this malignancy as a result of exposure of human HSC to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions. Results obtained in conditions of continuous microgravity were then compared to those obtained with “traditional” methods in which NK cells were exposed to simulated microgravity, centrifuged, and then cocultured with target cells under normal gravity. Our results show that NK function is significantly more impaired when simulated microgravity conditions are maintained uninterrupted throughout the cytotoxicity assay period, suggesting prior work may have underestimated the impact microgravity exerts on these critical immune cells. Of particular note was the marked reduction in cytotoxicity against T-ALL, raising the novel and troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO. These data thus highlight the need for further research to address the question of the role microgravity may play in the induction of neoplastic transformation/cancer development. RNA-seq analyses on NK cells isolated from two healthy adult human donors revealed myriad pathways that were altered by simulated microgravity, paving the way for future studies to develop targeted countermeasures to help mitigate this risk and safeguard astronaut health."

        "Title": "Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease.",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nMicrogravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.\nKeywords:\nhindlimb unloading, microgravity, cardiovascular system, immune response, transcriptomics",
        "Introduction": "1. IntroductionSpaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks.The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19].Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue."

        "Title": "Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment",
        "Abstract": "Abstract\nSpending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca\n2+\ndysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca\n2+\nATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca\n2+\nfrom the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca\n2+\nuptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III)\nmeso\n-tetrakis(\nN\n-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP\n5+\n(BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca\n2+\nleak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca\n2+\nleak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca\n2+\nleak.\nSubject terms:\nCalcium channels, Physiology",
